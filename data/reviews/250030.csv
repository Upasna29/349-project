Thankfully Lilly carries with her a set of magical goggles that enable our titular heroine to see each area in alternate dimensions which helps in solving most of the conundrums Lilly will find herself in during her brief but incredibly sweet adventure.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=268298540\nLilly Looking Through barely contains any narrative other than what is set up at the start of the game - the search for and rescue of your younger brother Row. Lilly Looking Through further embraces its minimalism by abandoning the adventure game trope of inventories filled to the brim with items that may or may not be of any aid in your adventures.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=256484781\nLilly Looking Through is not a particularly long or challenging game and most gamers should breeze through the ten different areas in about 2hrs. Some of the later areas do require the player to be cognisant of their surroundings such as the color-based puzzles and will require some out of the box thinking in order to get past but given the world that Lilly inhabits they are not so obtuse as to be completely out of place with the adventure and the world that the game sets up for you to explore. Solving each areas puzzle will require Lilly to do something, move something or climb something whilst often alternating between each areas dimension.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=268301950\nThe difficulty curve is gently matched as each areas puzzles become more and more complex but not complex in such a way that hours, days or weeks could be spent by the die-hard adventurist (he/she who refuses to view a walkthrough of any kind) as they attempt to solve a particularly challenging game world riddle. To support the puzzles, GEETA GAMES, have crafted one of the most visually stunning adventures games to come along in recent years. Each area and its alternate dimension is lovingly hand-painted and are frequently gorgeous to look at. Equally as stunning is the games soundtrack. Each area has its own distinct and soothing melody that was just as lovely to listen too as the hand-painted backgrounds where to look at.\n\nLilly Looking Through is a gentle adventure game that can be cracked open and completed on a lazy Sunday afternoon and one that I found was a pleasant diversion from all the bombast and never-ending length that has become the AAA game of late. If I had to nit-pick I would say that Lilly is ultimately let down by its ending that does very little to explain what came before, during or even after the adventure ends. I imagine that, given GEETA GAMES budget constraints (this was a kickstarter funded project), there was a larger tale its makers wanted to tell but were unable to do so financially hence the rather abrupt and confusing ending. Hopefully Lilly Looking Through generates enough cash to see the story continue because while the game may err on the short side (very short side) it's a charming place to inhabit for a single afternoon.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 7, 2014","true","3.3"," 52 of 66 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","52","66","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/recommended/250030/","mikeoliva","Motoki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikeoliva/","4611 products in account","TL;DR - Wait for a bundle. It's cute but short and tedious with no story and no replay value.\n\nLilly looking through is a point and click atmospheric puzzle game. I hesitate to even call it an Adventure game because there's no dialog and really no story at all. It's basically a short series screens designed to create an atmosphere of whimsy with puzzles to stretch the time out. The one story element there is, chasing the little boy, is really nothing more than a macguffin to get you to the next screen.\n\nAt no time are we ever told who these kids are, where they come from, what world they are in, what the rules of it are, why they are there, where if anywhere they were planning or going and what if anything they were planning on doing before the boy was swept away.\n\nThat it appears to be presented in a package of magical whimsical mystery is just covering for the fact that in actuality there is no story at all. It's just an experience game made to set a mood and impression. That the bulk of the short play time is made up of puzzles that once figured out are almost immediately solvable the second time around and beyond just means it's experience game that you'll really only want to play once.\n\nSpeaking of the puzzles, every time you have Lilly click to go somewhere or do something you to wait. Having to sit through the slow animations every single time and not being able to skip or cancel them no matter how many times you were redoing the same motions made me want to stab my eyes out. It was just so tedious.\n\nThe fact that this game is still very short in spite of all this tediousness and the fact that they reached their Kickstarter stretch goal to make the game longer is really saying something.\n\nIf you come to the end and think 'That's it?' a short length of a game is more likely to feel noticeable and problematic than another game of the same length with a satisfying conclusion that feels like a complete, whole experience. To the Moon is a good example of the latter. It is short but that never feels problematic because there's a definite, clear conclusion that makes sense in the context of the game and the journey.\n\nThis game in comparison definitely gives a 'Huh? That's it? What does that even mean?' feel at the end which just makes the short length all the more noticeable and unforgivable. If you are going to make a game first and foremost about soaking up the atomsphere framed by gameplay that that gives no replayability to speak of then at least make it long enough so that we feel we get enough time in that world to soak up the atmosphere.\n\nSeeing as it's both short and without a story, all your are left with is a short time with a feeling of whimsy that's mostly padded out by puzzles made tedious due to all the slow unskippable animations between motions.\n\nLastly, I want to talk about pricing and packages. I bought the 'Deluxe Edition' through their Humble store. The regular version for $10 pre-order at the humble store did not come with a Steam key. The 'Deluxe Edition' for $15 did. It also came with a PDF artbook, which turned out to be very short and mostly just pictures of one particular locale in the game. It's also the same PDF they are giving at GOG for $9, the price of the regular version minus 10% off new release sale. They literally charged $5 extra to for a Steam key if you bought the game from the Humble Store which is not only shady, I've honestly never seen another developer do this.\n\nThe music was excellent, relaxing, magical sounding and ambient and the best thing about the game in my opinion. It would have been nice if this had come with the 'Deluxe Edition' for $15. It didn't. The soundtrack will put you out another $10. I'll pass as I've already spent more than I should have for what I ended up getting. It's a real shame because I wanted to love this game.","November 2, 2013","false","6.1"," 68 of 95 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","68","95","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/recommended/250030/","bastwood","Bastwood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bastwood/","689 products in account","Short and relatively charming adventure in the vein of Samorost and Botanicula. No inventory management, no verbs, no dialogue, just clicking hotspots on the screen in the right order. Nice animation and graphics, soothing music and the puzzles occasionally provide a challenge. Sadly the challenge is more about trying to figure out what you should be doing than actually solving the problem itself - the age-old Myst™ curse. You find yourself spending lots of time flipping colored switches with no concept of what you're supposed to accomplish.\n\nThe story doesn't really make much sense or seem to be going anywhere. When it finally does the game just abruptly ends, and the said anticlimax just seems to underline the already short length of the game. If you've already played all Amanita Design games and still want more, then and only then consider Lilly Looking Through. Lilly doesn't quite fall in the same league, but is pleasant enough to waste a couple of hours with.","November 2, 2013","true","2.5"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

I'm probably gonna get shot in the head for this, but, Lilly Looking Through just feels like wasted potential. When I was going into this game, I had high expectations because people were saying it's good, and that it's like Machinarium and so on. After finishing the game (yes, it was that short), I don't feel like it's really that great.\n\nLilly Looking Through is a story about a girl named Lilly, who has to rescue her brother Row, from a... magcial cloth who has appeard to taken Row away. Yeah. Anyway, let's start with pros. The pros are that the game is charming and whatever, and has a nice setting. You can switch between two worlds to solve puzzles in and the art style is really cool. The animation in this game is wonderful, and it just looks overall great. The game isn't too hard, and you'll have fun playing it. Maybe.\n\nNow it's time for the long list of cons. Some are personal, some are obvious.\n\n1. The game is waaay too short. After finishing a puzzle, I was thinking what would happen next to these two protagonists. Then the game ends. Seriously. On a cliffhanger. One second I'm partially enjoying myself and the next second the credits are rolling.\n2. YOU CANNOT skip animations. So whenever you're doing a puzzle, you have to watch every slow animation Lilly makes. It looks nice, but not when you're sitting there for minutes watching Lilly shamble on. These long animations actually help lengthen the already short game time. It makes the game super tedious and I can't enjoy it if it's like that.\n3. Variety. There were a lot of the same puzzles. Ones with color mixing. I no like colors. I never thought a really short game could get repetitive.\n4. Random. There's an appearance from Lilly's Grandpa at the end that had nothing to do with anything and it baffled the ♥♥♥♥ out of me. Also, there's like 5 lines of voice acting that randomly appear and I don't get it.\n\nOverall, I wanted to like this game, but I just couldn't bring myself to enjoy it. There were a lot of cool things, but when you stop and look at it, you'll realize that there's problems abound. With that said, I wouldn't mind a sequel with some improvements or a new game from these guys. There's still a lot of potential here.","February 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

The "solutions" might as well be arbitrary, I recommend you use a guide for all the color puzzles\n- it's so rarely clear what to do. This isn't like "I want the solution" - I like hard puzzles. But the aim is just totally unknown - for one puzzle the magic solution is yellow, for another it's red. No indication why.\n- the story is bland and ends so abruptly I felt like I'd fallen off a cloud.\n- animation delay. This is a killer. Every single action has a second padding front and back when you can't do anything. At first this seems laid back... in the later puzzles where you need to make 50 or so animations in a row, it drives insane rather than creating a relaxing feel.","November 11, 2014","false","2.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","3"

A hint; game mechanics don't usually change without any sort of a note - as in, the player suddenly being allowed to click during cutscenes/animations. Similarly, the puzzles themselves are somewhat tedious and repetitive. The animation sequences take a long time and are forced on the player, meaning that sometimes (yes, I mean the pipe extension) the player will spend 10 minutes repeating a tedious task over and over, with animation and loading inbetween each inch of progress.\n\nNo, I would not recommend this to anyone; it seems half finished and not nearly as good as most other puzzle games.","November 11, 2014","false","2.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","0"

Absolutely magical art.\n—A pair of magical goggles that transport you between past/present versions of the current scene (kinda like DOTT)\n—At least one of the time-exploitation puzzles (the one involving trees) is very neat and clever\n—Rather than inventory puzzles, LLT relies more on Myst-style machine-manipulation puzzles, which is a flavor I greatly enjoy and wish I could find in more games.\n\nCONS:\n\n—Every thing you click on plays a kinda slow/lengthy animation. Many puzzles require you to perform the same action over and over again, and it gets incredibly old watching these long, slow animations play out over and over again.\n\n—The game’s coolest feature is the past/present time swapping goggles, but it is woefully, woefully underused.\n\n—The game’s very first serious puzzle (i.e. the bubble pond) is one of the most frustrating puzzles in the game and may turn some people off right at the front door.\n\n—Several puzzles in the game are based on color-swapping, but the puzzles don’t make sense. They end up being trial and error puzzles instead of puzzles where you work toward something that makes practical sense.\n\n—The very last puzzle of the game is an illogical mess. You will most likely only solve it by guessing or by looking up a walkthrough.\n\n—The game has no ending. Literally. It just abruptly ends with no apology or explanation. You solve the last puzzle, and then there is a short cutscene, and then Lilly finds herself in a new situation, and it appears as if this is a new room and a new puzzle is about to start, and then…. credits????? The ending is so painfully abrupt that it’s almost indistinguishable from a game crash. The barely-there story gets no resolution, no explanation, nothing.\n\n--Very, very, very short. (About 2 hours, maybe a little less.)\n\nThis game is really beautiful, but it’s got some serious flaws that hold it back from being great. Here’s what it would need for true greatnesss:\n\n+Some playtesting of the puzzles. A couple of them are painfully illogical/obtuse (especially that last one, holy hell).\n\n+In fact, get rid of all of the silly color-based puzzles. Those puzzles are the worst offenders. The past/present time-swapping is the most interesting thing about this game and there is not nearly enough of it.\n\n+Actually finish making the game.\n\nI'm going to recommend this game to people who love point-and-click adventures, child-like wonder, and Myst-style machine-manipulation puzzles. However, I recommend it with a huge caveat, because I am not exaggerating in the least about the cons mentioned above. If you go into this game with your expectations appropriately adjusted, you may enjoy yourself for the evening.","May 22, 2015","true","2.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","16","20","2","3"

It's beautiful and the characters are fairly unique. However, if you are a point-and-click adventure purist, you'll probably be turned off by it. Just look at the top reviews. I agree with many of the sentiments, but I still feel like this was a good game. I only recommend getting this game while it's on sale.\n\nIn the first part of the game, the puzzles are fairly easy to solve. I was glad about this as I usually get stuck early on with other P&C games. However, as the game progresses, the puzzles get weird. Many of them require A LOT of experimentation just to determine the function and mechanics of everything, especially with the goggles. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal, but you have to wait for Lilly to perform each action, including moving from one point to another. Much of the time logged in the game is waiting for action execution. The objective isn't always clear. Even if you can figure out what everything does, you might not know what you're supposed to be doing. The underwater bells were maddening, and I ended up using a walkthrough.\n\nThe game itself is a mystery. The description doesn't help. It says that the ultimate mystery would be unlocked, but that doesn't happen. I'm left with questions. What world is this? Where are all the other people? Why is the curtain magical? What is with the ending? Basically, the whole plot is missing except for Lilly trying to rescue her brother. The only reason I don't really complain is because I enjoyed the journey.\n\nIt is short. It only takes a few hours to complete. I'm sure that many of the scenes could've been utilized further without overcomplicating it. If nothing else, use them to add some backstory to the world or provide a simple reaction to being clicked. A few things did the latter, such as a locked door, but it could've been done more. Even though the game is short, I'm okay with it. I don't have a lot of time to game, so I like being able to complete certain games in an evening or two.\n\nYes, the game has its shortcomings, but it's still fun.\n\n---\n\nFor more...

So you will be left feeling unsatisfied.   Otherwise it's a really nice little adventure game.\n\nI truly do hate to give this game a Not Recommend.\n\nIt's a cutely animated game, with some pleseant music, interesting locations, and a unique concept.  There are a few challenging puzzles (a couple of them are anyway).   Though it's fairly simple for a point and click adventure.  There are only a few options presented at any time as to what you can interract with and do, so depending on how you look at that it's either good or bad.    Bad perhaps in that it makes solving the puzzles easier, if you like greater challenge,  but good in that you aren't presented with options to do things which are no longer useful, so you'll have less frustration.\n\nThat said,  this game is VERY short.  I completed it in about 3.5 hours, and that is without looking up any guides or using any hints to solve the puzzles.   My shown time includes at least an hour and a half of idle AFK time during various play sessions.\n\nIt's not only very short, but I'm almost certain that it is actually unfinished.\n\nWhen you solve the final puzzle, you find yourself not in any resolved state, having figured out what has been going on this whole time (or at least making it back home safe and sound),  but in a very precarious situation clearly nowhere near home. Then the credits simply roll.   And this after in the previous scene having met/seen someone who might help explain things.   I had to watch through the entire credits (which aren't that long thankfully),  thinking I would see some explanation, a final cut scene, or at least a "To be continued...", but nope, that was it.\n\nSo in the end, though an enjoyable journey for the most part,  you are left feeling very unsatisfied and unfulfilled at the end.   Should they ever finish this game, with hopefully at least a couple more scenes (ideally more) to properly wrap up the story, it would be a Recommend for sure.\n\nIf you are willing to deal with these caveats and can get this game for a steal, then it's worth it if you know what to expect going in.","July 11, 2015","false","5.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/recommended/250030/","hippyshake","Hippyshake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/","1352 products in account","(Please see the UPDATE below review.)\n\nBy now, everyone knows: "Lilly Looking Through" is charming, beautifully animated, and very fluid. The music has an ethereal quality that doesn't distract. In a nice touch, as you put on or remove the time-changing goggles the music changes too, depending on which "time" you're in.\n\nAs is typical for the genre, there are times when the game becomes not quite a pixel hunt, but "let's mouseover the entire screen to see what I've missed (or what's changed)." Unfortunately, there are also times when you click on things without a clear understanding of what your actual goal is. When you do make a successful attempt, Lilly's actions may actually surprise you, as she does something you may not have been trying to get her to do in the first place. In other words, there is one solution to each screen, and only one. Most of the puzzles make sense (if only in hindsight), but it does mean that if you're not on the developer's wavelength, too bad. The game does not save after you complete a puzzle, but only after you complete a screen. If you leave partway through a screen, you'll have to repeat your puzzle solutions up to that point on that particular screen (which should take less than a minute, as you've already done it once).\n\nThere is only one game at a time, which means that if other people in your house want to play as well, they'll either have to play your game or wait until you've finished. Frankly, as this is being marketed as a family game, I don't understand the lack of multiple player slots at all.\n\nAll that said, I did find myself enchanted by the game for the first hour. An hour later, however, I found myself finished, frustrated, and a bit stunned at the overall lack of purpose. My total time played was 2:33, but that includes a 15 minute period where I literally kept trying different combinations of switches on one screen simply because I had missed seeing an important lever and had no idea what else to do. If I had noticed it earlier, I would have had around 2:18 for my total playtime. It's also important to note that much of the game's running time is simply you sitting back as a several-second animation plays out every time you click on something. You cannot cancel an animation, even if it's the twentieth time you've seen it (and with some of the trial-and-error puzzles, you will be sitting back and waiting a lot).\n\nThe irony here is that the first Kickstarter stretch goal allowed them to actually make the game longer, so I'm at a bit of a loss. Every Indie game is a labor of love (I would hope), but this one feels so much more so, and so special (even to the point of being developed and voiced by a family) that it really does pain me that I can't recommend it at full price. Yes, it's obvious a lot of work went into it. Yes, I hate myself a little. However, how do we learn, grow, and improve, if not from our mistakes? How will we ever know about those mistakes if people constantly bury the truth in favor of praise for our hard work? I'd rather have a constructive criticism than an insincere "attaboy" any day. With that in mind, take a deep breath, 'cause here we go.\n\nNot only is "Lilly..." short, but the puzzles tend to feel repetitive, particularly with four consecutive color-matching puzzles on the last four screens (the final screen also combines that same color gimmick with mechanics from an earlier puzzle). I stopped having fun after the second color puzzle, but when I realized that final screen was yet another one (the fourth in a row), I actually began to resent the game. This color-matching idea is milked so often, it leaves me wondering if these were the stretch goal additions.\n\nAnd then...the "ending." Which is to say, there isn't one. While avoiding spoilers, I'll say that it literally is a cliffhanger; that is, it would be if we cared about the characters. How can we though, without any reason to? Lilly and the little boy are cute, but there's nothing else to them. I understand minimalist storytelling but, for me, it doesn't work. I've chased a red piece of cloth (and the boy) across ten screens, only to have it be replaced at the end by something so completely random, open-ended, and esoteric that I'm left thinking there was absolutely no point in my playing, no reward for my work, no reason for the red piece of cloth to have existed at all. It's such a thoughtless MacGuffin that it feels like a bit of a slap in the face.\n\nI sincerely hate writing this but, as a gaming experience, "Lilly Looking Through" gets two stars out of five. The game's length, repetitiveness, and ending completely undermined the joy I felt the first hour of play. That said, the love, creativity (for the most part) and passion is there for great things in the future, and I really do hope "Lilly..." finds a solid enough market that Geeta Games can keep growing and producing games.\n\nUPDATE: This review was originally written the day of the game's release (I had previously joined the Kickstarter). Today, almost a year later, I found Lilly in an old bundle as an add-on game that I had never noticed.  I popped it onto Steam, gave it another go, and am saddened to report that NONE of the initial problems have been fixed. Cut scenes still take forever (with no way of bypassing them), and the game's optimization level is ridiculously poor at times (particularly the underwater sequence), even at lower resolutions.  Lilly currently sits at a $10 price point (down from $15), and I think that's still too much for a two-hour game with no replay value (this time I completed it in less than an hour), no real story,  only one save spot, repetitive puzzles, and no ending.  If you can get it in a bundle, then do so to admire its ample charm. More than $5 and I'd pass.","September 1, 2014","false","1.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

It is best taken at a slow and relaxed pace. The art is fantastic and the gameplay mechanics suit perfectly.   I enjoyed this game from start to finish.\n\nLilly Looking through is about the tale of a brother and a sister.  You don't know where they are from, where they are, or why the world is like what it is.   Some may consider this lazyness, but I however, find that this actually helps emphasis the characters themselves.   They're sweet and charming.  Throughout the game the single minded child like nature of the characters is evident and enhanced by the simplicity of the environments of the world.\n\nEven though the art style is simple and beautiful the puzzles this game present can be quite cunning.  Given the short length of the game the difficulty curve is quite steep. However, the basic premise of most of the puzzles makes solving them challenging, but never threatening.  It doesn't aim to increase the difficulty by providing lots of places to click, or by confusing you.\n\nMy one warning with this game is that you cannot rush it.  You must not rush it.  To fully enjoy it you must be willing to enjoy the art, ask yourself what has happened and why.  This game rewards freedom of imagination.  If you want a game which fully explains itself this is not the game for you.

Puzzles are either a bit too straightforward or obtuse, with little sense or excitement behind most of them.  The solution to most puzzles is to just change world modes, and for the others its fiddling with button machines until you figure out what the buttons do.  The setting is extremely thin, in that you have a goal and a world but nothing beyond that.  The world has no explanation or cohesiveness, just arbitrary locales.  The story is more or less chasing after your friend / sibling who keeps being dragged off screen by a magic red cloth, and the game neither explains why this is happening nor does the story go any further than this.\n\nThe game has nice background music, and is visually pleasant to look at.  The voice audio sounds fairly low quality, and they could have done with adding a few more variations.  The 'grunt as character falls on the ground' sound is a good example as you hear it fairly often, consist of just one sample, and sometimes is played multiple times in a row.   The characters say only a few words and dont emote that much.\n\nAll in all, I do not recommend this game.  It provides at most 2 hours of content with no replayability.  I would not recommend a purchase even at a sale price as low as $2.50 (75% off the base price $10) as there are simply many other more enjoyable games to play even at that price point.

It was just me and the world around me.  In a way, Lilly Looking Through is an extension of this philosophy of figuring out what’s going on on your own.  In a gaming environment filled with action titles that make your muscles twitch like crazy, it’s a fresh change of pace to sit back and leisurely move through each screen and just enjoying the ambiance.  And it’s a great game that can be played by children of all ages.  After reaching the end I found myself wanting more.  I highly recommend this game to anyone with children or just want something short to unwind from a long day.\n\nhttp://www.kickstartadventure.com/home/lilly-looking-through-review/","November 4, 2013","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you can get it in a bundle or for less than a buck or two, by all means - go ahead, purchase and play it. I, personally, did not buy it with physical money. I purchased it, from a friend who got it in a bundle, with virtual currency from another site that I play on. I almost (almost) feel cheated for how much I spent, even virtually.\n\nLilly Looking Through has less than two hours of gameplay to it. With only ten (or so) levels, it's definitely not a game that you want to sap time. The only thing that Lilly Looking Through has going for it, I think, is the fact that it is so absolutely beautiful and (kind of) relaxing. The puzzles do get tedious (as other players have mentioned), the solutions oft-times seem extremely arbitrary with no actual reason, and the game itself seems to be compiled of mostly filler play.\n\nIf I remember correctly, Lilly Looking Through was intended to be a short story. I think it should have been kept that way and not fashioned into a game. The ending is extremely abrupt, and I literally had no idea it was over until the credits started rolling and my boyfriend asked, "Is it over?" to which I responded that I think so.\n\nThere's absolutely no conclusion; the game appears to have been built on a cliffhanger, almost as if it was the end of one "part" and there is another part to follow. If there is, I do look forward to seeing the rest of the story. If not... well, I suppose that's that. For those of you who can't stand a lack of ending, don't play it until we know more.","April 26, 2015","false","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I.E. You do something in one plane of the world, it sometimes effects something on the other plane, and vice versa.\n\nIn at least some of the scenarios, it seems like you're time traveling, which is pretty cool, like for example in this one puzzle: Where you scare a squirrel away, so it doesn't steal the acorns that drop down after shaking a tree branch, funnel a stream of water with a curved branch, grab an acorn, and place it on spots with water, which is then an instantly fully grown tree that you can climb over when you switch worlds, so more or less its some sort of time travel mechanic.\n\nSo if you're into interesting point and click games with a wacky mechanic or two, try this when its on sale, otherwise its a tad too short for its normal price tag.","October 15, 2014","true","2.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its laid back feel makes it a good unwinding game.\n\nI like this game, but I can't say I love this game, mainly because theres times where it just feels TOO SLOW. Especially compounded by the small animated sequences that play whenever your click on something just bog down the process of solving a tricky puzzle.

The ambient music really supports this game.\n\nBut... when I got to the end, I was left hoping for more. That's a good thing. It means I really enjoyed the experience. But, I'm hoping this is just an indie game still in development/expansion, and there's a future free update coming that adds more chapters to the story.\n\nI do believe more is coming. In the final scene, if you put on the glasses, there's a brief glimpse of her grandpa. He's apparently responsible for sending off the magical red scarf that drew Lilly and her brother into this whole adventure. I sense there's a lot more "history" to this world too, left to be explained.\n\nDear developers: please expand on this game and include it as a free update to those of us who purchased the game.

You take the role of the titular tot in a quest to rescue a small boy (it's never explicitly stated, but I beleive it is Lilly's brother).  Throughout the gaem you'll encounter several unqiue locations with some occationally tricky but still logical puzzles.  You never feel trolled in the fashion that Sierra or LucasArts games inspire.\n\nOn the down side, the game is relatively short, ends upbruptly, and doesn't make much effort to create a narrative.  While I certainly enjoyed myself, and would likely purchase a LLT sequal or other titles from this studio, it might be hard to suggest to someone that wants maximum bang for their gaming dollar.  The full game can be completed in about an hour, possibly 2 hours if you get stuck.","December 29, 2013","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

LLT utilizes a light world/dark world effect in its puzzle-solving that works decently enough.  Most puzzles are logical but if you're anything like me, you looked for a walkthrough once mixing colors came up.  The last couple puzzles of the game rely on this and the color wheel is a foreign thing to me.  Asking me to mix colors to solve a puzzle is a death wish.\n\nAnimations for the characters are well-done and have a lot of charm but one complaint I have regarding them is they can't be skipped or sped up, so if you're messing up a puzzle numerous times, you'll have to sit through the somewhat slow animations and back and forth every time.

The graphics are adorable (as can be seen in the screenshots), the gameplay functionality uses a simple point-and-click method, and it is completely free of monsters or anything else scary. This, of course, means that it truly is safe to play with the kids if you have any. In addition to this, it has a nice soundtrack and some interesting puzzles. However, it also has some downsides. For one, the game is full of slow-moving cut-scenes, every time you do something, which cannot be skipped. Also, there is absolutely no background or story provided within the game itself (really no dialog or screen text at all, in fact), and not much of a plot, all of which, depending who you are, might or might not bother you. The major downside to this is that there is also no real explanation given of what you are meant to accomplish in any given puzzle, and several are far from clear just from looking at them. Therefore, there is a lot of either randomly doing things until something happens that works to solve the puzzle, or else seeking an explanation online or in the forums of what your final goal in a puzzle is meant to be. It is also quite short, has little replayability in practical terms, and has an ending that is a bit abrupt. That being said however, with the exception of a couple more tedious puzzles, I truly did enjoy playing it most of the time. So, if you're into cute point-and click adventures, and have a certain amount of patience, then this might well be a good choice for you. I would advise watching for it to be on sale or part of a bundle though, as there simply aren't enough hours of gameplay here for me to be able to recommend it as a good buy at full price.","January 15, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KafroHudrep/recommended/250030/","KafroHudrep","Kafro Hudrep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KafroHudrep/","352 products in account","Lilly Looking Through is a minimalist point-and-click adventure game about a girl named Lilly who goes to save her little brother Row from a mysterious magical scarf with the help of mysterious magical goggles. Going from one beautifully-painted environment to the next, the challenge comes from figuring out the functions of Lilly's surroundings and how to use them to proceed. The main gimmick of the game is the ability to shift between two distinct versions of an area via aforementioned goggles to either bypass obstacles or manipulate one to alter the other; the game's description states that this is supposed to represent looking into the past to change the present, though that information doesn't explicitly come up in the game itself, nor is anything else in the game really expounded upon. In short, think of a cross between an Amanita Design title (Machinarium) and Chrono Trigger.\n\nUnfortunately, while the game is pleasing to look at and the sound design is equally soothing, the game suffers from a lack of polish and repetition, which is quite surprising for a game that clocks in at just under two hours. One of the first things I noticed about the game is that the character animations are slow and appear to run at around 12 frames per second. These are apparently not skippable, so every time I took an action I would have to wait around 10 seconds before I could continue, which was incredibly tedious whenever I made a mistake. Worse yet, quite a few of the puzzles follow a similar pattern of moving something to the right position by using the same switch over and over and watching the same animation again and again; this is not problem solving, this is busywork.\n\nAdditionally, the game is not as enchanting and wondrous as it probably wishes it were. In a story seldom told with words, it is usually up to expressive animation to give characterization to the cast, but for the most part Lilly reacts to her journey with dull bemusement, if even that. Lilly's world, pretty as it may be, is quite lifeless as well. There are some neat locations, but they don't feel like an actual setting as opposed to a string of set pieces. There are some animals here and there, but they don't really do anything delightful or engaging. To say the least, if you're looking for a "charming" game, Lilly Looking Through will not suffice.\n\nLast of all, while the game would have at least been conclusive by ending with Lilly rescuing her brother, it extends a bit past that, introduces a character as some sort of plot twist, and then finishes on a gigantic cliffhanger both confusing and unsatisfying. To reiterate, none of this is explained, and the "ultimate mystery" mentioned in the game's description is never actually touched upon. It leaves the impression that the developers had an entire second half of the game planned that they just did not have the resources for.\n\nIt's quite a shame, as the juxtaposition between the pristine past and the derelict present implies a far more complex history to the world of Lilly Looking Through than meets the eye, and I do still want to see what happens next. Perhaps if a sequel is released this game will retroactively become better than it currently is, but for now it's nothing more than a few screens of lovely scenery.","October 8, 2014","false","1.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Then you end up being able to travel through time, see ghosts, and then end up on some wierd cloudy island. I really have no idea what is going on.\n\nThe graphics are not great. The background are very nice, but the character models seem somewhat disjointed to it. I don't really feel they match the style of the backgrounds. This coupled with some severe framerate issues which made the game feel very sluggish made it a bit hard to play.

You click on spots to move and items to interact. Pretty basic stuff. Everything you can click on is clear when you're in range because once you hover over it your cursor will change. The draw here is the art and the mystery. You get drawn in initially because you're just thrown into the world and start looking around at what to do and what effects your actions have on the world around you. You use these interactions to progress through the game. Also, part way through you get these goggles that switch between two versions of the world. It's a nice little twist. The art is pretty and some of the puzzles are neat. However, this game has a lot of issues.\n\nFor one, everything is very slow. The animations are interesting, but once you've seen it once you get the idea. So if you leave the game and start an area over or just have to run through a cycle of tasks to solve a puzzle, you'll be seeing the same slow animations a lot. The interface is also a bit vague. Some of the puzzles are confusing and... while I get that's the point, some of them want you to use colors as part of the problem solving which is hard for those who have issues differentiating colors... such as myself. While I didn't bother finishing the game, there was only one more section for me to do, and from the videos and posts I've seen... the game just kind of ends. So you'd better enjoy the art, the puzzles, and the mystery because there's not much of a story here at all. Plus, it's rather short, only about two to three hours long.\n\nI know I didn't finish the game, but it just got too tedious for me. I entered into a giveaway for the game because... well... my last name is Lilly. So I got it for free. And honestly, it's not necessarily a genre I'm super fond of. I guess I might be being a bit harsh on it, but I can't recommend it for a simple reason... value. This game costs 10 bucks full price, but only last about 2 hours. While you might enjoy the experience, unless it really speaks to you on a deeper level, it's not really worth the price tag. Maybe look for a trade or a sale but... I really can't recommend it as is. I just didn't find enough enjoyment here to recommend it to anyone else. Lilly Looking Through gets a 3 out of 10 for having some redeeming qualities, but ultimately falling short of its potential.","October 12, 2015","false","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I wish I read about the lackluster (understatement) ending in reviews beforehand, because I felt robbed as a player. No closure, no satisfaction. I could maybe forgive that if the last scene made any sense, but it doesn't. And to make it worse, the final "reveal" is only shown for maybe 2 seconds before the credits roll, so you don't even get time to look around for visual hints.\n\nSTORY\nI'm not even sure what the story is, to be honest. Nothing is explained. Other than the overarching "solve puzzles to find and save someone" umbrella plot, you get no hints about who or where these characters are, why the goggles do what they do, why Lilly can breathe underwater, etc etc etc.\n\nBut let's assume you don't care if a game has a story/plot.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nI enjoyed the "swapping worlds" mechanic of the goggles. There are a couple of other games that involve a "magic lens" of some kind, so it's not a groundbreaking idea, but this is the first game I've played that makes it the main prop/power. Using it to progress through each scene and puzzle was a fun experience, and I wish there were more excuses to toggle it.\n\nMoving around...oh dear. The animations are fluid and cute, but the timing is sooooo slow. It's not that big of a problem when the distances are short, but if you need to repeatedly run/swim across the entire screen, the wait time is simply too long. It gets absolutely excruciating in the last pipe scene, with jaw-grinding stop-and-go movement that has you clicking the same thing over and over and over just to achieve a single goal that could have easily been reached with 90% less clicks. (Then for all that work, you get no real ending.)\n\nThe puzzles are clever, yet simple enough to figure out with no direction. A bright kid would probably have a blast with them. However in several it's not really clear what the goal is. In more than a few cases I resorted to the help button (something I try to avoid), which highlighted hotspots I never would have guessed without more information. But once you know what you need to do, it's just a matter of completing the steps.\n\nA note for the confusing color puzzles (bells/columns and berries):\nThe idea is to start with a secondary color, then remove the primary color you don't want. The annoying part is that you need to add the color you want to remove. Ex: If it's green and you need yellow, add blue. If you need red, add yellow to orange. And so on. The logic is there (and consistent across puzzles) - it's just poorly implemented.\n\nCONCLUSION\nScore: 4/10\nDon't get me wrong - I did enjoy the game, and was very torn about giving it a thumbs down. But the lack of explanation across the board (story, puzzle goals/solutions, ending, everything) is a huge turnoff. The great aesthetics do soften a few of the cons, but don't expect more satisfaction than a handful of "a-ha!" moments during individual puzzles.\n\nIf you're a patient, laid back, and/or artsy person, I'd say give it a shot, but wait for a bundle or sale. Otherwise there are much more rewarding P&Cs to be found elsewhere.","March 25, 2015","false","2.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I’m a bit reluctant to call it an adventure game as the game itself has little to no story.\nNow the artwork from screen to screen is adorable, beautiful even, the animation is great, however they can become a little bit out-drawn at times. The music on the other hand is simply stunning and ads a lot of mystery and whimsicality to the game.\n\nWhen it comes to the puzzles, I had a hard time figuring out what I was supposed to do every once in a while, but at the same time I liked the challenge of solving them. As you often have to think outside of the box. I particularly liked the use of Lilly’s (or Lilly’s brother’s) goggles.\n\nThe characters don’t have any particular background story, which is a bit disappointing, but it is understandable, when you take into account the time you use to play through the game. Speaking of time. As the game is relatively short, I expected a closed ending at the least, but alas, that did not happen. The choice of ending confused me and made me think: “That’s the ending? That’s it?” The open ending made me think they’re planning a follow-up to this game, but in all honesty, if the next game is the same length as this one, I very much doubt I’ll buy it. The way the ending looked, it seemed that this is just ½ of a whole game. The latter is just speculation on my part though.\n\nIn the end, this is just an experience game made to set a mood and impression. Don’t get me wrong. By describing this is as just an experience game, I want to express that those wanting to play this game, and expect a plot and a story on the same level as the art, animation and sound will most likely be disappointed. Most of the short playtime is made up of puzzles that, once figured out are very easily solved the second time around.  Seeing as it's both short and without a story, all you’re really left with is a short time with a feeling of whimsy that's mostly filled by puzzles made somewhat tedious due to slow animations between motions.\n\nWhen it comes to the price, I think that 9€ is a reasonable price for a game like this. I’ve seen games far worse than this going for a lot more, but I don’t think I’d go as far as paying extra for the “deluxe edition”.\nOverall, I’d say this is a good game. What I’ve enjoyed the most in this game would be the underwater puzzles/ cave puzzle. Again, I really love the art, the music and last, but not least the puzzles plus the use of the goggles in the game. It definitely is worth a play-trough, but that is about it. As much as I’d love to recommend buying this game, I still feel something is lacking before you could actually say that it is a 100% finished product. I’d say the game is entitled to get ½ cookie out of 1 whole cookie :)","April 25, 2014","false","2.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A number of puzzles, particularly the colour puzzles, are very unclear in terms of what one needs to do. Especially when combined with point 1, it makes the game far longer than it should (without the excessive amounts of animation, I think this game would only be ~1.5hrs of gameplay).\n\n4. The story just ends abruptly. It feels as if the game was barely started before it was slapped onto Steam.\n\nAll in all, it may look good (which is more than I can say for May's Mysteries: The Secret of Dragonville), but looking past the eye candy, it's an insufferable experience that will leave you feeling very unsatisfied (and with buyer's remorse).","February 5","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/250030/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Lilly Looking Through is a point n' click game, with a beautiful artstyle, and simple enough mechanics to dodge most of the genre's common problems.\nYou play as Lilly, trying to save your brother, Row. The game ends in a sort of cliffhanger (after 2 hours only), so the plot was very minimal here, and it's a bit of a hard sell for the 10$ they're asking. However, I think the game is competent enough at what it does, even if it doesn't do a lot.\n\n\n\nWithout the shadow of a doubt, the game's highlight is its Presentation. Everything has been hand-drawn and animated, and the result is gorgeous, in my opinion. It's the game that warrants a relaxing playthrough, taking the time to appreciate the backgrounds instead of just solving the puzzles.\n\nEach area is distinct from the others, and has 2 planes (one in the past, one in the present). The present is usually a ruined version of the past's splendour, but both are pretty in their own way.\n\nIf the game was more fluid (I'm not even sure it reached 30fps), it could have been of the quality of a simple tv animation. It's pretty good.\n\nThe music was also very good, although not as striking, I think would be a good way to describe it. It's very soothing, ambience music. A good aspect, though, is how there are 2 tracks: 1 for each plane. The present usually had a more "beaten" sound, with an acoustic guitar, while the past was more majestic and epic, with the use of strings. Of course, this is a gross simplification, but it's enough to give you an idea.\nI went well with the game.\nThe sound effects, on the other hand, were a bit too aggressive, I feel. Not always, but sometimes.\n\nHer\ne are my problems regarding the artstyle and animation:\nThe backgrounds are a bit too blurry (although the problem seemed to disappear after a while -- maybe I got used to it), and the characters had a different style to it, feeling a bit detached. The characters were very clean colored (barely had shadows, for example), while the backgrounds were significantly more complex. It's not horrible, but it didn't feel quite right at the start of the game.\n\nOther than that, the problem is that the animations were a bit too slow, and unskippable. While it is pretty to look at, some puzzles require experimentation, and it takes a bit too long with these stretched animations. The game is only 2 hours long, so I can't say it's a huge problem, but it would certainly be, with more complex puzzles.\n\n\nNow, let's talk about mechanics.\nAs I said, the game is very simple. For instance, there is no inventory, or object carrying. If you every need to use an object, you simply click on it (from the ground), and then click on what you're supposed to. There's no Examine/Give/Use function or anything like that. It's very straightforward, and makes the puzzles self contained.\nIf you're a fan of the point n' click genre, you may not like this. If you're not, then this is probably good!\n\nThe game's main mechanic, is a pair of Goggles. By using them, you see the past plane. It's not a well explored mechanic, but it's used, and it's nicely so. For example, you plant an acorn in the past, and in the future there's a tree. There are other uses, but I think this exemplifies it well enough.\nBut yes, most of the game revolves around this. You change planes to surpass most of the obstacles. There is also a lot of color puzzles in the last few puzzles. The puzzles are generally fairly easy, so there's no need for the game to teach concepts to the player.\n\n\n\nAgain, it is a very simple game. You mostly play it for the imagery, I would imagine. And it's relaxing, if you're into that.\nThere's no plot, no complex puzzles (although they're not achieved at first try, for the most part)... It seems a bit lacking, overall. It's a beautiful game, but it's very limited at what it does.\nSo, be aware of what you're buying. In my opinion, it's a well put experience, for what it is. Perhaps a bit too expensive, but I try to keep that out of the equation.\nI would recommend it if you're interested after reading this, you shouldn't be disappointed, unless you're expecting a decently sized game. It seems more of a prototype than a full game, but for that, it's not bad.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nThere isn't much to take from this, but I'll try to think a bit more about it.\n\nThis is not actually part of the review itself, more of an outside the box analysis, trying to figure out what more there could be (or something that a game simply missed on its mark.\n\nAs I said, there's barely any mechanics to actually learn, or plot to follow. This means that it's almost looking at paintings. Well, almost...\nThere seems to be a huge blank spot waiting to be filled, here. The fact that it's so simple, leaves a lot of space for other content to be presented. When you can simply lay back and appreciate the atmosphere, it has the power to be a bit more than just atmosphere. Carry some ideals, maybe represent an era, something along those lines.\n\nThe point here is that games can sometimes try to build an heavy world and characters that can get overlooked when the player has to learn complex mechanics, or is simply distracted by fast paced combat. It's up to these simpler games to present that rich world, even if just in a very artistic manner, rather than preaching something.\n\nLilly Looking Through doesn't take any advantage of that, but I believe it has the right pacing to do. Thinking outside the gaming industry, movies like Spirited Away, Angel's Egg, Fantastic Planet, The Secret of Kells, Kino's Journey etc. carry a bit of that, in my opinion. It's not about teaching the player about something in particular, but perhaps shed light on things from a different perspective, and provide food for thought in a more artistic way.\n\nThis is me rambling, but I think it's a good exercise, if nothing else. Something useful may occur to me, one of these days, haha!","October 12, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The developers have been busy fixing some issues that are causing lag for some players (it played smoothly on my own system) and will allow long animations to be skipped -- these fixes will make the hoped-for future chapters even better.\n\nThe puzzles are on the simple side for the most part, but with a few where it's hard to figure out what to do at all. Even with the simplicity, I think there are some very creative setups and uses of sound, color, and sequencing that make them very satisfying. However, the use of color could be insurmountable for some players, given the lack of accessibility workarounds. I was able to finish the entire game in a few hours while zonked out with the flu and napping occasionally, as evidence of how the puzzles are more like way-points in an adventure than anything convoluted or fiendish.\n\nThe emotional tone of the game is wonderful, with the mannerisms and expressions of the children making it easy to care about them. The conflict is all about searching, without combat, which is refreshing. All in all it's very enjoyable to play, but I would recommend buying it on sale so you don't feel like you should have gotten a few more hours of gameplay.\n\nPros:\n+ Gorgeous art style, including the movement styles of the animation.\n+ No cumbersome inventory management or hunting for the exact pixel.\n+ Creative use of simple thematic building blocks.\n+ Expressive and emotional without being cloying; it's very pleasing to play.\n\nCons:\n- It's very short; it feels more like an introduction or first chapter than a full game, and it ends on a cliffhanger.\n- Rather obtuse UI can sometimes be frustrating.\n- No accessibility options for color blind players. (And possibly some sound-only puzzles without visual cues? It's been a while since I did those puzzles.)","June 22, 2015","true","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/250030/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Lilly Looking Through is a point n' click game, with a beautiful artstyle, and simple enough mechanics to dodge most of the genre's common problems.\nYou play as Lilly, trying to save your brother, Row. The game ends in a sort of cliffhanger (after 2 hours only), so the plot was very minimal here, and it's a bit of a hard sell for the 10$ they're asking. However, I think the game is competent enough at what it does, even if it doesn't do a lot.\n\n\n\nWithout the shadow of a doubt, the game's highlight is its Presentation. Everything has been hand-drawn and animated, and the result is gorgeous, in my opinion. It's the game that warrants a relaxing playthrough, taking the time to appreciate the backgrounds instead of just solving the puzzles.\n\nEach area is distinct from the others, and has 2 planes (one in the past, one in the present). The present is usually a ruined version of the past's splendour, but both are pretty in their own way.\n\nIf the game was more fluid (I'm not even sure it reached 30fps), it could have been of the quality of a simple tv animation. It's pretty good.\n\nThe music was also very good, although not as striking, I think would be a good way to describe it. It's very soothing, ambience music. A good aspect, though, is how there are 2 tracks: 1 for each plane. The present usually had a more "beaten" sound, with an acoustic guitar, while the past was more majestic and epic, with the use of strings. Of course, this is a gross simplification, but it's enough to give you an idea.\nI went well with the game.\nThe sound effects, on the other hand, were a bit too aggressive, I feel. Not always, but sometimes.\n\nHer\ne are my problems regarding the artstyle and animation:\nThe backgrounds are a bit too blurry (although the problem seemed to disappear after a while -- maybe I got used to it), and the characters had a different style to it, feeling a bit detached. The characters were very clean colored (barely had shadows, for example), while the backgrounds were significantly more complex. It's not horrible, but it didn't feel quite right at the start of the game.\n\nOther than that, the problem is that the animations were a bit too slow, and unskippable. While it is pretty to look at, some puzzles require experimentation, and it takes a bit too long with these stretched animations. The game is only 2 hours long, so I can't say it's a huge problem, but it would certainly be, with more complex puzzles.\n\n\nNow, let's talk about mechanics.\nAs I said, the game is very simple. For instance, there is no inventory, or object carrying. If you every need to use an object, you simply click on it (from the ground), and then click on what you're supposed to. There's no Examine/Give/Use function or anything like that. It's very straightforward, and makes the puzzles self contained.\nIf you're a fan of the point n' click genre, you may not like this. If you're not, then this is probably good!\n\nThe game's main mechanic, is a pair of Goggles. By using them, you see the past plane. It's not a well explored mechanic, but it's used, and it's nicely so. For example, you plant an acorn in the past, and in the future there's a tree. There are other uses, but I think this exemplifies it well enough.\nBut yes, most of the game revolves around this. You change planes to surpass most of the obstacles. There is also a lot of color puzzles in the last few puzzles. The puzzles are generally fairly easy, so there's no need for the game to teach concepts to the player.\n\n\n\nAgain, it is a very simple game. You mostly play it for the imagery, I would imagine. And it's relaxing, if you're into that.\nThere's no plot, no complex puzzles (although they're not achieved at first try, for the most part)... It seems a bit lacking, overall. It's a beautiful game, but it's very limited at what it does.\nSo, be aware of what you're buying. In my opinion, it's a well put experience, for what it is. Perhaps a bit too expensive, but I try to keep that out of the equation.\nI would recommend it if you're interested after reading this, you shouldn't be disappointed, unless you're expecting a decently sized game. It seems more of a prototype than a full game, but for that, it's not bad.\n\n\n--------------\n\n\nThere isn't much to take from this, but I'll try to think a bit more about it.\n\nThis is not actually part of the review itself, more of an outside the box analysis, trying to figure out what more there could be (or something that a game simply missed on its mark.\n\nAs I said, there's barely any mechanics to actually learn, or plot to follow. This means that it's almost looking at paintings. Well, almost...\nThere seems to be a huge blank spot waiting to be filled, here. The fact that it's so simple, leaves a lot of space for other content to be presented. When you can simply lay back and appreciate the atmosphere, it has the power to be a bit more than just atmosphere. Carry some ideals, maybe represent an era, something along those lines.\n\nThe point here is that games can sometimes try to build an heavy world and characters that can get overlooked when the player has to learn complex mechanics, or is simply distracted by fast paced combat. It's up to these simpler games to present that rich world, even if just in a very artistic manner, rather than preaching something.\n\nLilly Looking Through doesn't take any advantage of that, but I believe it has the right pacing to do. Thinking outside the gaming industry, movies like Spirited Away, Angel's Egg, Fantastic Planet, The Secret of Kells, Kino's Journey etc. carry a bit of that, in my opinion. It's not about teaching the player about something in particular, but perhaps shed light on things from a different perspective, and provide food for thought in a more artistic way.\n\nThis is me rambling, but I think it's a good exercise, if nothing else. Something useful may occur to me, one of these days, haha!","October 12, 2014","true","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Nevertheless through books, movies, games and other art forms we can still visit the enchanting worlds of our dreams, carrying ourselves away for a few hours to a place that can only be described as extraordinary.\n\nLily Looking Through is a lovely, imaginative journey that captures that childish awe and spirit of discovery exceptionally well; placing it under an adventure game guise and a gorgeous presentation which carries you on your way sidestepping the many pitfalls games of the genre often fall into. With very little in the way of story Lily is a game that is largely about spectacle over plot, but personally I didn't think it needed anything more than what was here. The simple opening of your brother being taken away by a magic scarf sets off the adventure, and I was more than happy to continue on it without anymore development up until the very end.\n\nThis is the point that I was disappointed with where the developer took the game. Instead of ending with the heartfelt reunion I think many will expect from the start, you are left with something that feels entirely misplaced among the rest of the game which makes no sense and left me feeling a bit empty inside, almost as if the developers themselves had no clue what it was intended to mean. I'm perfectly fine with having to decipher an ending for myself, but when it comes so out of left field as it does here, I have to wonder if it was intended for any reason than to confuse the player.\n\nWhile I disliked the conclusion, the joy I had traversing the rest of the game certainly made up for it. Lily is about as simple an expression of the point and click adventure game formula, but it works wonderfully in this instance. Instead of collecting items, talking to characters, or solving obtuse puzzles, in Lily you simply progress and explore the world. Puzzles come in the form of interacting with objects, pulling levers, and using Lily's goggles to see the world in a new light, all of which formed logical and satisfying solutions which were enjoyable to solve but didn't exasperate me by being too challenging. While I wouldn't call it easy per say, this isn't a game that should give many people trouble, which I feel is admirable in a genre that is so full of alienating game design. If you are looking to flex your cortex intellect this may not be the best way to do so, but as a mellow and relaxing experience Lily succeeds beyond doubt.\n\nEasily Lily's biggest asset is it's artwork. Each vibrant scene is full of lush colors and beautiful detail, mixing pseudo-3D character models with hand-drawn 2D backgrounds. Seeing the environments come to life is a sight to behold, and the top notch animation flows with impeccable grace and fluidity. If the interaction was removed this could easily pass as an animated movie, something I don't say likely and intend as a great compliment taking into account the great strides animation has made in the last few years.\n\nMy only "complaint" if I have one, is that everything moves at a very slow pace. Doing anything traps you in an animation that you then must watch to completion before being able to interact with anything again. This isn't a huge deal for the most part, but when you are at times required to repeat the same task several times in a row it can become a bit frustrating that there is no way to speed up or skip through an animation. I got used to it after playing for a bit, but it wouldn't have hurt if the world moved just a little bit faster.\n\nClocking in at about 2 hours, Lily Looking Through is a decidedly brief experience but one worth having. I loved every second of being in Lily's world, from the amazing art to the delightful puzzles, right up to the regrettably unsatisfying end. While its simple nature may put off some, it was a pleasantly mellow surprise for me and one I would wholeheartedly recommend for anyone looking for a pleasant game to relax with.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 2, 2014","true","2.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cinetyk/recommended/250030/","Cinetyk","Cinetyk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cinetyk/","179 products in account",""Lilly Looking Through" is an adventure/puzzle game in a somewhat minimalistic approach, with a very relaxing and heart warming atmosphere. The presentation of the game is nothing short of magical. The art is beautiful, the music is dreamy and ethereal, and the characters' animations are most exquisite. The kids, Lilly and Row are so cute and animate so well that right from the start it was unbelievably endearing. The game immersed me in a feeling of childhood, with all that innocence, curiosity, cuteness and sense of awe and adventure, like I never have experienced before.\n\nSpeaking of the actual gameplay, it plays like a point and click puzzle adventure where one needs to figure out how to get past the obstacles of each screen to progress to the next. I can't spoil you, so I'll just say that along the way you pick up an item that not only serves as an excellent, original and creative device for the puzzling itself, but adds to the wonder and magic of the game and its world as well. Some of the puzzles are quite hard to figure out, but the hint system, which highlights items/actions you can click makes sure you're not missing out on where you can click, so you can focus on the puzzles themselves. If you have no patience for this genre (or in general), though, or you can't stand low tempo, relaxed games, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nDespite all that I loved about the game, which was, in a nutshell, that it provided me with a nostalgic reliving of the magical feelings of childhood, the game has some problems. Mainly, it's short, around 2-3 hours long, which is a pity and a little frustrating. Towards the end, the puzzles get a bit repetitive in "theme", and their mechanics get a bit more cryptic, thought one can argue that's the point of a puzzle game. But more importantly, and again, without spoiling, the end has little closure and feels more like a cliffhanger than an actual resolution it's surprisingly abrupt and open. Also, it creates the idea that there will be a "sequel"/continuation, one feels that there should be, that the game/story isn't quite finished.\n\nIt pains me to give such criticisms to this game, because, in spite of its failings, the it is so magical and endearing that I was really impressed. It was one the most memorable gaming experiences I ever had. I really hope that there will be more and longer "Lilly" in the future.","April 17, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is short, but what there is of it is both beautiful and interesting. The whole game is charming.\n\nUnlike many point-and-click puzzle games, this does away with the concept of inventory and is much better for it. No trying all combinations of items, everything you need to solve the puzzle is there on the screen. This results in a focus on timing/ordering type puzzles, but there's still a lot of variety. The time-switch mechanic works well too.\n\nI'd definitely recommend this to fans of puzzle games.","July 12, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire thing is whimsically beautiful and a great calming experience to immerse yourself in. Some of the puzzles are a bit frustrating, not in that they're too difficult, but ocassionally very vague- which in itself wouldn't be a problem (I mean experimenting is half the fun) if it weren't for the fact the animation actions are quite long and after several tries, I found myself being distracted from the beauty of the game with frustration.\n\nMy biggest gripe is that this game is so short. With just ten levels, even a puzzle game novice like me can whiz through it in a few hours and I was left wanting more- especially with the story ending like that. At £6.99 this felt more like a first chapter in a several parter and I'm desperate to continue Lilly and Row's adventure.\n\nI wouldn't be so bothered by this if the game itself weren't so utterly gorgeous and pleasant to play.

Given the small budget the developers got from the Kickstarter project, I still think it is a success and I'm happy to have contributed to it as a backer.\n\nThe user-interface could use a little improvements here and there (to improve immersion and make interaction smoother), but the existing system is already solid and doesn't get in the way.\n\nOn a more global note, I personally think the puzzles could have used a better transition between "simple" ones to more complex ones. And, regarding the "complex" ones, provide enough information (through small animations in the environment) regarding colour combinations (not really a spoiler, as almost all puzzle game got these). A puzzle based on sound/resonance would have worked better (in my opinion).\n\nBasically, for a 33k Kickstarter, it's a great game.

Control over the character's position isn't allowed as movement only happens when interacting with objects, at which point the character will move by herself.  There's also panning and zooming which are done by dragging the mouse and double clicking, both similar to dragging and double tapping with the finger.  The tablet-like interaction isn't a detraction though, just an observation.\n\nOverall it's an interesting game, but a couple of parts feels a bit off.  The minor one was the lighting inconsistencies.   When moving from a bright lit area to a darker place, the lighting on the ground and background would be different but the character would continue to have the same brightness on her.  This sometimes makes Lilly stand out in the environment more than I expected.  Maybe it's a stylistic choice and maybe it's a bit of nitpicking, but it was one of the first things I noticed.\n\nThe more major concern was the puzzles near the end where the method to reaching the goal of each scene and the reasons for doing the puzzles becomes more obscure.  Combine it with the trial and error method to discover what the puzzles are and the nice but long character animations, the later puzzles become more of a hassle.\n\nFor example, in one scene a bird steals her goggles and perches on top of a structure.  My first thought was to get it back and there was a mechanism nearby to fiddle around with which turned out to have an effect on the structure it's sitting on along with the nearby ones.  Maybe there was a way that I can scare the bird into dropping it if I played around with it.  I spent quite a while toying with it, watching her bounce back and forth between her idling position to her action movements.  Each trial was long to watch, and since I didn't know if this was the correct path, I could only try out the different combinations to see if there were any effects.  As it turns out the solution was to do something else and I only realized that after exhausting the possible combinations, but the mechanism was still needed to get to the next room, so I'm back again adjusting parameters and watching more animations.\n\nThe next few puzzles (except for one) after that are more or less the same style, a couple even worse.  For example, there's a mechanism that's clearly to be used to solve a puzzle but the puzzle and the desired solution is unknown.  It would be as if a stranger handed you a pen and blank paper and looked at you.  You know he wants you to do something but because he hasn't said or done anything, you're not sure what it is.  So you're left writing and drawing various things and looking at his reactions before you finally realize what he wants.  Maybe if it was clearer what the puzzles are and what was wanted out of each of them prior to interacting with the mechanisms that dealt with them I wouldn't feel as puffed about it but I felt these issues detracted from the magic the game presents.\n\nI would recommend the game on the note that unless you're able to immediately determine what needs to be done to solve the puzzles, you'll most likely be fiddiling around with various combinations while watching Lilly slowly move about.","December 9, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cinetyk/recommended/250030/","Cinetyk","Cinetyk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cinetyk/","179 products in account",""Lilly Looking Through" is an adventure/puzzle game in a somewhat minimalistic approach, with a very relaxing and heart warming atmosphere. The presentation of the game is nothing short of magical. The art is beautiful, the music is dreamy and ethereal, and the characters' animations are most exquisite. The kids, Lilly and Row are so cute and animate so well that right from the start it was unbelievably endearing. The game immersed me in a feeling of childhood, with all that innocence, curiosity, cuteness and sense of awe and adventure, like I never have experienced before.\n\nSpeaking of the actual gameplay, it plays like a point and click puzzle adventure where one needs to figure out how to get past the obstacles of each screen to progress to the next. I can't spoil you, so I'll just say that along the way you pick up an item that not only serves as an excellent, original and creative device for the puzzling itself, but adds to the wonder and magic of the game and its world as well. Some of the puzzles are quite hard to figure out, but the hint system, which highlights items/actions you can click makes sure you're not missing out on where you can click, so you can focus on the puzzles themselves. If you have no patience for this genre (or in general), though, or you can't stand low tempo, relaxed games, I wouldn't recommend it.\n\nDespite all that I loved about the game, which was, in a nutshell, that it provided me with a nostalgic reliving of the magical feelings of childhood, the game has some problems. Mainly, it's short, around 2-3 hours long, which is a pity and a little frustrating. Towards the end, the puzzles get a bit repetitive in "theme", and their mechanics get a bit more cryptic, thought one can argue that's the point of a puzzle game. But more importantly, and again, without spoiling, the end has little closure and feels more like a cliffhanger than an actual resolution it's surprisingly abrupt and open. Also, it creates the idea that there will be a "sequel"/continuation, one feels that there should be, that the game/story isn't quite finished.\n\nIt pains me to give such criticisms to this game, because, in spite of its failings, the it is so magical and endearing that I was really impressed. It was one the most memorable gaming experiences I ever had. I really hope that there will be more and longer "Lilly" in the future.","April 17, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As it's been over two years since the first came out, and without even a hint of anything going on over at Geeta Games, you can safely assume what you see is what you'll probably get, and it's frankly debatable if it was worth it or not. A game that practically demands Steam to put a "Maybe" button for reviews.\n\nAt max, LLT is about 3 hours long. It's a cute game for sure, and it has a wonderful little art style to blend the world together, and a nice gimmick that echoes of childhood stories and dreams. The puzzles make use of this dual perspecive and offer an organic feel that few point and clicks achieve. While none of them hit that sweet spot of puzzle solving, they do present a fair challenge near the end, although it often comes down to trial and error.\n\nThe story mirrors the childlike persona, and with a wordless presentation of the story, it holds a youthful feeling of adventure as you see the old and new. There's an extremely small twist in the story, but other than that, it's very run of the mill, although its heart is in the right place.\n\nWhere it gets rocky is when even if you struggle every step of the way, you have a game that is barely 4 hours long and no satisfaction to show for it. For 10 dollars, that's a debatable price. If this were pitched as an episodic series, maybe. If this were a finished product, and it had an actual ending, I'd say go for it. However, as a game that was clearly pushed out the door with no resolution and probably will never recieve any, don't waste your money. It's a great unfinished product, but for something that may never be concluded, it may be worth steering clear of until a sale or a bundle.\n\nThe only thing worse than wasted potential is seeing potential half-fulfilled.

The art is well drawn. The music is also well composed and pretty. Very atomospheric and calming. That is the good part of this game.\n\nNow for the bad part.\n\nFirstly, the puzzles are not very fun. Some of them, especially the color matching ones are not very intuitive. The fact that you have to watch her move each crank or lever just to test and experiment with what each crank does make it worse. Half of the puzzles consisted of me reading something else, while waiting for the animation to be over. If you misclick, then it makes it even worse.\n\nSecondly, as mentioned before, don't misclick. It is so easy to misclick in this game. It is made worse when you accidentally zoom in while clicking a lever. Since you are zoomed in, you can't even see what pulling the lever did. It was pretty disorienting.\n\nBoth of these problems wouldn't even be that bad if it wasn't for the fact the game feels incomplete. It ends on a rather abrupt cliffhanger without closure, leaving me more confused than ever. Combined with how short the game is, I really think that this game was released early because the developers overreached and fell short.\n\nOverall, this game is nice, but it is NOT worth 10 bucks. Wait for a very good sale or for it to be in a bundle before buying.

The art is well drawn. The music is also well composed and pretty. Very atomospheric and calming. That is the good part of this game.\n\nNow for the bad part.\n\nFirstly, the puzzles are not very fun. Some of them, especially the color matching ones are not very intuitive. The fact that you have to watch her move each crank or lever just to test and experiment with what each crank does make it worse. Half of the puzzles consisted of me reading something else, while waiting for the animation to be over. If you misclick, then it makes it even worse.\n\nSecondly, as mentioned before, don't misclick. It is so easy to misclick in this game. It is made worse when you accidentally zoom in while clicking a lever. Since you are zoomed in, you can't even see what pulling the lever did. It was pretty disorienting.\n\nBoth of these problems wouldn't even be that bad if it wasn't for the fact the game feels incomplete. It ends on a rather abrupt cliffhanger without closure, leaving me more confused than ever. Combined with how short the game is, I really think that this game was released early because the developers overreached and fell short.\n\nOverall, this game is nice, but it is NOT worth 10 bucks. Wait for a very good sale or for it to be in a bundle before buying. Too short for the game to be worth it otherwise, unless you really like point and clicks.","October 8, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As it's been over two years since the first came out, and without even a hint of anything going on over at Geeta Games, you can safely assume what you see is what you'll probably get, and it's frankly debatable if it was worth it or not. A game that practically demands Steam to put a "Maybe" button for reviews.\n\nAt max, LLT is about 3 hours long. It's a cute game for sure, and it has a wonderful little art style to blend the world together, and a nice gimmick that echoes of childhood stories and dreams. The puzzles make use of this dual perspecive and offer an organic feel that few point and clicks achieve. While none of them hit that sweet spot of puzzle solving, they do present a fair challenge near the end, although it often comes down to trial and error.\n\nThe story mirrors the childlike persona, and with a wordless presentation of the story, it holds a youthful feeling of adventure as you see the old and new. There's an extremely small twist in the story, but other than that, it's very run of the mill, although its heart is in the right place.\n\nWhere it gets rocky is when even if you struggle every step of the way, you have a game that is barely 4 hours long and no satisfaction to show for it. For 10 dollars, that's a debatable price. If this were pitched as an episodic series, maybe. If this were a finished product, and it had an actual ending, I'd say go for it. However, as a game that was clearly pushed out the door with no resolution and probably will never recieve any, don't waste your money. It's a great unfinished product, but for something that may never be concluded, it may be worth steering clear of until a sale or a bundle.\n\nThe only thing worse than wasted potential is seeing potential half-fulfilled. God it makes me bitter.","October 5, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most areas come with a past and present layout, and as such changes in the past change the future. A few things to keep in mind:\naround 2 hours of gameplay, so I wouldn't recommend it at full price. This game has cards, but with the steam refund system, you'll likely see the first drop at the end of the game. Most puzzles are straightforward, but a few require a bit of trial and error to first solve. This is especially true for the color puzzles near the end. The game is very linear, you're pretty much guided from one puzzle to the next.A lot of language support, along with handholding, this looks very much like a childrens game.\n","September 13, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good little thing, was hoping for a bit more.\n\nThis is really charming - graphics, animations, music are all really good. What's wrong here is flow.. Took me 1h45 to to it all, but I'm left with the feeling over half of that was waiting for animations to be done.. Everything could and should have been more tight to proceed at a much snappier pace. During the last few screens, I was literally watching TV after a click waiting for the characters to waaaalk over.. do their thing.. and finally pass the control back to me while I was trying to figure out what it was I was supposed to do with the colored bells..\n\nMechanically it goes from pretty much a tutorial level where I was wondering if this was an interactive story where you just press the only possible thing to make things progress, to an ok adventure game a la Botanicula (ie no inventory) to the last few screens where there's more interlinked elements to the puzzles (where the pacing issue shows it's annoying head as mentionned before).\n\nThe 'gimmick' of using the goggles to time travel to an ancient version of the screen where changes can affect the present (ie plant an acorn in the past, get a tree in the present) is neat, so I was really surprised to see the game ditch it altogheter just before getting to the end game...!\n\nI feel there are fuller, more polished games out there from more experienced teams for the same price point. The story is really thin.. Really, if not for the really great graphics and animations plus the overall charm, it might have been a serious thumbs down.","February 28","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A short adventure with puzzles over 10 "scenes".  I enjoyed the art style, music and feel of the game for the first half or so.  Puzzles aren't too difficult but felt a bit random at times (lots of trial and error button pushing).  By the end, it was feeling a bit old to have to watch the same little, slow animation as your character goes back and forth multiple times until you've figured out what you need to do and then how to actual do it.  For me, it got very tedious near the end and I almost didn't bother finishing the game.  I think if there had been any more scenes, I would have stopped without finishing as I just couldn't take the repetition.  Overall, I enjoyed about 3/4s of this game, so I'll go ahead and give it a thumbs up....mainly because I liked the overall look of the game.  Will not be playing again however.","April 4","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art looked nice and the gameplay idea behind it were simple and minimalistic. The story was short and left a lot to the player's imagination.\nThe music was in touch with each scene, and there was some short voice acting.\n\nAn issue I had with this was the slowness at which everything moved. This was especially fustrating when taking the wrong direction in a puzzle, or misclicking an action. A great feature that other P&Click adventures have is where you can doubleclick to force the animation to complete earlier.\n\nOverall, for an indie game, 7/10.

Some of the puzzles can be pretty tricky (especially the ones that involve adding and subtracting color, which can also be a dealbreaker for people with color blindness), but solving them is really satisfying.\n\nLastly, the game is rather short. If you have a look at the scene browser screen as you start progressing through the game you'll quickly get a sense of how much you have left. Personally, I finished in just under 2 hours.\n\nIt doesn't really have any particular replay value, unless you simply want to do the puzzles again or revisit the vistas, but it was an enjoyable little experience.","August 21, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
