Both of you need to restart the game each time if you want to rematch. Otherwise the game will stuck on "starting" or "loading", or you will get empty black box on opponent's space.\n*You can change to windowed mode by pressing Alt+Enter.\n*If you liked songs or BGMs of the game, you can find it on Data/Sound_Default foulder with "BG_~" names.\n\nThe game rule is really simple.\nYou can remove a block by clicking it, and you need to make a big (2x2) block in order to get points or attack to your opponent. Also, you can rotate the board to change a direction blocks move.\nOn earlier stages or easy difficulty you can enjoy the game at your own pace. But as you continue the game, you will be required to search for a best block to remove as fast as you can. Both of clicking speed and perfect combo.\n\nThere are 4 modes. Puzzle, Battle, Push, IQ.\nPuzzle is a stage clearing mode that contains 50 stages. You need to do some certain things like "XXXX points within XX seconds" or "XX combos within XX seconds". Each stage has unique board that will give you challange and fun.\n\nBattle and Push modes are play against AI with different way. It's better to see the trailer how those modes are different.\nAbove normal or hard difficulty, AIs are really tough. So I'm sure you won't be bored by easy and liner AI.\n\nIQ mode is a classic puzzle. There are pre-made boards that need correct solution to remove all blocks.\nIf you are looking for a puzzle game that can be played without any hurry, probably this mode is best for you. Other modes have time limit or opponent.\n\nAt the beginning of this game, you only have Puzzle mode to select. You need to unlock other modes or skins by collecting "CUBE"s.\nCUBEs are gained by beating the stage or AI, so if you want to unlock another mode or difficulty, you have to play well. I think this is nice motivation to play, at least it won't disturb or annoy you from playing the game.\n\nGraphics&Sounds are cute, that makes you to feel relax while playing.\n\nSince Clickr has some bug on multiplayer and difficulty is not acceptable for everyone, I think this game won't be a best choice from all of the puzzle games.\nBut forusing on singleplayer and bit hard difficuly, cute looking, this is a nice puzzle game that is able to spend 10+ hours.\nAlso, the dev decreased price to half ($5 from $10) later 2013, and included it in a indie bundle and added trading cards now, so you can expect some newcomers.\n\nIf you are looking for some puzzle game that is different from old-fashioned style and tough enough to annoy you, I think this game is worth the price.","January 24, 2014","true","20.3"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","38","46","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kzwen/recommended/45500/","kzwen","kzwen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kzwen/","2201 products in account",""Not your usual match3."\nIn this game, you match 4 small blocks into 1 big block which can then be linked to other same colored small blocks. Constantly popping the blocks net you a combo bonus. However, instead of just matching elements, you can turn the board around to create big blocks. Clockwise or anticlockwise - it's all up to you. In doing so, you can achieve Magic Turn.\n\nYou can see from the screenshots, there are red, blue and green blocks. There's also star and stone blocks. Star blocks act like a wild card. Popping it beside any normal block will turn it into the same color. Forming a big star block and popping it will clear the whole board - useful in sticky situations. Stone blocks are basically obstacles. You can only get rid of them if you form a big stone block and pop it. That will clear the whole board of stone blocks - but the reprieve is short.\n\n"Clickr is many games in one."\nThere are four different modes: Puzzle, Battle, Push, and IQ. Each of them has different sub-modes as shown below:-\nPUZZLE: Stage, Combo, Point\nBATTLE/PUSH: Easy, Normal, Hard, Extreme, Geekplay, Self\nIQ: Easy, Normal, Hard\n\nFor stage mode, there are 50 levels. Fifty set tricky levels that will take a lot of head-scratching to clear them all. More so if you are aiming for no. 1 clears. Combo and Point modes are like their names, you aim to get the most number of combos and the highest points with a random board.\n\nBattle and Push modes are also available to play via multiplayer*. For the single player mode, you play them versus the AI.\nIn a twist, for Battle mode, the blocks you pop become your minions which you then send out to "battle". If your opponent's minions reaches your home base, you get damage and when you reach zero hp, you lose. Big star blocks here will cause all your opponents minions to fall on the battleground. Big stone blocks will turn into mines which will eat up the first opponent minion that dare step on it.\nFor Push mode, the idea is simpler. Each of you has to try your hardest (and fastest) to cause the blocks in the middle to fall on your opponent's side.  Constantly popping red blocks for example, will push the red block out towards your opponent. Stone blocks are use to 'hold' the block in place - very useful when you are in danger.\nThe self modes of each, are basically you playing against a 'ghost' of yourself. Ie. your previous runs. Geekplay is particularly horrifying and shows how sadistic the devs are. They are almost impossible to beat unless you are a pro at this game.\n\nLastly, IQ mode. Basically awesome enough to standalone by itself as a game. The levels are set and your aim is to pop every single block on the board.\n\nThe conclusion is this is one epic game. It is casual enough for those 5 minutes play sessions and also challenging enough that you will get hooked for hours trying to beat that mode and still not beat it. Not everyone will love all the modes - I for one particularly dislike Push mode but you will definitely find something to like - IQ mode for me.\n\n*Multiplayer mode is buggy. Has been since the start and will likely always be. It does work...with some patience. Rematching (or playing two matches in a row) is known to NOT work until both players restart the game entirely.","April 28, 2014","true","50.5"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","4"

There seems to be a reasonable amount of content in the way of puzzle levels, battle/push difficulties, skins (changes the visual/sound theme of the game) and some other mode that I can't be bothered to unlock (it requires a combo of 50 from the puzzle mode -but I'm stuck on a level where I need a combo of 30...I GOT 29 ONCE >:{ ).\n\nDon't let the Casual category per Steam confuse you, I can only see core puzzle enthusiasts being able to finish this game - there are a lot of puzzle games I love, but I don't ever see myself ever beating some of these infuriating puzzles or too-fast-for-me-to-compensate battles.\n\nThere is NO multiplayer community. No players online. Unless you stumble into a room when somebody else makes a game, there will be no players online, which is unfortunate since it appears the developer went out of its way to have online mods and searchable lobbies when it could have just went the local multiplayer route (or no MP at all). You will have to find friends to play this. I can imagine the game being fun in battle or push mode, but I barely won normal mode, so I can't see myself being remotely competitive (there are at least three more difficulties.)\n\nI am still in search of the "Modern Sega Swirl". While the Puzzle Quest series is great, and Legend of Fae was almost good, Clickr fails to fill in the "Sega Swirl" void I was looking for. If you like challenging puzzles and the idea of probably restarting a level multiple times until you find the right sequence you're supposed to click blocks, then you may enjoy this, especially if you like the "kawaii" South Korean/Japanese influence. I'd urge everybody else to avoid unless a good video review has convinced you otherwise.","January 19, 2014","false","2.0"," 47 of 73 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","47","73","0","4"

However, while these issues are evident consistently throughout the experience, the strong range and execution of gameplay elements makes these problems excusable at worst.\n\nAs the player begins, only a match-4/puzzle hybrid mode will be available, which lists an objective and a time in which it must be completed. There are fifty stages available, with new elements being gradually introduced. All the objectives fall under the same few categories, which allows you to to familiarise yourself with the concepts. Repetition does become a problem; only the rising difficulty stops this mode from becoming stale too quickly.\n\nThe gameplay takes place on a square board. The space inside is occupied by squares of different colours. In order to score points, players must get four pieces of the same colour together to form one big square before clearing it. Clearing this square will also clear any linked blocks of the same colour. There are also star blocks and stone blocks, both of which serve a unique purpose and add a bit of depth to the title.\n\nUpon completing a challenge, players are rewarded with ‘cubes’ - the currency in Clickr. If a player amasses enough cubes, they can unlock new game modes - Battle, Push and IQ. Battle plots players against AI, in what can only be described as tower defense-like gameplay controlled by the game board. Push has players try to continuously clear the same-coloured blocks in order to push them onto their opponent. Finally, IQ contains set puzzles where players must clear the game board as quickly as possible. ’Skins’ can also be purchased, which completely change the audio and cosmetic make up of the game.\n\nIn all game modes, records are saved and some stats can also be seen on the Steam leaderboards. To complete the repertoire offered by Clickr, both the Battle and Push game modes are playable online against other people, with win/loss records being saved. The collection of data is a good way to demonstrate a player’s improvement in the game, and also serves as motivation for you to keep replaying the same level before progressing.\n\nThe presentation, sadly, is hit and miss. The graphics do well no matter which skin you’ve chosen, with minimalistic visuals on the game board making play easy, while images elsewhere spark things up a little. The soundtrack is decent enough within each skin, however the sounds, especially the voice-overs, are hideous. Thankfully, they can be turned down, or even off, so it’s not an inescapable issue.\n\nOther issues with the game include the typos which branch from localisation, the loading times, which are strangely long on occasion, and the frustratingly slow rate at which cubes (money) can be earned, despite the high asking price of some of the unlockable content. In this type of game, it’s unusual to need to spend more than a few hours unlocking everything, and this may deter new players.\n\nAnother issue one might have with the game is that very few of the records saved are on the Steam leaderboards. While totals like overall score are collected, times for individual IQ levels and Puzzle Mode levels are not, taking away some of the competitive edge that often drives these types of games.\n\nIn the scheme of things, however, this is a non-issue, with the versatility of Clickr doing much more to help the game than any of the listed detriments does to hurt it. If you’re a puzzle gamer or even just a casual gamer who likes to play a bit of Bejeweled, give this one a look, as all the elements come together here to create a unique and, more importantly, worthwhile experience.\n\nClickr combines the best of match-4 gaming with some intriguing puzzle-based twists, offering a fun experience to a wide demographic. The adjustable graphics are a bit of fun, and though the hideous sound effects tell of a childish, cutesy game, Clickr is anything but, and is a game everybody should at least try.","November 14, 2015","true","13.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

Ltd. and published by Zero Rock Entertainment in December 2010 for Windows.\n\nClick, turn, match - repeat. In this way or a similar way can the gameplay be decribed. The task has been to match four or more squares together and get rid of them by clicking on the biggest square. During this, the player has to rotate the board on which the squares are located, so that they fall down - if space is available. With a bit of luck the right colour matches with the other equal coloured blocks and a new big square accrues; speaking of which, luck is something the player needs a lot of in Clickr! While the first levels are manageable in time and amount of squares, the later levels only depend on luck how squares in special colour occure. A star between blocks can be changed into another block of a colour that is in close range. Besides this, grey blocks join the party and interrupt the possibility to match colours together. However, they can be matched as well to get rid of them.\nAs if this would not be a problem already in later levels, so is the time limit. Later levels demand higher score points in a incredible less amount of time, so that Clickr! degenerates in something the name already mentions: A fast-paced clicker game, based on luck and without a strategy to think about.\nWith time and patience the player can unlock a battlemode, in which two huge monsters stand against each other and generate little minions based on the amount of matched blocks. Clickr! also includes a multiplayer, which is, unfortunately, dead.\n\nGraphics are hold very colourful and blocks appear in 3 different colours, red - green and blue. The mouse courser changes into an animated glove with a streched pointer. Monsters in different modes look adorable and the overall appearance does not take itself very serious. For some maybe too cute, for some the right atmosphere for games like this, Clickr! is not too fussy and can be nice to look at during the playtime.\nMentionable is the option to purchase Skins with ingame currency, which completely change the appearance of the game.\n\nIf it comes to the sound it gets clear very fast, that it is absolutely made for Clickr! A cute, cheerful loop of the sound from xylophones, keyboard and such accompany the player and sometimes a soft voice turns in to cheer the player. After half an hour of playtime it can get repetitive and also very annoying, especially in the push mode, where children sing a rhythmic "lalala" to the actual music. At this point the option to turn off the sound is more helpful than ever.\n\nThe whole game uses the mouse controlwise. While the main button is the left mousebutton to click around, the mouse wheel turns the board to let blocks fall. Easy to learn and also easy to master, Clickr! does not demand to study the controls for more than a minute.\n\nDown the road, sometimes frustrating - sometimes rewarding, Clickr! can be fun for an amount of time. The gameplay is easy to learn and controls do not need a lot of attention, so the player can relax while listen to his own music. Yet, it can get very repetitive after some time and later levels are so hard to beat due to the less time limit and high score points, that the player does not dare to continue it further.\n\nFor true fans of clicker games and those who just want to relaxe their mind, Clickr! can be recommended. Everyone else who is still unsure should absolutely wait for a sale or even a bundle sale.\n\nRecommended when on sale or in a bundle.\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ RÉSUMÉ]▬▬▬▬●\nAfter only 1,8 hours on record I have to say, that this game is nothing I would continue to play further. It is way too much based on luck that I don't pay it more attention than I have to. Yet, the review is positive thanks to the fact, that the game is very easy to learn and can hold a lot of fun for 30 minutes per day or week (when listening to your own music list).\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ TL;DR]▬▬▬▬●\n[✔] Colourful and minimalistic graphics\n[✔] Easy gameplay mechanics and controls\n[✔] Different game modes\n\n[✖] Late levels are frustratingly hard to beat and based only on luck\n[✖] For some layout and music way too cute (after a while also annoying)\n[✖] Multiplayer dead\n\n●▬▬▬▬▬[➤ MEDIA]▬▬▬▬▬●\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTEkI7Hc0Xo\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you liked this review and want to see more from me, give this review a thumbs up!

You have to predict the spots where the blocks could gather into 4-squares and chain-connect to bring you more points, clicking on stray blocks just allows you to empty space for the upper ones to fall. The tasks use timer and you have to be a really quick clicker too & if you miss a square you'll sometimes spoil yourself a combo.\n\nThe main problem is that the incoming colors are random & the success largely depends on luck, so that you might need to replay a task like 100+ times to pass through. Those little girl's cheerful voice samples that seem adorable at first become a torture to your nervous system in a while. So I can't recomment it to a normal player, only hardcore puzzle gamblers will find satisfaction here.\n\n****\nДанная игра, будучи основана на интересной комбинации идей (Тетрис+3 в ряд+Щелкалка) и приятно сделана, требует цепкого восприятия геометрии на игровом поле, быстрой реакции и точности (в последнем отношении она напомнила мне Сапера: выбор правильных клеток из большого массива).\n\nИгровое поле вращается по требованию, так что можно выбирать направление падения блоков, и вам необходимо как бы наблюдать доску одновременно со всех сторон, чтобы играть эффективно. Следует предвидеть места, в которых квадратики могут собраться в большие квадраты по 4 и соединиться в цепи, принося больше очков, а щелкая по отдельным клеткам мы лишь освобождаем пространство для падения верхних блоков. Задания на время, так что необходимо также очень быстро щелкать, а вот если разок промахнетесь, можете испортить себе всю комбинацию.\n\nОсновная проблема в том, что вновь образующиеся цвета случайны, и успех в большой степени зависит от удачи, так иногда приходится переигрывать задание по 100 с лишним раз пока не свезет. А эти звуковые эффекты с радостным голосом девочки, поначалу милые, становятся со временем настоящей пыткой для нервов. В общем, я не могу рекомендовать игру нормальному игроку, лишь самые азартные головоломочные профи найдут здесь удовлетворение.","November 30, 2015","false","6.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Surprisingly tricky, and with a multitude of ways to play, Clickr is a bargain for those who enjoy puzzle games.\n\nClickr belongs to the "connecting squares of the same colour to form bigger squares" genre, but gives it an interesting spin (literally) by incorporating 90 degree rotations of the board. Create a combo via rotating and you'll get a "Magic Turn", which will give you big bonuses... and you'll need them, as you'll need big scores in short amounts of time to advance in Puzzle mode (the first available mode).\n\nIn addition to Puzzle Mode (which also includes other modes in itself), there is also Battle, Push, IQ, and Multiplayer. These are unlocked either by accumulating cubes earned by passing levels or by playing matches, or by getting certain achievements.\n\nBattle and Push are both speed-based action modes. In Battle, monsters are sent to your side of the screen, and by creating combos you send out little monsters of your own to stop them, and attack. In Push, you play against the AI; creating combos of a colour pushes a giant block toward onto your opponents side, if they don't create their own combos of the same colour to push back, it will fall on their side--if enough blocks fall, they lose. Of course, all the while you're pushing blocks on their side, they're pushing blocks on you. Even on Easy, I found both of these modes quite hard!\n\nIQ (my favourite mode) requires you to clear the board without clicking on any non-combo squares. I prefer the slow pace!\n\nI haven't tried the Multiplayer option yet, but I've read in the discussion forum that there is a bug in which you cannot directly rematch an opponent, but have to exit and re-enter the game. That's unfortunate, as judging from my brief experience with the Push mode against the AI, an MP-version would be quite fun.\n\nAs frosting, the art is quite cute and the presentation of menus, UI, etc is simple, but very slick. There are also different skins to unlock.  The music is happy with a retro sort of feel to it; in fact, with its cutesy voices, happy sound effects, and overall look, the general presentation reminds me a bit of Chu Chu Rocket.\n\nClickr may not have the deepest gameplay ever (my spatial judgment is not great, so the game may be harder for me than it would be for others), but it incorporates enough different features in gameplay to make it fresh.  For $5 or less, you get a lot of bang for your buck, and puzzle fans should find a lot to enjoy.","February 3, 2014","true","11.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

It reminds me of Yosumin and Lumines. You have to rotate a square (the size differs depending on the mode) and matching squares to make a 4x4 square out of smaller squares and if any squares are touching a big square of the same color (there's 4 colors), then those wil get cleared in the process as well, hence the more squares you have connected, the more points you score. You have a handful of different modes you can play (3 of them you have to unlock) as well as a multiplayer mode (I have yet to try it out but I'm sure it works). As for the control scheme, you can choose between left and right handed controls but since I'm not left handed this is going to cover the right handed controls. You can use either the e and w keys to rotate the board or the mouse wheel on your mouse/touch pad (I tend to find the e and w keys to be the faster option but to each their own), and you use the left mouse click to select squares. Another thing I'll mention, although its not important, if you click the ufo at the top of the main menu, you can view the opening video again anytime you want to. Not sure how important that info is but I'm sure there's people out there that like watching opening videos more than once. Lastly, there is a noticible difficulty curve so do watch out for that as the game can become overwhelming if you aren't prepared for it to move faster than expected when you go up a difficulty (or it was a little bit overwhelming for me as I was still getting the hang of the game).\n\nAs of this writing, Clickr is currently on sale for .99 during the 2014 steam summer sale, and will be that price until June 30th, so hurry and get this while the price is low.","June 22, 2014","true","2.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

So please enjoy this multi-player review of this colorful new game from NTREEV Soft.\n\nFour main game modes: Puzzle, Battle, Push, and IQ modes\nMultiple sub-modes and missions for various playing preferences\n\nThree sub-modes at Puzzle Mode: Point Challenge, Combo Challenge and Stage Challenge with 50 stages\n16 missions and self-challenge mode at Battle and Push Modes\n200 smart puzzles at IQ Mode\nMulti-play also available: Head-to-head match-ups in Battle and Push Modes\nThree different themes: Each of Basic, Africa and Zombie theme provides different characters, effects, skins and sounds!\nMore than 70 Steam Achievements to unlock\nAdditional Features: Help-video, controls for left-handers, and global leaderboards\n\nAlthough I went feeling a little burned out on casual chain-seeking family games with little more than a new icon set – I really liked Clickr – I was more than half expecting another Bejeweled/Puzzle Quest variation, but instead found something more akin to the new wave of slick tile-based puzzle games like Cipher Prime’s Fractal.\n\nWhen we started playing the multiplayer, I was both confused and distracted by the interface (the little marching characters at the top) but after I had had more time to play the solo campaign, it started to make sense and I couldn’t wait to get back to some more PvP.\n\nSpeaking of which, I love how the solo campaign keeps changing up not only the style and size of the game board, but the nature of the puzzles. Actually, once the the dead blocks and wild cards (stars) started piling up, and I started getting a little further under the hood of the game’s mechanics, I was reminded of real puzzle games like Cogs – a very good thing. I was actually strategizing forward five or six moves. I could never quite beat level 17, but it was fun getting up to that.\n\nIn terms of design and presentation, I got a kick out of the weird, annoying “It’s A Small World”-on-crack music and SFX, the smooth vectors graphics and sugary Harajuku animation. Don’t have much to complain about.","July 20, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It can get quite difficult, but that's why they're puzzles! I'm currently stuck on one level which is driving me crazy, but it's not stopping me from leaving the game yet. It's quite a simple context, in a range of different timers and with a bunch of different goals to achieve before each stage. It's just a little bit of fun, including multiplayer gamemodes and steam trading cards - that's good enough for me! I did have a 66% off voucher on this game, I'm glad I did because I wouldn't have paid more than what I did for it.

"Oh, another puzzle game just like Bejeweled but a different look". Though after playing for about 40 minutes, I was actually shocked with what actually came out from this game. The concept was easy to get into. Click to destroy blocks, 'W' and 'E' to rotate the board. Simple as that. Until the concepts come into play. 4 blocks together gets you 10 points at once. Get one of these with rotating, and you get twice as many points along with the spare blocks near it. This game may be simple at first, but then Clickr throws in a bunch of strategy actually needed to win one of 50 different timed puzzles. With many other modes such as Push and a Battle Mode, Clickr comes with a lot of replay value. This is worth the money for any puzzle master thinking about adding Clickr to their collection.","August 2, 2014","true","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Simple mechanics (make 2x2 squares of blocks, clear them, get points) making up a surprisingly complex game. There are different modes: Puzzle gives you challenges that can be timed or based on getting a certain number of combos. Battle (my personal favorite) has you and an opponent making combos that send monsters to attack the other player's HP. IQ gives you puzzles where you have to clear the screen of blocks. These modes all have multiple difficulty settings, so players of all skill levels can enjoy them. I play most games singleplayer, so I can't comment on the multiplayer experience.

While it might keep you entertained a few minutes at a time, and is arguably worth a dollar to some, "Clickr" has less value than most all Facebook games.\n\nThe whole basis of the game is to click on blocks to get groups of 4 blocks which you then click for points. Once you have enough points you have beaten the level.\n\nI have a hard time even believing it can accurately be described as a game.","January 27, 2014","false","1.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You are punished for doing so, because combos are necessary.\nWhat sort of inhuman precision...? To be fair, though, this game made me question my brain's ability to recognize and associate colors. So I think I'm just teh suck.\n\nBut. The cursor is also teh suck. An oblong shape for one; the block that YOU (thought you) clicked will probably not be the one that the game registers.\n\nLots of cutesy things going on that, in my total ignorance of the, er, media(?), I feel anime fans would enjoy (hence the second sentence of this) - you don't get to see hardly any of it, though, because you're busy clicking.\n\nEvery match is a race against time. There are several modes. Each of them seem to have a different gimmick, but the gameplay is always the same. Regarding those gimmicks - they are usually those cutesy things.\nThere is a mode that has three blocks of the three colors in the center. You're clicking through a puzzle on the right. The computer is also clicking (I don't think you can see its puzzle, you might, but I couldn't see it... because puzzle). Y'all are competing to push the center blocks towards each other by matching blocks.\n\n\nSo yeah. You hardly ever know what's going on, but the point of the game remains the same. Clickr: It's Tetris, but not.\n\n\nBy the way, this is the fifth(?) game I've tagged with "Mobile Port." So that should be a thing (not that it would be necessary for this one - it's totally clear what it is, but I just thought to mention it because)(and to be clear, I've no hatred for mobile ports in general - Bardbarian is pretty cool - I just think it's always good to know).\n\nEDIT: Ahahahahaha Ohhh I forgot. The opening (")cutscene(") describes mobile gaming precisely.\nAlso, if you hit "Exit" and then answer "Are you sure?" with "No," the game happily exclaims "Thank you!"\nThat just soured me on it even more, but I will continue to play it in the hopes that I can figure out wtf.\nAlso, I tried the strategy of "Click all the cubez!!!!!!!!!!!!!" and it didn't work.\nSo.\nUnless there are power-ups or something that I don't know about - that you can buy with in-game currency (I don't THINK there's a cash-shop but I do not know) - (which is possible, because I just now saw in one of the game modes, Battle - which has little representations of the blocks you cleared running atop the screen, assaulting the computer's tower - that you can manually decide when to launch those units) I really do not see how some of these puzzles are remotely possible.\n\n*Headache intensifies*","February 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","33","2","6","4","0"

I completed all 50 of the main levels in around three hours so there's that. I didn't have to use tutorials on anything, but since every level is the same every time, you could possibly use a walkthough if you got stuck somewhere.\n\nAfter the first fifty stages, a battle mode and push mode open up. I've seen these types of stages before on some old Nintendo games and they are a little more entertaining than the puzzle levels. Unfortunately, they cost in-game points to unlock which are a pain to gather up. On the other hand, fun unlockables give the game much more depth outside of its basic puzzle component.\n\nLastly, the music is great but the sound effect voiceovers are annoying. Most of it got mistranslated and you keep hearing YEEEEEEE!!! YEEE!!!!! every time you get a combo and you get A LOT of combos. Luckily, you can turn this repetitive noise off, but I didn't know that at first.\n\nI think this is one of those games that is fun to play on a plane or something without sound for an hour or two. You'll come back to it over and over until you beat those initial levels, but after that there's not much will to continue.\n\nRating: 5.5/10\nRecommended Price: $3","February 13","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I completed all 50 of the main levels in around three hours so there's that. I didn't have to use tutorials on anything, but since every level is the same every time, you could possibly use a walkthough if you got stuck somewhere.\n\nAfter the first fifty stages, a battle mode and push mode open up. I've seen these types of stages before on some old Nintendo games and they are a little more entertaining than the puzzle levels. Unfortunately, they cost in-game points to unlock which are a pain to gather up. On the other hand, fun unlockables give the game much more depth outside of its basic puzzle component.\n\nLastly, the music is great but the sound effect voiceovers are annoying. Most of it got mistranslated and you keep hearing YEEEEEEE!!! YEEE!!!!! every time you get a combo and you get A LOT of combos. Luckily, you can turn this repetitive noise off, but I didn't know that at first.\n\nI think this is one of those games that is fun to play on a plane or something without sound for an hour or two. You'll come back to it over and over until you beat those initial levels, but after that there's not much will to continue.\n\nRating: 5.5/10\nRecommended Price: $3","February 13","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
