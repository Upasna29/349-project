I’m sure you’ve seen other reviews saying: “modders have ruined it!” and “online is no fun cos of hackors!”.\n\nWell that’s because it’s true. All of it.\n\nAllow me to put this as realistically as possible.\n\nI have amassed a total of 420 hours on GTAV. Didn’t play the campaign, I had already done that when it first arrived on console. No, these hours are mainly online play. I’ve grinded mission after mission to earn the cash. I’ve spent hours buying, customizing and completing challenges. I now have a profile that has all the levelled unlocks, cars and guns you could ever want, making it a very hard earned profile.\n\nHOWEVER, I have now lost most (if not all) of my desire to switch this game on, and I’m sure you have a pretty good idea of why that is. Nether the less, I shall give you an example of a typical session of online play if you were to enter the game today (which let’s face it, is the main reason why we play it).\n\nEnter my first match. > begin attempt to have fun. > Player arrives on a bike and kills me to death. > very well, I shall retaliate by firing a rocket at his bike. > Rocket hits.  > But wait, the player didn’t die. > Then quickly learn from further attempts and other players that he is using God-mode > I then attempt to use the player menu to ‘vote to kick’ him, as others were attempting to do the same thing  > Turns out he has used a mod that removes his name from the player list, making it impossible to kick him out of the match. > I then call him out for using Mods (with restraint to call him many, many things) > At this point he proceeds to delete my car and spawn 100,000 things on my head, making my game crash to desktop (and probably anyone else who was near-by in game).\n\nNow after lots and lots of match surfing, I can quite confidently state the following with applied calculation and experience:\n\nIf you buy this game for the online side of play, roughly 1 in 3 of your free-roam sessions will be rife with situations similar to this ^.\n\n\nSo to give you an evaluation:\n\nIf you are a normal player –\n\nPrepare to have unfair play, have your things deleted, and get crashed to desktop by modder’s whenever you challenge their actions, because Rockstar will never regulate and control this issue.\n\nIf you are wanting to be a modder –\n\nYou can enjoy being invincible, gank on players then delete everyone’s things, and if they call you out you can just crash everyone, because you are a big man and Rockstar will never regulate or control this issue. Then they’ll write negative reviews, losing the game its popularity to a point where it just becomes garbage. Then you’ll have it all to yourself, and your mission to alienate everyone from online play will be complete.\n\n\nTo quote another game (that I would recommend more tbh):\n\n“Well done Stanley, everyone thinks you’re very powerful.”\n\n\nP.S - The second biggest issue is the micro-transactions, and rockstar's ever vigilant attempt to take in-game money from you in order to force you into buying shark cards with real money. but that needs a whole review in itself to detail that issue (which i really dont have the time in my life for).\n\n\nMy only hope is that enough people will see this review and get it to the bench, so that maybe some people will decide not to ruin this game with bad modder/hacker behaviour.","May 12","false","428.9"," 1,355 of 1,544 people (88%) found this review helpful 125 people found this review funny","88","355","1","125","62"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigantic/recommended/271590/","gigantic","frostey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gigantic/","131 products in account","The negative reviews are mostly complaints about Online and they do make valid points but if you're considering not buying the game because of the reviews about Online please do know that you can create private sessions to play with friends.\n\nThe Main Story // Single Player"When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody, least of all each other."\n\nWhat the main story has to offer:\n+ 69 Unique Missions (actually 79 but they used 69 to make the lame 69 reference) which is around 30 - 40 hours of gameplay\n+ Strangers & Freaks\n+ Heists\n+ Many Easter Eggs and References\n+ Amazingly directed\n+ Humorous and amusing\n+ Great voice-acting\n+ Trevor Philips\n\nGameplay (Single-Player and Online)The Gameplay has greatly improved from the past games, adding some nice new features but sadly also removing some nice features.\n+ A beautiful, immersive open world to explore.\n+ A much less complicated driving system compared to GTA 4's\n+ Optional First Person View you can use for a whole new experience\n+ Nice Vehicle Customization\n+ Great Character Customization\n+ Realistic character movement\n+ Great Physics\n- They completely removed Euphoria\n- Lack of interior\n+ A vast range of activities you can do in the game\n+ Many vehicles and weapons\n- Lack of fighting styles.\n+ You can talk to pedestrians and cops (Single-Player)\n- The missions aren't really that hard\n- Rude cops\n- Crappy AI, most of them just walk away or even call the cops on you for standing next to them or staring at them\n- You can't really shape your Online character\n+ Strip Club in which you can look at uncensored female nipples\n+ Cool Transition when you switch characters (Single-Player)\n+ Plug-and-Play controller support. You can literally plug your controller in and instantly play the game with it.\n\nGraphics and Performance+ Great Graphics\n+ Supports 4K resolution in 60 fps\n+ I wasn't really expecting my PC to run this game well as it's a next generation game but suprisingly enough, it did.\n- A few graphical errors\n- Misleading Minimum Requirements, you need atleast 6 GB of RAM in order to make sure that this game runs smoothly\n\nOnlineOnline is basically the multiplayer mode of GTA V and is also the reason why most people are buying the game though if you're planning to play the game only for its Online mode you should really consider playing Single Player too.\n\n+ It's fun messing around with people in free roam\n+ 4 game modes: Missions, Heists, Versus, Races and Adversary Modes (excluding Freemode events and VIP Work since they're both in free roam)\n- Repetitive missions\n+ Adversary Modes has a variety of different PvP modes which are all enjoyable\n- It's full of Hackers who ruin the game. They strip your weapons, money and kill you. There are some nice hackers out there who give you free money but where's the fun in that?\n- Online servers occasionally go on maintainence but I'm fine with it.\n-Long ♥♥♥ loading time compared to Single Player. I usually go to Single Player first and switch to Online after.\n\nIn Conclusion The game is a fantastic game but it does not live up to its name. It's called Grand Theft Auto but most missions do not involve stealing cars and there's also a chance of getting a bounty on your head for stealing cars off NPC's Online. I do recommend this game but you're better off buying this game during a sale.\n\nStory Mode - 9/10\nGraphics - 9.5/10\nOptimization - 10/10\nSoundtrack - 9/10\nGameplay - 8/10\nOnline - 7/10\n\nOverall: 8/10  thanks for reading","February 19","true","440.1"," 452 of 510 people (89%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","89","452","510","57","40"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/recommended/271590/","linusolsson","Z0mBi3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linusolsson/","2548 products in account","The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state. Rockstar obviously put a lot of time into the PC port/version. I'm usually against pre-ordering games, but I made one exception this year for GTA, and im happy with my decision. I didn't do it for the pre-order bonus (because that was frankly just a disappointing money cheat) , I did it just so I could preload all GB's in time for launch, because the game is ridiculously big.\n\nI'm running it at 60-90 fps on 1920x1080 with most things on "high", except for the advanced options, which is something you should only use if your running SLI or one really good card. I have a Nvidia gtx 680, which is a few years old now, so im very impressed with how good I can get the game to run. You can also use GeForce experience with GTA, because Nividia released a update for that day before launch.\n\nYou can play GTA in first or third person mode, and simply change between them on your controller. All cars have different interiors and looks when you are driving in first person. Some textures are a little blurry in first person, but that is something to expect in a game of this size. Fighting, swimming, walking can also be done in first person, so you can just pick what you like the best.\n\nIf you have an SSD drive that is big enough for this game you should probably use that for GTA, because the loading screens without it is sometimes very long. It's one of the only complains I have with GTA actually. Thankfully thats just when you are loading into story mode or online, because once you are in the big world there is no invisible walls or loading screens.\n\nSingleplayer is fun and the 3 main characters are all very well written. You can swap between them in the open world, but also in certain quests. Michael, Trevor and Franklin are very different from eachother which makes the game more interesting then GTA IV's only character, Niko.\n\nGTA online is probably what some people will spend a ton of time in. I really just bought it for the single-player experience, but after playing a few hours with my friends I have to say that GTA online is actually really fun. I think the missions will get kind off repetitive in the long run, but to play free-roam with friends will never get old. You also unlock heist in level 12, so that might refresh things even more.\n\nI play this game with an xbox controller and it seems like all friends I've talked to is doing the same thing. I strongly recommend it, at least for the driving. You can enable auto-aim on your controller if you think shooting with it is too hard, or you can swap between your keyboard+mouse in combat, and use controller for driving. When you crash your car and get hit the controll vibrates, which I think makes you feel more immersed in the game.\n\nI tried the PC controls and I didn't like them at all. For example you have to hit "Z" to see how many players are on your server in online mode. You can however rebind all keys on keyboard, mouse, and controller so thats really good, but the default ones on keyboard are not great im afraid.\n\nGTA is a fantastic open world game that will no doubt be played for many years to come. I have already played it a lot and I feel like I have much more leveling to do in GTA online, much more to do and explore in singleplayer and many hours of fun with my close friends to come. Singleplayer was all I really needed, so I will just see GTA online as a plus.\n\nWell done Rockstar! This is the best PC version you have ever made and I can see that you put a lot of effort, time and love into creating it. Strongly recommend this title to all my friends, whether your the single or multiplayer guy, you will have a ton of fun. This will probably be one of the best games released this year.","April 19, 2015","true","141.9"," 998 of 1,224 people (82%) found this review helpful 85 people found this review funny","82","998","1","85","109"

This kind of business practice is actually against ASA regulations, raising the price of a game and then putting it on sale to make it look like it's actually reduced is not considered a fair marketing strategy in the UK.\n\nWith regards to the bundle with "Great White Shark Cash Card" at the same price of £38.98, it's a move that isn't really on the side of the consumer or in the spirit of past steam sales. It has only been out for 2 months on PC so I don't think anyone was hoping for a big discount but putting it in a bundle and slapping a -25% discount on it really means the consumer isn't saving at all. They're getting some free in-game money which might be nice for some people but I think if most wanted the game + In-game money bundle they'd have prepurchased it when the in-game money was also free.\n\nI hope people don't just see the -25% discount and think they're getting a great deal by saving 25%, beacuse they're really not. You're either getting some free in-game money or - even worse - nothing at all with the standalone discount.

They've now stated this outright. I mean seriously, when did we start believing people who were banned, just because they say they're innocent? 90% of these new negative reviews are unfounded and outright lies. Not only that, but they have no changed the EULA, either. If you have a DLL injector installed in your game directory, it DOESN'T MAGICALLY STOP WORKING WHEN YOU GO ONLINE. Just because you don't use it, it's STILL there. YOUR OWN FAULT.\n\nLike seriously, when did people get dumb enough to think an anti cheat wouldn't pick up DLL INJECTORS? DLL INJECTORS ARE THE MOST COMMON WAY HACKS EXIST. *headdesks* There are two groups of people - actual cheaters, who got banned from online for cheating using the scripthook and trainer (dll injection), and then there's people who only used it in single player but left it installed when they went online. Newsflash - it's still there, it's still injected into the games memory.\n\nIn any case, the game is great. There's a few speed bumps and quirks here and there that need to be worked out, as with any game so soon after launch, but overall it performs great, online is fun, and you can mod single player. Not really a lot more you can ask for, amirite?\n\n9/10, because I don't believe in perfect scores.\n\nP.S. Stop being idiots.\n\nEdit: In light of a few ignorant jackasses, here's the proof:\nhttp://www.rockstargames.com/newswire\n“I’m having soo much fun with GTAV on the PC but I just have one question about it, how come you are not allowing mods for it?” - @ClarkMatthew63\n“Will I get banned from GTA Online for using a FoV Mod or Oculus Rift mod?” - @Mattophobia\n\nWe have always appreciated the creative efforts of the PC modding community and we still fondly remember the awesome zombie invasion mod and original GTA map mod for GTAIV PC among many other classics. To be clear, the modding policy in our license has not changed and is the same as for GTAIV.  Recent updates to GTAV PC had an unintended effect of making unplayable certain single player modifications. This was not intentional, no one has been banned for using single player modifications, and you should not worry about being banned or being relegated to the cheater pool just for using single player PC mods. Our primary focus is on protecting GTA Online against modifications that could give players an unfair advantage, disrupt gameplay, or cause griefing. It also bears mentioning that because game mods are by definition unauthorized, they may be broken by technical updates, cause instability, or affect your game in other unforeseen ways.\nBut by all means - let's just believe the banned people because they said "they didn't do it". It's not like cheaters to lie about it or anything.","May 7, 2015","true","145.2"," 2,226 of 2,793 people (80%) found this review helpful 259 people found this review funny","80","226","2","259","130"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kastrenzo/recommended/271590/","kastrenzo","Kastrenzo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kastrenzo/","325 products in account","I feel I can only write a review for GTA Online, as Grand theft Auto V has been left in the dust since it launched on PC, All of Rockstar's attention goes into GTA Online now. Buying GTA V is basically just a means of distribution for the Online component.\n\nI'm level 99 or something like that, I feel I've played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it, so let's begin.\n\n\n\n- Base game hasn't recieved an update since the first weeks of launch, they don't even port Online cars to it anymore. And they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer. Looks like they don't want you trying something before you spend half a million GTAbucks on it only to find you don't like it.\n\n- Very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes, most of the time it's the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two, a gun that no one wants, like the antique pistol for example, and some tacky clothing options.  For an online game that's technically been going for 3 years, there's been very little innovation.\n\n- The whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys, and once you've got everything you want, and once you get bored of the missions, adversary modes and races, and get tired of screwing around in freemode, the game becomes pointless, just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego, and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving Chrome Adders and sitting on golden Yachts\n\n- Rockstar doesn't think when it comes to implementing game features, the bad sport system is horribly abused. More often than not I find myself getting "bad sport points" for doing nothing else but defending myself against an Armoured Kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight.  Do that enough and all of a sudden you're broke, and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters... not that there's any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones, and on the topic of cheating\n\n- The cheating is just insane. it's out of control, Rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game, and usually it's not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co-op mission, more often than not it's just straight out griefing.  Getting C130s dropped on you, cars exploding for no reason, having a gang of stripper NPCs with miniguns spawned on you.  And then you've also got people who spawn moneybags on others, which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because Rockstar rarely bans, punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money, just the one who spawned it. They slap cheaters on the wrist, often using a strike system, the first 2 or 3 times you're caught, you get banned for a week or two. It should be permanent. There is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size\n\n- Free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys, racists, griefers, hackers, tryhards, screamers and squeakers. Freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off, and play with all the things you earned during your missions, and you're extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn't full of hackers, Raging griefers with tanks, or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice/chat.\n\nGTA Online is like one of the seven circles of hell, it's a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half-wits who get off to a toxic, unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment.\n\nIt's a shame, because GTA V isn't that bad of a game,  I think GTA IV was ahead of it's time, and I still enjoy it even though it doesn't run too well anymore for some reason.   but GTA V has largely been forgotten since it first launched, because in this industry, if an action game isn't an online game, it's irrelevant.\n\nGTA V: An impressive technical achievement, hit some nails on the head, missed some others compared to it's predecessors.\n\nGTA Online: A toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs.","May 9","false","464.0"," 351 of 415 people (85%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","85","351","415","34","10"

If that's our standard for goodness... then no wonder this country's screwed." - Michael De Santa\n\nSTORY (No Spoilers)Grand Theft Auto V pits the player into the roles of the three main protagonists: Michael, a married man suffering from a midlife crisis, Franklin, a gangster trying to make a change for himself, and Trevor, who's just a Canadian psychopath. The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades.\n\nThe game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on.\nWhen you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dog—Chop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)!\n\nGTA ONLINE:\nThe GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance.\n\nAfter you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy).\n\nThere are multiple game modes in Online, including:\nFree Roam - Run around with up to 32 of your closest friends (or enemies), causing chaos and other nonsense. You can also compete in mini-games, such as target practice, arm wrestling, golf, and tennis. If you don't like to be killed constantly by other players in Free Roam, you can play in Solo Mode, but you'll be unable to play game modes that require more than one player.\nMissions - These are given out by characters in GTAV (Lamar, Gerald, Martin, etc.), and are co-op jobs with up to 4 players.\nSurvival - Try to survive up to ten waves of enemies with 3 other players.\nPVP - There are multiple subsets of this, including: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch (Free for all), Vehicle Deathmatch, Team Elimination (You only have one life.), Capture (A twist to Capture the Flag), Objective-based missions (Complete a objective, while the enemy team tries to do the same), races, and parachuting.\nHeists - These are my personal favourite. With up to three of your friends (friends are highly recommended, unless you want to fail the heist repeatedly), you can perform challenging and rewarding missions to obtain lots of cash and exclusive heist vehicles. Unlike basic jobs, these heists involve multiple sub-jobs within them called Heist Setups that must be completed prior to the Heist Finale. As the heist leader, you can set what crew member does what job and their pay for doing that job. Teamwork is essential because the entire team shares one extra life (or none at all if the dificulty is above normal), and if that life is expended, the current mission fails and you'll have to restart it.\nThere are multiple glitches in GTA Online, some are funny and weird, the others are exploits and game-breaking. So far I haven't seen any hackers, but I wouldn't doubt their existence.\n\nFinal VerdictIn retrospect, I give Grand Theft Auto V a 9/10\n+ Amazing story\n+ Excellent gameplay\n+ Fun with friends, and fun without them!\n+ Great graphics\n+ GTA Editor\n+ Heists are fun and replayable for more cash\n- Glitches\n\n"Now go!

It takes waaay to long to load online (close to 5 minutes on a high end pc like mine) and once you get there it is miserable to play. Nearly every session i have joined the past 2 weeks has at least one hacker either giving everyone money, or just running around with invincibility killing everyone. What finally pushed me over the edge is when I was playing online with a friend doing our own thing and then all of a sudden everyone on the server dies because they are crushed by falling rocks, then there is a clone of the character stuck to my body and even after killing it and myself, it just stayed. It only gets worse, my friend and I didn't mind it to much and it was a bit comical at times, but then we are all killed again except this time blown up which destroyed my car that I had to make the claim on and drained all cash and removed all guns. About 30 seconds after that it was flooded, literally. I did what a responsible person would do and reported the hacker as i have to most of the other hackers that I pass by and what does Rockstar do? Nothing. Absolutely &%$#ing nothing to the point where I saw the same hacker a week later doing the same thing in a different server. It has gotten to the point where I don't even bother playing online anymore because you simply can't.\n\nTL:DR Version:\nRockstar needs to get it together with banning hackers, and until then, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you plan on playing online or it will be miserable for you.","May 31, 2015","false","255.8"," 199 of 229 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","199","229","0","1"

Horrible online "community".\n\nIf you find yourself shooting players who can't be killed, being constantly warped to the top of the FIB building, or being killed while in passive mode, you're probably having your gaming experience ruined by one or more Russians.  Here’s how to identify/avoid them:\n\n1.  Don't play between 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. EST.  That’s 1:00 - 5:00 p.m. in Putingrad and the time you’re more likely to catch them between blackout hangovers.\n\n2.  If you see a guy trying to give his T20 a carrot "to make go", he's red. He's probably more Borat than Ivan Drago, but eh...  All the same, really.  Do I look like an anthropologist or a zookeeper?\n\n3.  Insurance fraud and frivolous lawsuits count for ~ 97% of local GDP in the motherland.  If a player dives in front of your speeding car for no reason, he’s likely a Russian.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/271590/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid-2013, and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014, before finally being released on the PC in April 2015.  The game quite rightly is a record setter, selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day, before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards.\n\nGTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists, who each have their own story and plot to go with them – somehow all three of these characters’s path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other’s story.  The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game, cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game’s physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also, I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before, but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics.  I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times, since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard, I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane, but the flying parts of the game are few and far between.  The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters; these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire’s collection, right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do, and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored.\n\nThe game has gorgeous graphics, no they aren’t photo realistic, but that’s because the game’s style isn’t aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming; it just puts the console’s version to shame when you compare the two.  My rig which is a monster, couldn’t handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions, but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p, and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time, but GTA V does none of that; each of the textures are all high res, animation is absolutely perfect, and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game.\n\nAs with all GTA games, you are going to get a blockbuster style story line, this is one of the best, if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character’s story are so well written, and perfectly intertwining with each other.  The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level, some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it; but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game, there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete, they all have some sort of story behind them for each character, which are all well worth your time in completing.\n\nThe sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren’t real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too, there is never a moment where there is just silence, whether it is people in the street chatting to each other, or someone getting road rage, there is always something going on.  Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station, so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map.\n\nThe game isn’t exactly hard, there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons, such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!), but I don’t think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind, since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty.\n\nLos Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made, it is bigger than GTA IV, GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions, the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do, whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs, helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day’s work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.\n\nThe main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete, I still have plenty of heists, extra missions, stunts, races…so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything, and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once, I cannot be 100% sure on this, but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again, there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose.\n\nTechnically, GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible, but they really knocked it out of the park here.  The abundance of graphical options, audio options, and options in general, really make this a proper PC game.  The game can be played on a gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad, but the game is so well optimized for the PC, the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me - it just plays so fluidly.\n\nI am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game, and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay, exquisite story line, and huge open world for you to explore;  it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is – it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Countless bugs. When you do a heist there is about a 50% chance that you cannot finish it because of a bug. I am not even kidding. That means if you spend 2 hours on a heist, you are only actually playing the real game for 1 hour, as most of these bugs require a restart of the game.\n\n2. Crashes. Random crashes occur all the time. Not only that, but some crashes are so terrible that it requires you to reinstall the game. One friend of mine has reinstalled the game more than 10 times now, I am yet again not kidding. More than 10 times he needed to download the entire game again, which is about 60gb each time.\n\n3. Glitches. The only thing in the online game that is important is money. You can buy money from the store of the game, but that is never needed. There are multiple glitches and hacks which can make you a millionaire from doing nothing. That is destroying the gameplay a lot, and the programming level of this game to make these hacks possible is just terribly low (I am a programmer myself, and I am shocked that Rockstar Games managed to do this).\n\n4. Online in a random game is just terrible gameplay. If you are in a car (which you most likely are), people will just one hit you with an RPG or a Homing Launcher. These players then have to pay a fine for your car if it was insured, which it most likely is. That means that they have to pay for the missile shot ($1500) and then the car (~$6000), but they do not care and think that they have "won" the battle, even if they payed for it.\nThis either means that people are just not smart enough in this game to understand that what they do actually makes them lose a lot of money, or that those players are using the glitches to have unlimited money, and can therefore just waste money to win in PvP. That means that money is much greater than skill in this game.\n\n5. Heists. Apart from all the bugs, finding people to go to a heist with is just horrible. Most people can't even speak or type in english. This makes it impossible to finish a heist with random people. You have to use external websites to find a heist team, and even then its hard to find people that can actually finish a heist (about 5% chance to win a heist each try, hours and hours doing the same thing over and over).\nEven if you finish all heists in a row, or without dying at all, there are bugs that removes the additional money given for achievements. This means that you can spend around 10 hours doing an achievement, and then when you should get $10 000 000 for it, you just get nothing.\n\nI always wanted to work at Rockstar Games, but now I feel that I have nothing to learn from them. How can they fail so miserably making a game that works with that much money?","May 19, 2015","false","233.8"," 198 of 242 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","198","242","4","9"

We've all been waiting for you.\n\n\nEDIT: After playing for a while I can attach a more informative review. Will update further when enough time is spent with the story and Online portion.\n\nPerformance-wise, the game runs relatively well on my GTX 680. I have suffered from an apparent memory leak bug that forces me to shut down the game, but it can be fixed by adding more virtual memory page file size (look it up on the internet). Aside from that, the launch has been relatively smooth for me.\n\nThe game world is full of detail. Put on sunglasses and you notice your vision is actually tinted. Park your bike in front of an entrance and a guy might shout you to move it. It's really the kind of benchmark-setting experience that makes other open world games look bland and lifeless.\n\nIn my opinion, the story and mission pacing are far steadier and faster than in GTA IV.\nDriving is a little bit better, hard to pinpoint exactly what makes it so, but to me it feels more responsive. Shooting can feel clumsy, especially in first-person, and the guns don't feel all that special, but it's still fun.\n\nIn addition to the updated graphics, the other PC-exclusive features include a custom radio station and the Rockstar Editor. Custom radio station is pretty simple. Add music files to a folder in the Documents, and you've got a Self Radio station in-game. It works, nothing more to add.\n\nAs for the Rockstar Editor, it's really simple and fun to use. You mainly use markers to change cameras, apply effects, slow motion et cetera. I tested it for a bit and the end result is this:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wsQ_Gyd4Y4\n\n(I'm planning to make longer and better videos in the near future)\n\nThe online feature can be a little bit confusing for new players to get into first, since it lacks direction, but you'll get it. Haven't played it too much to comment further, but it's fun to play jobs with friends, although the progression feels half-baked.\n\nThanks for reading my review.

Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.\n\n2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me.\n\na) Day/Night cycle recreation. Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.\n\nb) Rain. Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one BUT the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well, THE SOUND. This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).\n\nc) Night time, baby! Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.\n\n3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.\n\nGameplay and Features\n\nOh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.\n\n1. Car Control I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.\n\n2. Randomness. Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get ♥♥♥♥♥, a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.\n\n3. Los Santos Customs. Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism AFTER the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game.\n\n4. Activities.

I cant say Ive ever had a game I both loved and hated at the same time.\nI'll start off by saying that this game IS good. My negative review is simply because it doesnt deserve such high praise.\n\nEverything in this game thats good is offset by something bad, almost always tied directly to Rockstar being greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. The world is incredible. Beautiful map, the amount of detail is astonishing. The vehicles are fantastic. Theres plenty to do and see. Its also a NIGHTMARE to play.\n\nYou'd think some of that over $500,000,000 they made JUST IN MICROTRANSACTION SALES would go into moderating the online play, but that would cut into their profits.\n\nIt is next to impossible to join a single server that isnt plagued with MULTIPLE modders. Almost all of which do nothing but blow you up, teleport and godmode their way to win events, strip your weapons, and crash your client. Considering the price of EVERYTHING in this game is set by Rockstar to try to make you buy their horrendously overpriced shark cards, Having modders ruin damn near everything in the game that you can use to make money makes it next to impossible to buy anything if you werent lucky enough to have had cash dumped on you ages ago that didnt get you banned. The only modders Rockstar ever seems to even try to deal with are the ones that spawn money, because Rockstar doesnt care about players who are ruining the game, only ones that might make them lose money from microtransactions.\n\nOnce Rockstar has your money for the game, they dont give a ♥♥♥♥ how your gameplay is.\n\nThey even removed the ability to email information about modders in, which could include video footage. Now its just the report button. Which the latest mod menus seem to be able to block from sending anyways, from what everyone says now.\n\nI dont regret having bought the game, but its saddening to see Rockstar going the way of EA and so many AAA game devs these days. I'll honestly have to think hard about it on whether I'd be willing to buy a new GTA after this one.\n\nI miss the developer that ruined my childhood innocence with San Andreas back in the day.

You'll find yourself constantly surprised by the level of detail that Rockstar put into this massive world. Gorgeous lighting effects, incredible weather effects, fantastic audio, and smooth animations come together to immerse you in Los Santos on a whole new level, especially when you check out First Person mode. As with most games though, faces leave something to be desired, though they are a huge leap from GTA IV.     Gameplay  10  From raging shootouts, to daring getaways, GTA V is a game that's hard to step away from once you start playing. Fantastic levels of customization for your clothing, cars and hair. The well-written dialogue and voice acting help to bring Los Santos to life as you ride through a bustling downtown, or take a relaxing drive through the mountains. Time and time again you'll turn a corner and find yourself complete surprised at what you find there. You could easily waste hours just poking around the environment. There is something here for everyone.     Story  7  A decent length story to go through, which spans across multiple intertwining characters. GTA V delivers another decent story by Rockstar. Though not particularly enthralling for the first bit, it certainly picks up the pace as it gets further along. You'll meet some fantastically outlandish characters in typical Rockstar fanshion, and get caught up in some ridiculous events. GTA V accomplishes what it sets out to be, a blast from start to finish.    Multiplayer  9.5  This is frankly where GTA V shines the most. A massive improvement upon GTA IV's multiplayer. With the inclusion of Heists, GTA V added a grand amount of depth to the multiplayer, allowing you to set out on multi-step missions with your friends. Or, you can simply cruise around Los Santos and murder as you please. Take selfies together in hilarious places, get in fistfights on top of skyscrapers. Skydive, swim, play darts, tennis, or golf. Watch a movie, go to strip club! Get completely smashed!  Survive an onslaught of Meth dealers, or cops, together! Play it however you want, create the character you prefer with a great level of customization being offered. The only place that GTA V loses points is in its absolutely awful menu system. Creating a private session, much less staying in it, with your friends is a convoluted process that Rockstar hopefully sorts out. Loading times are also horrendous, even with the game installed on an SSD. But don't let that stop you from playing multiplayer in GTA V. It is not an experience you want to miss out on.    Replayability  10  There are plenty of ways to die in Los Santos, and you'll spend a long time enjoying each and every one of them. Especially with your friends. The huge array of missions and activities in the world offer you plenty of incentive to come back and play again and again.    Overall  9.6/10  Though it took Rockstar an absurd amount of time to prepare the PC version of GTA V, it's a slam dunk by all accounts. Easily the best GTA yet, especially when multiplayer is taken into consideration. With massive replay value, great graphics, enjoyable gameplay, and lots more going for it, GTA V is a game that any player would be hard pressed not to enjoy.\n\nAlso of worthy note is the video editor: Here's a clip I put together of my friends and I having some fun: The Chase\nIf you liked this review, feel free to check out my curator page:\nThe Tipster\n\nYou are also welcome to join our group and play/discuss games together, here:  The Tipster","April 25, 2015","true","75.5"," 206 of 265 people (78%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","78","206","265","16","9"

On top of this, Rockstar (initially) pulled the base game from their store page, which made it seem like the cash card bundle was the only version of the game you could purchase (effectively hiding the fact that the base game is not actually on sale).\n\nTo top everything off though, purchasing the cash card bundle is basically Rockstar's way of skirting around Steam's new refund policy. Buying the bundle and starting up the game immediately ties the cash card to your account, which disqualifies you from requesting a refund even if you play the game for less than two hours. It's a ♥♥♥♥ move. I'm just disappointed I've already given Rockstar my money. Wish I could get it back.\n\nWon't be buying another Rockstar game anytime soon.","June 12, 2015","false","150.7"," 108 of 127 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","108","127","2","1"

No complaints in the optimization department.\n\nEDIT: I got a Radeon R9 290 4GB video card not long after getting the game and it is a WORLD of difference if you are able to run it at higher settings.  When you have the minimum settings (what you would need to select if running on a 5870) compared against high settings on the 290, it's like playing a different game entirely.  This game is beautiful.  On the graphics menu I can set every option to the maximum setting and I leave anti-aliasing at 2x, then on the advanced graphics menu I leave everything at the lowest possible setting.  I hear people with SLI Titans can barely max outo the advanced menu and I watched a guy on youtube with 4x R9 290s and he didn't even use as high of a setting selection as I did with just one.  It depends on what framerate you want, 120, 60, or 30 FPS is possible depending if you have the hardware to back it up.  Maybe one day a video card will exist which is affordable and can truly max the game out, but trust me this game is able to really well optimized.  I had originally a quad core Phenom II X4 965 processor in my computer and it ran all cores at exactly 100% solid the whole time I played.  On any settings.  I didn't feel like buying a new motherboard just yet so I went on eBay and got a 6-core Phenom II X6 1055T to swap in there, and instantly my whole game became way smoother.  It sits at 70-80% usage across all 6 cores the whole time I am playing if not more.  This 5-6 year old platform can run pretty much any newer game out there but nothing has been able to tap it and use all of it's resources so efficiently than GTA5.\n\nI must say, the PC options are fantastic.  There is a LOT of tweaking to do, especially in regards to the controller and keyboard settings in addition to the expansive performance tweaks.  My favorite part is having a keyboard and mouse and gamepad in front of me and when the game gets to an intense shooting part I can put down my controller and use the keyboard/mouse and start shooting without having to go to a settings menu and change anything.  It just works.  It's perfect.\n\nThe gameplay itself needs no introduction.  You can do pretty much anything.  Even online play is pretty good, first time I played two guys were in an airplane and nosedived right into me while on foot and everyone died.\n\n10/10","April 15, 2015","true","81.4"," 286 of 383 people (75%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","75","286","383","52","6"

As you have probably read, it is impossible to get a real 'discount' on the game as they have decided to instead bunch it together with a shark card leaving the game with no real discount. Not only does mean that the game isn't really on a discount, it also means that you probably won't be able to refund it in case something goes wrong or if you change your mind because of the unrefundable micro transaction along with it. I preorded this game before it came out, but for players who do not currently own it and are considering it, I would probably wait until this is over. Hopefully Rockstar will see how angry the Steam community is about this and sort it out. Until then, I would suggest waiting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pandemic195/recommended/271590/","pandemic195","(╭ರ_•́) Comrade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pandemic195/","23 products in account","GTA 5 is a bit of a conundrum for me, because I can't really review the whole thing as one game. GTA 5's campaign and GTA online are two very different things, and deserve two completely different reviews (I also want to note, I've also played this on PS3 pretty much since it came out, and have played WAY too many hours on it on console).\n\nFirst off is GTA 5's single player campaign, which is, in my opinion, really REALLY good. There's not much more to say other than that the characters are all pretty damn fun to play as. The game is just good, and the attention to detail is surprising in some areas. You wouldn't think that a group developing a sandbox crime heist em up would spend too much time on the little things like golf or tennis, but both of them play really well. The golf in particular probably plays better than some games that are completely dedicated exclusively to golf. From GTA 4, the driving, shooting and melee attacks are all vastly improved aswell.\n\nNow the tumorous, microtransaction riddled elephant in the room, GTA Online. Simply put, it's a massive grind. Apartments that you can set up heists from are so expensive you won't be buying one for a pretty long time. New cars are similarly overpriced (the newest super car in the game costs 2 million). Vehicle modifications such as armor, engine tune ups, suspension, and so on are many times more expensive than they are in single player, and completely uncustomizable vehicles like planes, helicopters and boats tend to cost even more than apartments do (because logic I guess). All of this seems to have been done solely for the purpose of selling Shark Cards, Rockstar's overpriced means of aquiring money with no effort. You can buy these cards at prices ranging from 2.99 (which I believe only gets you a  hundred thousand, not enough to buy and upgrade 1 single gun with full ammo) to 99.99 (which gives you 8 million). Looking back at their newest super car at 2 million, that means that if you want to avoid the grind, it will cost you around 50 real life dollars of REAL MONEY, to fully upgrade a fake car that only exists in a video game, leaving you with just a little spending money. Even more ludicrous are the new yachts, which act as big floating player homes in the ocean. These start just shy of 5 million. To put it plainly, according to Rockstar, they seem to think that a fake yacht in a game is worth roughly 60 to 70 dollars in real life money. This is more than the retail price of GTA itself, and is just aweful.\n\nTo sum up this half rant/half praise of a review, it almost seems as though GTA 5 was designed and developed by a group of dedicated professional game developers, who cared about what they were doing and wanted to make a genuinely good game, and they did just that. The game that is GTA 5 is still a very good game, and the campaign has a fair bit of replayability to it. The city of Los Santos is colorful and fun, and even out in the country side, there's an astonishing amount of detail. However, it's like this team of good game designers were just sort of set aside when it came to GTA Online, at which point Rockstar decided to have a group of accountants design just about everything. Everything about GTA Online exists to make money, from the painful grind to the overpriced useless tat. It's really a shame because once you've played the heists (which reward you with almost nothing but more cars, boats, planes, etc. to buy) there's no more reason to play the game. If you just like pvp combat there are better games out there dedicated solely to pvp. If you just like to race fast cars there's better experiences to be had. It's because of GTA Online that I can't reccomend buying GTA 5 all together, especially when Rockstar seems determined not to focus any effort on any new single player content. This is all coming from someone who has been playing GTA 5 since release, and it's sad to see this happen to a game that so many had high hopes for.","May 10","false","97.1"," 138 of 174 people (79%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","79","138","174","13","3"

It was quite clear that\nconsole users rack up more money and that is exactely why Rockstar decided to wait 1,5 years for the PC release.\n\nThis company doesn't care about the players anymore.\nFor example: GTA Online is becoming a disaster. The modders totally ruin the game. You can find a hacker in every single session you join. Before, it was a bit better. Now, due to the absence of any anti-cheat, the modders just roam the map and decide to ruin everyone's game experience. Rockstar doesn't seem to care at all.\nDon't get me started on the loading times. Joining or hosting a mission/heist may take up to 10 minutes. Leaving the game takes time, getting into the game takes even more time. Sometimes the game just fails to connect to Online and puts you automatically into single player, which is ridiculous and takes more time. They should've really made something like SA-MP was - offer independent servers to be rented out, so that people can choose, which gamemode to play.\n\nWell, You may check my game hours and say that I am full of crap. I bought this game for Online. I tolerated the loading times and the little-to-none hackers in the beginning of the PC release. Now, I have understood that Online is over-hyped and quite boring, plus, with hackers, it is impossible to enjoy freemode, as I constantly have to put on Passive Mode, to prevent getting killed instantly by an atomic bomb or whatever hacks these guys have.\n\nIf you really like GTA francise, buy the game after the Summer Sale, as Rockstar decided to grab even more money, before they leave this game. If you don't want to cope with the problems this game currently has, wait for a bit. Maybe in 3 months, they have put a anti-cheat system into Online and fixed the loading times.

Online is riddled with hackers which remotely explode players, pull their names and make it look like a different player is killing other players, set players on fire remotely, spew money and hand out RP like candy on Halloween, and even if you play in private sessions with friends and nobody else, you're still going to spend an absolutely colossal amount of time grinding for RP and GTA$... unless you buy Shark Cards!\n\nWhat did FiveM do? It offered multiplayer with the freedom to do whatever anyone wanted to. Cars, jets, money, weapons... we would've had custom missions if the project hadn't been shut down. Measures were implemented to prevent pirates from getting multiplayer capability, and the option existed for server administration and custom anti-cheating systems. Most importantly, however, there wasn't an arbitrary unlock system designed around levelling up. There was no cause or need for microtransactions, no need or use for Shark Cards, and no JRPG-insult of a grind! Everything was available from the start. It is also worth mentioning that these projects didn't interfere at all with GTA:Online's functionality, neither were able to be carried into the other, and to the best of my knowledge, it was never planned on.\n\nGTA5's singleplayer leaves little to be desired aside from a still-existing problem we've had since its first release on the previous generation of consoles; cars, planes, boats, and what have you will ALL disappear forever if they get destroyed, you start a mission, you leave the general area they're in, or the game just feels like being hateful for no particular reason. The only cars which see an exemption from this are the ones the main characters start with, which while of respectable performance after upgrades, aren't enough for some of us.\n\nI really, really don't like it when I've dropped a few million $ on a supercar and its upgrades, only for that car to despawn and never be seen again because I drove it to a mission.  It has been a little over 2 years now that GTA 5 has existed. Singleplayer mode has, to the best of my knowledge, suffered this disappearing car problem since day 1. However...\n\nGTA: Online lets you mark a car with a tracker, lets you insure it so you don't blow $3+million for nothing, and you can switch to a different, faster car if you just unlock it and perform the requisite grinding... which is faster if you buy Shark Cards!\n\nThis tracker option doesn't really exist in Singleplayer, but it could! In fact, it seems to exist partially, in that character-specific vehicles are 'almost' always marked on your minimap. They can still despawn, but they'll usually respawn (at a safehouse, usually far away from your current location) and you'll be able to find them without paying anything... which is still a broken system, because they're still disappearing and you can't replace them with a different car.\n\nIf I have 300 million in SP mode but I still can't upgrade a player character's personal vehicle to a Zentorno, Osiris, Adder, or ANYTHING AT ALL (not even an Emperor), then there is clear favoritism for GTA: Online where we, without doubt, CAN upgrade... but it'll cost us, and we WILL pay, whether it be in time or money for $HARK CARD$!!!\n\nThese may seem like small complaints, but they really aren't. A bug which existed since Day 1 still isn't fixed, a Quality-of-Life update which Singleplayer would benefit from only exists in Online mode, and TakeTwo stamped out both of the alternatives to their poorly secured, microtransaction-riddled, hacker-filled grindfest.\n\nLet me state clearly that Rockstar is not at fault here; it's just TakeTwo, pulling a page from EA and Activision on how to be a publisher with all the qualities so many gamers have grown to hate. GTA 5's Singleplayer is good, but it isn't perfect. GTA:Online is ultimately a system to facilitate microtransactions, and isn't worth much more than that.\n\nI payed $75 to play GTA5; $30 for my PS3 copy and $45 through a Steam sale. Thanks to TakeTwo's actions, I realize now that I've payed far too much, and that I can't rely on the PC community to make the game any better unless they take a humongous legal risk. Furthermore, seeing as Singleplayer is missing some of the Online-improvement functions for no good reason but the promotion of Online mode (which as previously mentioned is not at all 'hacksafe' to play without people you trust), I am led to draw the conclusion that roughly 5% of Online Mode is in an acceptable state, and roughly 95% of Singleplayer is in an acceptable state.\n\nI'd call GTAV 50% acceptable, 40% scam, and 10% bad decisions. We can't mod or take any control over the one part of it that needs it most because TakeTwo Interactive said so. The only part of this game I'd consider acceptable for the Master Race is the only part I'd consider acceptable for the console peasantry, and that's SinglePlayer. In the defense of every race, I suggest nobody pay full price. Get it in a Steam Sale, or better yet, buy used on a console, if you absolutely must have it. Everyone suffers, your gaming racial and social statuses means nothing to TakeTwo.\n\nUpdate Singleplayer and do something about the current Online model. Dedicated Servers with custom Anti-Cheat scripts and an Administrator would do a better job, and modding support would make it an example of real PC Racial Mastery.\n\nKeep GTA:Online functioning for all I care and make Dedicated Servers entirely serperate from it. I just want real multiplayer modding support and not need to grind like I'm playing a JRPG. There are people who have good ideas to make GTA5 better than what it is, and some of these ideas are the addition of what so many PC games already have.\n\nThere has not been, and never will be, an excuse of great enough magnitude for these problems still existing.\n\n5/10, Online is HORRENDOUS and being used as an excuse to keep Singleplayer out of date, because microtransactions.","December 17, 2015","false","137.6"," 1,110 of 1,597 people (70%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","70","110","1","93","72"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/recommended/271590/","Coeco","Coe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Coeco/","270 products in account","GTA V is one of the most profound and mind-numbing examples on how you can take 'the' most recognized video game franchise on earth and turn it into a cancerous clusterfùck of hideously moronic design decisions that have no equal in terms of the sheer stupidity and broken functionality that currently plagues this depressingly messed-up title.\n\nAs the faults with this game are numerous and require their own individual attention, I am simply going to list them, one by one while providing proof of their existence.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. Online functionality.\n\nPutting aside the current average load times of getting into the online game being 1.6-3 minutes for people with top-tier gaming PC's that have SSD's, the state of the GTA servers as of right now are a horrendous mess, as anyone that played the game on console (or even watched videos of others doing so) for more than 3 hours can attest to. The problems from there has not been dealt with for the PC version.\n\nDisconnect after network failure after server outage after connection issues after time-outs after server overloads, Rockstar continues their behavior of not knowing how to host proper servers. Even after delaying the PC release a multiple amount of times for dozens of month and perhaps more importantly, giving out fat bonuses to people who pre-order weeks before release to massively help them gain a better idea of the incoming traffic, they still fail horrendously to offer any kind of steady service when the online aspect of the game is concerned. It is however, made much worse by how the multiplayer is constructed around clumsy lobby systems with ZERO flexibility. Go through the effort of creating a heist and wait for players to fill the lobby, play 95% of the mission and have someone disconnect? MISSION CANCELLED, LOBBY CLOSED DOWN, CREATE A NEW GAME MANUALLY AND WAIT FOR PLAYERS TO RE-JOIN TO START AT SQUARE 1 AGAIN. Let someone join mid-game to replace him? Pause the heist itself and give the disconnected player time to rejoin? Create an AI partner to take his place? Nope, back to the 2 minute loading screens with you. Over. And Over. And Over Again.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FDJoz1BeoM\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n2. System functionality.\n\nMemory leaks, physics glitches that causes crashes, black screens, FPS spikes, blue-screens, graphic-driver crashes and  cases of just plain bad optimization where laptops would have the game run off their integrated GPU's first before checking for any 'external' ones. GTA V has them all and It is a very depressing fact to face after all those months upon months of waiting for the game to be, and I quote: "As polished as possible"\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/GrandTheftAutoV_PC/comments/32od4r/gta5_crashes_mega_thread\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3. Cheaters.\n\nOn both offline AND online, the number of cheaters have been routinely going up in terms of being spotted by the community and they show little to no signs of slowing down:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAEUe0SFvBI\n\nDue to the manner that Rockstar handles hackers (by slowly detecting them and putting them in queue to only be in games with other cheaters), they can cause MASSIVE amounts of havoc, most of which end up being beyond repair and going outside the control of Rockstar themselves due to the dynamic nature of the game. The most acute symptom of this very serious issue is the server stability for where these hackers roam. As seen in the video, the hacker spammed UFO's and caused insane amounts of lag to happen due to flooding the host with collission data, vehicle spawns and teleports while also flooding other players with money drops. The much more chronic results are perhaps more damaging as money can trade hands in so many ways. Be it, being dropped on the street, have someone get mugged, spend it on cars & other items and re-sell/give them away.. The list goes on and most of these things, Rockstar can't reliably keep record of and this isn't even where the issues stop either.\n\nThere are also other more logistical things to keep track of. For example: They have to dedicate a number of their servers to actually put hackers on, meaning they are redirecting company resources to let hackers roam around instead of focusing these efforts on contributing to a more positive experience for the non-offending players. Even then, hackers are allowed to purchase new accounts and keep on creating massive amounts of havoc as punishment is lingering at best and there are no immediate counter-measures to deal with these situations.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n4. System Design.\n\nIf you were to ask me what personally disgusts me the most about this game, It has to be without the shadow of a doubt, the "Bad Sport" system. How does it work? It bans you from the regular multiplayer (including private sessions with your friends), separating you from everyone else if you blow up other player's cars, leave online games early or simply get reports.\n\nSounds like a necessary thing on paper with GTA being what it is, but oh the cancer that can be find if you observe it more closely. Here are 4 scenarios where the game will punish you and cut out your ability to play Online:\n\na) Defend yourself from someone trying to drive-by you in an armored kuruma by blowing them up with a grenade: You're a bad sport.\n\nb) Stay AFK in a tank or some other heavy vehicle and have people drive under you with their own cars and explode as a result: You're a bad sport.\n\nc) Have your game crash during a multiplayer session due to GTA V's notorious memory leak: You're a bad sport.\n\nd) Own a couple of guys in fair death-matches or similar over the thousands of hours you spent in GTA V and have them spam reports against you with no legitimacy to them whatsoever: You're a bad sport.\n\n-----------\n\nI thought this was a beta thing at first, perhaps a myth or something exclusively on the console.. But one faithful day when I just finished a mission and was outside my apartment, fiddling with my settings, a guy rams into my car from behind using an armored kuruma and proceeds to try and mow me down with an SMG. I pull out a sticky bomb, slap it onto his windshield, drive away and proceed to detonate the bomb as he continues trying to kill me. Boom, he dies along with his Armored Kuruma (which is nigh impossible to only kill the players within using guns)... And:\n\nYOU HAVE BEEN FLAGGED AS A BAD-SPORT. Bye bye playing with friends, bye bye actual multiplayer (as everyone who is a bad sport just waits their time out or jumps onto another account/plays offline), bye bye GTA Online as a whole. The first ban you'll get will be 2-3 days (48-72 hours) that cannot be reduced (used to be possible by getting awards, etc, not anymore), next one will be weeks, then months, then years and they will be that much more easy to get after your first one. The timer can be extended if you continue being a "Bad sport" by blowing up people's cars and It will very frequently get stuck as well, sometimes even resetting if you do certain jobs, missions or activities. It is one of THE most hated 'functions' of GTA V Online and Rockstar does absolutely NOTHING about it.\n\nIt is even a walking contradiction itself as the design goal of it is to dissuade people from doing, and I quote here: "Doing Unsanctioned Mayhem". The problem here is that THERE IS NO SYSTEM OR DETECTION METHOD IN-PLACE TO EVEN REMOTELY DETERMINE IF A CERTAIN MAYHEM WAS SANCTIONED OR NOT IN THE GAME.\n\nNow Rockstar have also recently broken the game even further with FPS killing patches.\n\nJust.. Ugh.","October 25, 2015","false","298.3"," 583 of 830 people (70%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","70","583","830","68","32"

I am very happy but not surprised that the game runs so well! Most likely because it's a parallel developed PC game and not a lousy port.\n\nThe missions in this game are extremely fun, the heists and the story is very interesting surrounding these three men. I did not skip a single cutscene.\n\nThe Online portion of this game feels like an MMORPG, you level up, gain money and buy transport, weapons, clothes and your very own apartment. Rockstar is constantly developing content for Online and so far the best update for GTAO that has ever come out is the Online Heists. Well, Online freemode with randoms feels like World War 3 so I suggest you play on Invite Only lobbies until you get a decent level.\n\nModding is supported by Rockstar which is great but keep it outside of Online, you don't want to get banned. .dll injectors and such stay away from them since they're classified as cheats. ONLY MOD OFFLINE!\n\nI know I didn't review this game like AngryJoe.

Mainly because of three reasons:\n\nReason #1\nHackers/modders in pretty much every session I join, either killing you instantly or just makes every player on the map explode as soon as they spawn, even when being in passive mode..\n\nReason #2\nThe "server" system is terrible. As far as I know there isn't even any real servers. It's just some p2p/cloud service, where your experience depends on the other players connection. So every time you get matched with some chinese player, which seem to happen all the time, you'll lag around, get de-synced or just losing the connection with everyone.\n\nReason #3\nThe global voice chat, which is mostly abused by kids screaming in the microphone. So wherever you are on the map, you will hear them. Of course there's an option to mute these people one at a time, but it's kind of annoying to have to mute 10 people every time you join a new session.\nEDIT: I've been told that you can turn the voice chat of or set it to "friends only", which is much better. But a proximity voice chat should be obvious in a game like this.\n\nIt feels like R* doesn't even care about these issues, since things just keep getting worse and worse and they don't respond with anything regarding these issues.\n\n0/10","November 26, 2015","false","134.9"," 155 of 213 people (73%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","73","155","213","14","3"

Go into passive mode, its a way to stop you from getting killed by players, but if you bump into a cop while in passive mode they will kill you and you cant do anything but run. Want money, grind your heart out or buy 200k for 5 dollars and so on up to 100 doallrs giving you over 10mil (if not 100mil).

This is due to my use of an FOV mod which allowed me to play the game without feeling physically ill from the stupidly configured FOV setting the game has by default. You can't even change it that much with the built in slider, so I was forced to use the mod which consequently resulted in my ban. This was quickly lifted by customer support when I contacted them, and will have little impact on my review, as you will see.\n\nGTA V is a great addition to the series, but does it expand and evolve the dried up formula from where GTA IV left off?\n\nWell first off let me start by saying that I have played many of the games from this series. Yes, even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ top down ones... I also have a sweet spot for Rockstar's other IPs such as Bully. But to me it seems as if RS studios are becoming dried up and running out of ideas. Instead of creating a brand new game, or expanding on the actual gameplay mechanics of their existing franchises, they decide to simply coat them in a new lick of paint and ship it for an absurd price.\n\nStory wise the game follows a Hollywood tier generic set of criminals as they try to make their big break. The voice acting of all the characters is pretty good, but this is what I expected. The amount of money Rockstar pumped into this single game is shocking, and so I'm not going to focus on the good things. If all you care are pretty visuals then sure, you kind of got them. But allow me to elaborate on why this game is actually terrible if we look at the contrast between money spent on production, and the actual end product.\n\nVisually the game may look good at first glance. I run the game maxed out using a GTX 980 accompanied with my 144hz monitor. But upon closer inspection you will notice major flaws in every aspect of the visuals. Graphically the textures in general are muddy and washed out. Don't complain that I'm not using an IPS monitor or viewing in 4K, because I own an IPS panel, and higher resolutions don't have any impact on the actual fidelity of textures, apart from making jaggies less prominent. If we compare this game to something like Metal Gear, which has very similar texture quality we can see how overrated GTA is. MGV manages to achieve similar graphical quality without the need for a £1500 rig. Infact, Rockstar didn't optimise this game at all. You know why? Because they cared too much about ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it out for last gen consoles, and then charging people again to buy a supported version that plays and looks better on current gen consoles and PCs.\n\nThe driving. A crucial part of any GTA installment, but how did they manage to take several steps back here? People complained in GTA IV that the cars drove like boats, and that it wasn't enough like mario kart. Well guess what? Cars drive like that. You can't just hop into a Ford Escort and stick to the tarmac like ♥♥♥♥ to a shoe! But being Rockstar, they had to pander to the 10 year old kids that is their main demographic. So now the cars and bikes all drive and handle like I'm playing Mario Kart.\n\nI'm not even going to elaborate on the Online features of this game. It is just a blatant attempt to milk more money from the fans that are likely to have already bought the game twice for last and current gen. Shark cards are required for low levels to even stand a chance. The fact that mods can get you banned, even ones that don't affect other people's enjoyment, such as texture overhauls, is completely stupid. Online on GTA V just seems like a kid's play area that has red tape cornering off all the swings and slides. Not to mention that it's filled with hackers and is sucking the actual game dry of content. All updates are now just content packs for GTA Online, and Rockstar outly said that there would be no DLC in the near future for solo GTA. So yeah, online mode killed this game.\n\nWould I recommend this game? No. The overhyped story and visuals got everyone hyped up. But to me it just seems like GTA IV with a slightly better PC port. The story is worse, the driving is worse, and the online is worse. This game was released purely to trick fans into handing over money repeatedly. They even bumped up the price of the game during the summer sale, so the discounted price was the same as the game normally is! It really doesn't get much worse than that does it...","May 2, 2015","false","139.7"," 2,208 of 3,356 people (66%) found this review helpful 263 people found this review funny","66","208","3","263","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/recommended/271590/","sarysa","sarysa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sarysa/","177 products in account","Single player is fantastic, so why the thumbs down?\n\nGTA Online: It turns the game into a way over-regulated sandbox. I'm going to start with modding because it's the sole reason that a large number of fans prefer to play GTA on PC as opposed to console. Private modders motivated solely by wanting to do crazy things in this big open sandbox would do just that -- create tools, sometimes even scripting languages, and such to expand previous installments to way beyond what they were. As of late May, the relationship between Rockstar and modders is tumultuous at best. Rockstar realizes that the modding community is a huge aspect of the success of PC releases, but they didn't really prepare for the modding community and it has ended up clashing with their regulated sandbox and business model, which is a hodgepodge of things that companies have been doing in the last 5 years that have worked.\n\nSo what is this regulated sandbox that I keep going on about, and why is it so flawed? Lets start with the reputation(experience) point and currency systems. Ironic coming from someone who used to be a rabid RPG fan, but experience points in an online game are a bald-faced "Skinner Box" system that gives a game artificial longevity and is essentially a mechanism for compulsion. It takes somewhere between 150 and 250 hours to hit level 120, which is where you've maxed out everything except the maximum number of armor you can carry. To get there you can go through hastily assembled missions that don't even have voice acting, heists which get old after awhile, various deathmatches, parachuting, races, and a bunch of activities that most people don't enjoy doing like tennis and golf. There are daily objectives that help speed up this leveling process, but it's just another compulsion/loyalty element as it must be performed every day.\n\nThe problem with this system, and much of it stems from the fact it takes so long to max out everything, is how imbalanced it makes the game. If you're a level 8 in a deathmatch against a level 110, you're probably going to be annihilated because the level 110 has twice as much health as you and more armor capacity, not to mention faster reload speed and less recoil. If the deathmatch is allowing inventory weapons, the imbalance gets much worse, with weapons like RPG and Heavy Sniper to contend with. Races are no better -- you cannot win a bicycle race if you lack max stamina, which allows you to pedal furiously forever. (versus about 15-20 seconds with sub-max) Handling and other aspects are affected by driving skill, and of course unlocked weapons affect the outcome of a GTA race. Custom vehicles also imbalance races. So basically, Rockstar made all this regulated PvP and yet it's completely imbalanced, and thus can't be taken seriously. It's no wonder that so many deathmatches are made simply for farming RP and cash.\n\nI go back to my artificial longevity point to mention that most people are going to pick a few things that they like -- however, no one wants to repeat the same mission over and over. Nor will most people want to get trounced in PvP by people who have no life. (irony intended) What is especially hard to stomach about all of this is that the game itself openly mocks the majority of what they're doing with their Call of Duty parody named "Righteous Slaughter 7". XP, persistent upgrades, and pay-to-win are among the things they mock...all sins that GTA Online commit.\n\nEven though this compulsion system is highly flawed, Rockstar is hard at work protecting it against the evil modders. How dare people not "earn" level 120 by shaving weeks off their lives. How dare people get money from some other source than Rockstar, to purchase roughly $30 million worth of goods that are exclusive to the online stores. There was a mass banning in early May 2015 over this. Reason? Rockstar wants you to buy their imaginary money with micropayments...much like Zynga. In fact, with price points almost lifted directly from Zynga's catalog. The highest price point is even, you guessed it, $99.99 for the whales. And let me put this into perspective...Rockstar has made roughly $3 billion from game sales alone. It's the most profitable single game ever made, and they're alienating an important part of the fan base for what surely amounts to less than 1/100th of that.\n\nNow it's worth noting that Rockstar is trying to figure out how to handle the modder issue but it's a bit too late -- the port needed to be made modder friendly from the ground up. They could have released server software and automatically have stat changes on private servers not be reflected on Rockstar servers. However, because they didn't, it's going to be some time -- probably not until GTA VI, that these issues are resolved.\n\nSo what about their own creation tools? I'll start with the video editor -- it's less flawed than the Creator, but it's only good for artsy videos. If you need to make any kind of tutorial style video, don't even bother. The caption length is too short, the caption placement handling is awkward, and the text editor for captions lacks basic features like clicking between letters and having the cursor go there. The Creator is very flawed. In overhead mode, it can be very difficult to place checkpoints on hills. If you want to place any objects in midair, you need to spend many hours manipulating the very fine time/space windows allowed for this kind of placement. Even though some of the most popular community maps use this, Rockstar hasn't embraced it and has kept it limited. There's also a profanity filter that's so poorly written that words like "Sniper" and "Skyscraper" get filtered out of descriptions. It's virtually impossible to promote your maps and there's a glut of maps due to there being mini-achievements for publishing a map and having it played. It's possible for maps to be viewed as "corrupted" and need to be made from scratch -- it's happened to two of my crew. Finally, once you publish a map, any time you go to update it, you can't save a local copy without making a brand new duplicate -- it won't update for anyone who has bookmarked the old version. (and the editor will crash, a lot, even on low settings)\n\nThis aspect didn't fit in anywhere else, but the online loading times are terrible -- it can take over a minute to load into a Freemode game.\n\nWith all the complaining in this review, which might be viewed as unfair, I need to contrast this game with TF2. Valve has embraced the modding community with all its Source games, including TF2 -- Rockstar is struggling with it in GTA V. In TF2, players pay real world money for cosmetics that don't affect gameplay, while in GTA V, real world money is used for an in-game advantage. TF2 -does- charge for weapons, but these weapons are easily acquired via trading or random drops, far easier than in GTA V. (but it's only fair to point out TF2's one sin) TF2's hammer tool is frankly superior to Rockstar's Creator, though I can only fairly compare the interface, speed, and how much potential time is lost due to errors with the software. AlliedModders, a fan-made company, handles all the other aspects of TF2 modding -- and they do it well, because they care. TF2 lets fans run servers and Valve only very lightly interferes with the management of these servers. (entirely related to paid cosmetics, which is fair) GTA V isn't there yet, and may never be there. TF2 has balanced PvP, GTA V does not. GTA V has artificial longevity through Skinner Box methods, while TF2's longevity is a product of a solid base, along with the company working along side its community. It should be no wonder that GTA's been slowly losing players and will soon be overtaken by the aging TF2.\n\nI write this scathing review not to bash GTA V, but in the hopes that it will be read, and will influence the development of GTA VI. GTA's overall fan base is enormous -- hopefully Rockstar will get it right in the next installment.","May 31, 2015","false","358.7"," 197 of 281 people (70%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","70","197","281","9","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/recommended/271590/","scares","Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scares/","666 products in account","I waited a while to write this, mainly because I wanted to find quite a bit to write about. Nevertheless, after 100+ hours, I feel this game can be thoughtfully and precisely judged, more inportantly on all aspects of the game. I'll be dividing this review into two categories: Single Player and Multiplayer. Let's begin.\n\nSingle Player:\nSingle player starts off with the characters Michael and Trevor. Finishing a heist job from the North Yankton bank, they decide this is the last and final score. Yet, not all good things end well. They end up getting caught, and one of their crew members die. Trevor escapes, and that's where the story begins.\nNext and final playable character is introduced, named Franklin. Franklin is a petty thief, who is hired by Simeon (a local car dealsman) to reposess cars at the owners expense, although the reposession is not so to speak authorised. One day, Franklin gets the order to "repo" the car of a teenager, and upon arrival, Franklin is met with a seemingly rich family. After successfully lifting the car, Franklin drives away cheerfully, not knowing Michael is in the back seat. After pursuading Franklin to drive through Simeons shop, Michael makes a deal with him to make some "real" cash, thus involving Franklin in a series of robberies and other heists. Once word gets out Michael is "back in the scene", his old colleague Trevor finds out, who is furious because he thought Micheal died all those years back.\n\nThat's pretty much the story. You rob a few banks, make some cash. The story is quite well and fun, I found no aspects to complain about, and even had hours of enjoyment playing through it. I actually wish it was longer, or a Single Player DLC was introduced which involved the main characters after the robberies. Even though side missions and such could count as this, I wanted more along the lines of the main story.\n\nAll in all, the game is pretty much (in it's current state) only worth it for the story. The reason why is in Multiplayer.\n\n\nMultiplayer:\nJesus Christ. Multiplayer is a ♥♥♥♥ing mess.\n\nJust to name a few problems:\n-Hackers. The ♥♥♥♥ers will infinitely shoot rockets at everyone until their dead, or at least until you want to turn on passive mode and ruin your experience.\n-"DLC". With the addition of some well planned DLC, "cash cards" or microtransactions of in-game currency became available. The only reason I have a problem with this is that the ones that are worth anything at all (meaning the money from the card can't be made in 20 minutes time) are more than what the game is actually sold for. Yes, that's right. The developers are selling in-game money for $50 or even $100 real money. Not to mention this was the spawn of their genius Summer Sale idea to innitially discount the game 40%, only to remove the listing, add a Shark Card to it and stick it up as 40% off, but still cost the regular $60. ♥♥♥♥ move Rockstar.\n-Foreigners. I, myself, find me to be a very multicultured person. I don't mind at all anyone of a different nationality, only when it hinders my gameplay. Example: I'm still sort of new to the whole online mode of this game, so I often ask for hints during team modes such as heists. So, I was put into a lobby of non-english speakers for a heist, so I thought, okay, I can do this, I just have to fly a plane. I get the plane, go to the area, now I have to evade jets. No big deal. After flying around for 20 minutes with literally nothing happening, the team finally gets their ♥♥♥♥ together, and I can pick them up. I fly off, and we are supposed to lose the cops. My other pilot (who has the missles to shoot down the cops helicopters so we can get away faster) decides he's going to take a break, and lands at the beach. I fly around for maybe 20 more minutes, trying desperately to get these cops to go away, and even when there were none around for miles they somehow still found me. After I finally get them to go away, I now just have to drop them off. Somehow, my experienced skills did not tell me I have to stall my ♥♥♥♥ing plane in the sky about 200 meters up just do drop the ♥♥♥♥ers off, so I spent about another 10 minutes flying around screaming what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on??? Then, my genius teammates start screaming at me "FLY TALL". Any English speaker will not know what the ♥♥♥♥ that means, so when someone says fly tall, that literally sounds like nonsense. So, other helicopter guy decides his 15 minute break is up, starts flying upwards into the air, so I decided to follow. The game goes to the cutscene, and we all jump out. After 2 seconds, screen comes up the guy we broke out died. I left the game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, online can be some fun, and by that I mean if you have passive mode enabled or are in a solo session. Multiplayer is literally ♥♥♥♥ing cancer. Just avoid it at all costs.","January 1","false","127.2"," 133 of 183 people (73%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","73","133","183","24","34"

A solid 2 out of every 3 sessions has a miserable kid with a mod menu, endlessly spawning NPCs, fire, explosions, and other annoying entities on the players. And of course Rockstar introduced online challenges-- mini games which pit the players head-to-head to win a cash reward. Naturally, if you're close to winning, you'll be any modder's main target. This awful infestation of cheaters has made the game outright frustrating to play with others, something that GTA is meant to be about.\n\nDespite the unfortunate multiplayer environment, the game remains very solid in private sessions and singleplayer game modes. More unfortunately, however, is the fact that public multiplayer is the game mode most people want to play-- therefore I can't recommend this game in it's current, toxic state.","November 24, 2015","false","94.5"," 102 of 137 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","102","137","7","3"

However, Rockstar is still actively against community driven efforts to enhance the game. PC version could have benefitted greatly from online mods but Rockstar wants to push its Macro-Transaction Shark cards on everyone which can total upwards of $100, then gimp the gameplay rewards and up the prices of everything and call it "balanced". Had there not been huge micro/macro-transactions in the game we could have seen dedicated servers and huge potential for an online modding community. We could have had an amazing open world open modded online game that could rival Just Cause 2 multiplayer, Minecraft, Garry's Mod, and countless many others that benefitted from an active modding community but instead we just get Social Club DRM and an obsession over controlling virtual money. Try to increase the FOV in First Person Mode online because you have motion sickness? That's a ban. Have a hacker come on and shoot you with billions of dollars? That's a ban. Try to mod in an expansive GTA Online RPG experience with custom modes, mods, and custom settings? That's a perma-ban. Don't want to grind for 600 hours to buy a single car? That's $100 from your wallet. What you'd expect to see in a Free 2 Play / Pay 2 Win game is now in full-fledged $60 titles.

It really feels this game is taking PC gaming to its limits, so if you have a solid rig to run it then you will find here one of the best looking and most technically impressive games for PC ever. Having a system capable of running this beast on ultra-settings will make you think that all your hardware is being put to the test and that your investment was totally worth it.\nI’m very happy with this version, yes the PC version is awesome and everything is almost flawless.\nAs a good sandbox this open world has literally tons of things to do, it feels huge!\nCoop is really fun and amazing, with lots of unlockable missions, races, heists, sports, shopping, activities, and a lot more to do, plus they keep adding more and more content.\nThe story mode is well developed and it has funny characters (in their own GTA way). The humor is satirical and politically incorrect (as it should be in a -rated M- GTA). At first I thought the idea of having 3 characters simultaneously was strange and probably not good, but when you play it you realize it works really well.\nGameplay wise, driving is well implemented, intuitive and feels natural,  shooting, swimming, running and moving around are too. The game is cool as it is on 3d person already, but it adds the bonus of a 1st person experience, you can switch on the go and it’s really nice too. And with so many types of vehicles, ground, air and sea, and a lot of guns at your disposal, it never feels repetitive or boring. I love clothing and shopping, I have spent hours in the clothing stores, shopping is fun!\nOn the sound department the effects are stunning and I love the soundtrack!, a lot of GTA V songs now are part of my personal playlists.\nIn general a lot of attention was given to every little detail. This is basically a masterpiece and a perfect game, simply one of the very best games there are for PC. Justice has been served for PC gamers and the wait was very much worth. I absolutely love it.\nSo once again, if you don’t have it yet, what are you waiting for?, you should be playing it right now instead of being here reading this.\nSee ya in Los Santos!\n\n\nVayamos al grano: GTA V es uno de los mejores juegos de siempre, ve y consíguelo de inmediato!.\nAhora si quieres saber  más, entonces  vamos a expandirlo un poco más.\nEl juego es divertido, realmente solido en todos los sentidos, los controles y jugabilidad están bien implementados y son responsivos.\nEn el lado técnico, tiene unas gráficas y efectos realmente asombrosos y hermosos, la ciudad luce preciosa, la campiña, las zonas desérticas, los bosques, las playas, las montañas, etc., son todos increíbles.\nEl océano es lo que más me impresionó, en mi opinión es lo más sobresaliente, se siente muy realista y cuando te paras cerca de la orilla sientes que los videojuegos nunca más volverán a ser iguales si un mar virtual puede ser tan sobrecogedor. Realmente se siente como este juego está llevando los videojuegos de PC a sus límites, así que si tienes un equipo sólido para correrlo, entonces descubrirás aquí uno de los más vistosos juegos y también uno de los más impresionantes a nivel técnico para PC jamás logrado. El tener una PC capaz de correr esta bestia en ultra	 te hará sentir que todo tu equipo está siendo puesto a prueba y que tu inversión ha valido la pena.\nEstoy muy feliz con esta versión, la versión de PC es increíble y casi todo es impecable.\nComo buen sandbox este mundo abierto tiene literalmente montones de cosas que hacer, ¡se siente enorme!.\nEl cooperativo es realmente divertido e increíble, con muchas misiones desbloqueables, carreras, golpes, deportes, compras, actividades y más por hacer, además le agregan a menudo más y más contenido.\nEl modo de historia está bien desarrollado y posee personajes divertidos (muy a la manera de GTA). El humor es satírico y políticamente incorrecto (como debe ser en un - Clasificación M – GTA). Al principio pensé que la idea de tener 3 personajes simultáneos era extraña y probablemente no muy buena, pero cuando juegas te das cuenta de que funciona muy bien.\nA nivel de jugabilidad , la conducción está bien implementada, es intuitiva y se siente natural, disparar, nadar, correr y moverte por todos lados lo son también. El juego es genial así, pero  agrega el bono de una experiencia en primera persona, puedes cambiar en cualquier momento y también es genial. A esto agrégale que con tantos vehículos de tierra, aire y agua y con montones de armas a tu disposición, nunca lo sentirás repetitivo o aburrido.\nA mí me encanta la ropa e ir de compras, he pasado horas en las tiendas de ropa, ¡ir de compras es divertido!\nEn el departamento de sonido los efectos son maravillosos y ¡me encanta el soundtrack!, muchas de las canciones de GTA V ahora forman parte de mis listas de reproducción personales.\nEn general  le pusieron bastante atención a cada pequeño detalle. Esto es básicamente una obra maestra y un juego perfecto, simplemente uno de los mejores juegos que hay para PC. Se le hizo justicia a los gamers de PC y la espera valió la pena. Yo lo adoro, este debe ser la edición definitiva de GTA V.\nAsí que una vez más, si aún no lo tienes, ¿que estas esperando?, deberías estar jugándolo justo ahora en lugar de estar aquí leyendo esto.\n¡Nos vemos en Los Santos!","September 28, 2015","true","632.7"," 346 of 518 people (67%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","67","346","518","52","42"

Why?\n\n1- because once you finish the story mode you have nothing left to do if you're not interested in online mode. Seriously, it's so boring to wait for contacts to call you for help. Playing golf, tennis, etc is nice ....... 3 times then it's just boring.\n2- because online is infested by whining kids and uneducated brats. And no, going in private session is not a solution if you're interested in joining activities as you won't get any notification of any activity. Boring.\n3- online servers are the most shity things ever! You spend 50% of your time on loading screens. For example, me. I played almost 800H (I'll come back to why later) but in fact, on these 800H I spent about 400H waiting while watching a fuc*ing laoding screen. By the way, you're lucky if you don't regularly see the message "Loading time too long, back to GTA, try again later to join GTA Online." or if you're not simply ejected from activities or lobbies because Rockstar servers had a stuttering problem. And no it has nothing to do with my connection as I play on other online games and never had any problem, only with GTA.\n4- online is boring as hell if you are not interested in doing the same activities again and again and again and don't have a crew to have fun with. Back to my almost 800H of game: Yeah, it's a lot, but it's only because around 300H, when I was ready to give up on the game out of boredom I MET PEOPLE FROM A CREW WITH WHOM I NOW HAVE A LOT OF FUN.\n5- cheaters everywhere! And a lot a script kiddies who think they are hte best hackers in the world (even if they don't even know how to spell hacker, and even less how to hack) and who spend their time ruining the game for everyone because Rock* don't give a sh*t about them and is only interested in people spawning money bags because they think it influences the sell of their shark cards (as if anyone with two braincells would buy a shark card... oh wait, there are in fact people buying them, go figure...)\n\nSo now, let's go to the positive points of the game...... Wait, I search some...... I know there are some great things in this game..... Be patient, I'll find one or two...... Hum, oh, maybe that:\n1- it's GTA! Yeah, GTA games are always good, come on, you know, you love it. Great maps, huge open world, strange humour always funny, nice radio stations and possibility to make your own, nice cars, nice guns, nice races, nice missions, ...\n2- if you find a crew, and by that I mean a real crew with people you can interact with, not the IGN crew where they are hundreds and nobody talks to anybody, they don't even play together, it's just to be in the IGN crew, well, as I said, if you find a real crew, then GTA can be the most entertaining game of the moment.\n3- hum, sorry, I can't think of anything else good in that game.\n\nSo, is that game good? Yes because it's GTA and no because it's way too ♥♥♥♥ed up. Would I recommend it? Yes if you have friends playing it or find yourself a nice crew. If you answered no to any (or both) of these questions, then prepare yourself for  a world or boredom.","April 25","false","793.0"," 113 of 156 people (72%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","72","113","156","15","9"

There's so much to discuss, so let's make a list.\n\nPros:\n\n-Enjoyable/memorable single-player\n\n-Multiplayer isn't complete trash*\n\n-Customization of vehicles is in depth in GTAO and GTAV\n\n-Player character customization in GTAO is rough, but allows for good custom characters\n\n-Ability of a "passive mode" in case you're tired of the killing\n\n*Cons:\n\n-"Hackers" are everywhere\n\n-Toxic community (Entitled people are a commodity in this game)\n\n-Weapon scaling system based on level\n\n-Grindy ways to gain money\n\n-Absurd in-game prices\n\n-Horrible damage scaling for weapons\n\n-OP "End-Game" unlocks\n\n-No server browser (You'll be put in games with people of all backgrounds and countries)\n\nEnding Notes:\nThis list could go on and on. Personally, I find GTAV and GTAO enjoyable, but Rockstar's made some rather dumb choices in the multiplayer. When I mentioned the level based weapon system, the higher the level you are, the stronger the weapons you can purchase, thus more damage. While this system is seen in many games, GTAV does it in the worse way with the addition of purchasable tanks, jets equipped with homing rockets, bulletproof vehicles that are only purchasable after you do certain in-game missions, and a lot more. As hacking gets more and more aggressive and the community becomes more and more toxic, mostly due to people who are either too young to play the game or have anger problems, it certainly makes you think differently. While I may not be able to sway you with my opinion, I just highly recommend that you don't purchase this game until Rockstar can find a way to balance higher end purchasables and make it a better experience for all players.","May 26","false","229.0"," 80 of 108 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","80","108","7","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrStrangePool/recommended/271590/","DrStrangePool","Dr. Strangepool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrStrangePool/","381 products in account","Rockstar, has once again made a classic but the classic is getting muddled with company policy.\n\nRight now, they are banning people with mods, some reports of them done from single player. Constant patching to stop any sort of modding. Couldn't they just make a separate version of Single Player and Online, so the online version doesn't load anything? Nope.\n\nThen the constant issues and bad optimization. Crashes, can't load, stuck on loading screens, bad support, exceptionally constricting FOV (and attempts to make the mod invalid) that makes you puke, memory leaks, memory leaks, memory leaks, memory leaks, did I mention memory leaks? Well, memory leaks, lots of it!\n\nSince GTAIV, Rockstar has been a disaster on the PC scene, not releasing Red Dead Redemption, to shoddy ports like this. I would have assumed that they might have learned how bad GTAIV was when released due to performance issues, and being a crappy port. Nope, they didn't learn a thing! Delays after delays and they released another shoddy port.\n\nWhat sort imbecile creates an FOV with such restrictive options?! I loved the idea of the First Person perspective, but after throwing up TWICE, I gave up using it. The last time I had an issue with FOV was with Half-Life 2 when they changed FOV between FPS and vehicle use to simulate speed.\n\nI also assumed, due to the extreme time it took to get this out to PC that they would at least figure out that some peripherals, like a Rudder or a Joystick can't be used for typing. But if you do own any of them, especially a rudder pedal, when you type your login details in the horrid idea of a social club, it won't allow you to. It will pop-up a virtual keyboard, requiring you to use the rudder so it allows you to type on the keyboard.\n\nNot only that, some textures look washed out, or blurry. Where are the High Definition textures you get in games like Shadows of Mordor?\n\nFor a classic to be sullied by bad policies like this, is truly saddening.

In GTA V you explore a huge open world as three very different criminals. What you do is up to you as Los Santos and Blaine County offer a wide variety of activities, legal and not so legal, on the side of main missions, heists and side missions. Los Santos and Blaine County are not only explored through our three story protagonists, you can also take to the streets, sea and sky with a custom created character usable in both the Online game modes and the Director mode.\n\nSpeaking of game modes, GTA V has three main modes. First off, we have the afore mentioned story mode featuring our three lovable criminals, there's not much to say about this one apart from what's already been said. Secondly, we have GTA Online where you can complete jobs and participate in other activities with friends and others using a character you create. Lastly, we have the Director Mode which allows you to play as any of the characters found in Los Santos and Blaine County as well as giving you access to a number of cheats, this game mode is designed to be used with the Rockstar Editor to create short films/videos.\n\nBefore I continue with my review I just want to point out I also have around 150 hours of game time on Xbox 360 on top of my PC game time.\n\n+Fantastic graphics, even if you aren't running the game on ultra this game looks fantastic\n+Excellent gameplay, from driving to flying to the game's gunplay, everything feels satisfying and reasonably realistic (by this I do not mean it feels like it would in the real world, rather it simply does not feel fake)\n+A good, engaging story with excellently made characters\n+As mentioned earlier the game world is huge\n+Fantastic voice acting, particularly the three protagonists\n+A rather large array of weapons to choose from, each with a number of purchasable attachments and cosmetic changes\n+A variety of settings to be seen throughout the game world\n+Numerous different radio stations available while driving each with a fair few songs as well as the ability to create your own radio station with your own songs\n+A huge number of vehicles ranging from mopeds to jet airliners, most land vehicles have a number of upgrades and paintjobs available\n+A number of different camera angles in vehicles and on foot including a first person camera which is an awesome edition to the game\n+Several activities to take part in outside of missions such as racing, tennis, golf and more\n+Lots of clothes, tattoos and several hairstyles available for the protagonists and your online character\n+Already a number of mods available (I'll return to mods later)\n+Rockstar have released quite a bit of free content since the release of GTA V\n+GTA V comes with an intergrated video recorder and editor which allows you to create short films/videos with relative ease. The Rockstar editor can also be used to create beautiful screenshots of the game using frames from a recorded video and then adding filters to them\n+A lot of GTA Online missions\n+Controls are great (played with a Gamepad)\n\n-The Online character creator isn't particularly good and doesn't give you much control over your character's features\n-Open lobbies in Online are absolutely filled with hackers and if the hackers effect your character in anyway you run the risk of being banned by Rockstar\n-If you leave your mods enabled when you enter GTA Online you run the risk of being banned, this means you have to go to the effort of disabling mods everytime you wish to switch between SP and MP\n-Rockstar used some questionable business practices during the Steam Summer Sale, it didn't effect me as I already owned the game but I feel it was worth mentioning\n-GTA Online uses Rockstar's Social Club DRM rather than Steamworks which is not only frustrating because it means going through another DRM, it also means Online relies on Rockstar's servers which have had a number of issues\n-Loading times are awful, I've only seen one game that has longer loading times than GTA V\n-Getting RP (basically XP) and Money in Online requires a ridiculous amount of grinding and in Online money really does buy happiness which makes this irritating\n\nVerdict:\nAn Essential Purchase (9.5/10)\n\nGTA V, particularly Online, does have its issues but when it comes to Open World freedom and enjoyment nothing comes close. With fantastic graphics, excellent gameplay, lots of weapons, lots of vehicles and a huge world this really is not a game you should pass up on.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews\n\nEl K.","July 7, 2015","true","132.7"," 139 of 209 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","139","209","9","18"

So I hope that my review will be quite objectively. Please feel free to leave a comment or discuss issues with me. After playing GTA V more than 300 hours I think now it´s time to discuss buisness!\n\nPROS:\n-The singleplayer in this game is awesom .... there is so much you can do that you will have fun for many hours and more.\n-The storry from singleplayer is great, good redline through the game with lot´s of fun missions and great heists.\n-Graphics on high end PC are quite nice, could have been better :D\n-Fantastic ambience throughout the whole world ! AMAZING !\n-Masterpiece of soundtrack! The radiostations in this game are really good and have something to offer for almost every taste of music!\n-Great sarcasm and lots of eastereggs and funstuff to find or collect.\n-TV and Internet ... all thumbs up :D\n\nCONS:\n-The multiplayer!!! (I have waited sooo long to play a GTA game in actual multiplayer together with friends and puplic people! but it is impossible)\n-Permanent laggy gamesessions.\n-Connection errors all the time.\n-Friends getting kicked out of invite only sessions permanently!\n-Hours of loading screens!!!! (I´m running this game on high end PC with SSD drive and still loading for hours)\n-very low payout rate of money! (a friend played GTA V on PS3 and told me that the payouts were way better back in the days ... so they nerfed the payouts down after releasing heists! it takes really long to save up for something big like hydra or whatever) which takes me to my next point ...\n-HACKERS!!! The damn game is full with hackers .... everywhere!!! Rockstar doesn´t seem to do a lot against them because they are everywhere at any time!!!! jumped through 5 puplic lobbies, encountered 7 hackers.\nbreaking the whole realm, shooting moneybags or cars out of their weapons, teleporting with godmode, screwing up other peoples clients so that they get banned instead of the true hacker! I`M SICK OF THEM ....I ALSO AM SICK OF ♥♥♥♥♥ PLAYERS JOINING THE LOBBIES ... FIRST QUESTION ASKED: Is there a hacker here, I need money!!! WTF ... such a-holes should be banned too, right from the moment they typed in this question! Don´t missunderstand me here, I HAVE A 0 TOLERANCE POLICY FOR HACKERS! They ruin everybodys game expierience!!! And people who abuse hacking methods for their own good are the same scum in my opinion!\n\nLast words:\nI really love the game and I will continue to play it, but i´m not sure if i will give the multiplayer another chance!\nI will also give the game a good review because the game itself is a fantastic masterpiece of game design!\nThe multiplayer will get all thumbs down from me :D\nROCKSTAR PLEASE SOLVE THE HACKER PROBLEM!!!\n\nI would totally recommend GTA V to everybody. BUT, be aware of the multiplayer!\nMaybe wait a year or so until it will be on a steam sale for half of the actual price! You will totally not regret buying it then!\n\nBest regards\nBoudewijn IJzenarm","June 22, 2015","true","491.8"," 115 of 170 people (68%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","68","115","170","16","17"

(I forget how many neon signs I found with transmisogynistic slurs on them, but I know theres a few, which is a few too many.) So, yeah, you know. It's GTA, as per usual. Offensive just to be offensive, without any actual social commentary.\nIf you ignore every other line of dialogue and 75% of the text, you'll find a fun game. If you can't tune out garbage writing and bad characterization, you'll find out why these people are writing puns for shop signs and too-often repeated lines for npcs in video games instead of working on their third internationally acclaimed novel.\nI really don't know if I do or do not recommend this game, to be honest. I'd like a "this sure is a video game that exists and some people might like" option, but I guess I'll have to settle for a yes or no.\n\nYes, if you intend to play both single player and online, for at least 200 hours. Or, if you have friends to play it with, who also want to play online for at least 200 hours.\n\nBut, if you want to play through the story, just rent it on a console or pirate it, honestly. If you could play gta online without paying full price for the game, I'd recommend you do that, because $60 for a game that is, in essence, that older guy on the back of a school bus, pretending to be cool and telling bad jokes to twelve year olds because they're the only ones who'll laugh?

Which is horrible considering the guys at FiveM and GTA:MP, with extremely limited resources, built (or tried to build) a better product than Rockstar Games did with GTA Online.\n\nSingle Player does not appeal after being beaten once and GTA Online is saturated with issues and there is nothing to do after 50-100 hours. Yes, you can (try to) have fun with friends in a private session, if all goes well. But thats just not enough.\n\nI hope someone at Take Two Interactive realises that mods prolong the life of a game on PC. For example, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Even after 5 years, its still one of the top selling games. Even Rockstar Games' own Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which is still active even after more than a decade has passed since its release. This is because of the mods (SA:MP and MTA:SA). Also take a look at Just Cause 2. They have an official Multiplayer Mod which is infact built by the community.\n\nThis is probably the last game I ever pre-ordered, and definitely the last game I will buy from Take Two Interactive, atleast at the full price.

Now, on with a bit of an extension to my original review.\n\nSo, after many hours troubleshooting, messing with files, uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, (and yes, my PC can run this game at very high settings at 60fps, so don't even go on about the "ur computer be sh!t m8!") I was fed up with running this game, only to experience constant crashing, and dishonest players. Rockstar delayed this game for many months, and while the port seems well optimized, there is a community outcry of hackers, crashing, and other various bugs that even prevents the launch of Grand Theft Auto V. The game(for those who can open it) essentially launches, and within 20min of playing online, or off, the game would freeze and crash. After paying 60$, and waiting on the "GTA V optimized" drivers from nvidia, I was generally discouraged by these issues. In addition, there is bugs with the disappearance of cars, trouble with game keys being used by players, and required again, and serious texture errors that cripples the experience I love from playing GTA.\n\nSo, in closing, the game itself is fantastic, and I would highly recommend you buy it...after a few patches, banning of hackers, and on a steam sale (I'm saving you from becoming a "bad sport" in multiplayer from crashing 24/7, trust me :D).\n\n350.1 "Patch" Notes(4/30/15)\n-The game now lags and microstutters even harder!(new 10fps to 60fps jumps added!)\n-Textures flash blue/disappear sometimes,\n-People are getting randomly banned from GTA: Online!\n-The game freezes and says "FATAL ERROR: Unrecoverable Fault", rather than Err_gfx_d3d_init!\nCongrats Rockstar, you made 10 steps back with last "patch", and now this "patch" you decided to say "ahhh, f*ck it" and sprint back 100 steps!\n\nIF YOU HAVE A FIX, FEEL FREE TO POST IT IN THE COMMENTS FOR NOT ONLY ME, BUT FOR THE COMMUNITY.

I enjoyed my time in Los Santos just as much as anyone else although I feel that there's so much to praise and criticize Rockstar on with this product that all of it can't fit inside the confines of this review.\n\nAspects of Grand Theft Auto V Worth Praising\n● Interesting Selection of Licensed Music. It wouldn't be a Grand Theft Auto title without a wide range of unique music to listen to, would it? You certainly have to give credit to Rockstar for their unique selection of licensed music in their game!\n\n● The Introduction of The Rockstar Editor. Not many developers have ever took the time to create a content creation tool such as the Rockstar Editor. This tool provides seemingly limitless opportunities for videos and screenshots.\n\n● The Ability To Approach Combat Situtations In Multiple Ways. You have stealth mechanics, silencers, fragmentation mines and sticky bombs along with the ability to use your weapons while parachuting at your disposal.\n\n● The Ability To Add Custom Music Via Self Radio. Although Grand Theft Auto V doesn't give you any way to listen to your music on-foot, you at least have the ability to add your own custom songs just as in previous titles through Self Radio.\n\n● The Feature To Replay Missions. In previous Grand Theft Auto titles you had no way to re-experience missions once you've completed them. This time around Rockstar has implemented the feature to replay missions! It allows you to re-experience mission and aspire towards a 100% gold rating through weapon accuracy and various mission specific objectives.\n\n● The Feature To Save Whenever, Wherever. In previous Grand Theft Auto titles the only way you could save was to go to your safehouse or apartment. This time around you can quick save straight through your phone!\n\n● Online Character Customization. Grand Theft Auto V offers hundreds of unique articles of clothing including hats, earings, glasses, armor, shirts, pants, shoes and a multitude of other accessories to customize your online character with.\n\nAspects of Grand Theft Auto V Worth Criticizing\n● First Person Field of View Limitations. The "First Person On Foot Field of View" slider isn't labeled in any way and is extremely narrow. There is no way to increase your first person field of view in a vehicle.\n\n● Failure To Update Single Player Alongside Online. You can't purchase car insurance, call for vehicle delivery for your vehicles or purchase apartments in single player. If you take your car out on a mission or it gets destroyed, it's gone forever.\n\n● No Way To Listen To Music On Foot. Unfortunately, it's always been this way in every Grand Theft Auto title. This leads people to favor motorized vehicle transportation and procrastinate longer than they should as they don't want to leave the vehicle they're in. For a game that takes place in 2013 you would think you have the ability to purchase a pair of earbuds at the gas station and use your phone to listen to the radio or purchase music with in-game money on an iFruit app, but no.\n\n● Unskippable Introduction & 30FPS Loading Screen Limit. There is no way to skip the introduction in the beginning of the game and it's locked to 30 frames per second. Most don't mind waiting 30 or more seconds every time they start the game but all of those seconds certainly stack up, especially if your game crashes often. As for the frame rate restriction, the only limitation that should affect a loading screen's performance should be your hardware but that unfortunately isn't the case in Grand Theft Auto V. Some people can't handle going from 80, 120, 144 or higher frame rates to 30.\n\n● Franklin, Michael and Trevor Will Always Change Their Clothes. When ever you first load into single player, switch characters or return from multiplayer, your character will have their clothes reset every time. Some don't care, but some inviduals painstakingly customize their character only to have it reset. This doesn't affect your online character however.\n\nAspects of Grand Theft Auto Online Worth Criticizing\n● The Quantity of Online Missions Is Lacking. While Rockstar may continually increase the amount of items you can purchase with the money you earn, they don't bother themselves increasing the amount of missions you can earn money from. Not all missions are created equal so Grand Theft Auto V Online can turn into a grind fest very quickly.\n\n● No Way To Change Your Online Character's Appearance! Once you first go online you have one opportunity to customize your character's facial and racial features. If you screw up or are unsatisfied with your character, you're out of luck. You would think in Hollywood you would have the ability to get plastic surgery, but that simply isn't the case in Grand Theft Auto V Online.\n\n● Poor Player Management & Connection Issues. Players are segregated based on their targeting mode preferences in the "gamepad" settings menu. Assisted Aim is set as default thus every other gamemode on any other preference is never full and players will constantly leave. You have to continulessly leave to find a new session and at times you'll randomly disconnect from everyone else.\n\n● Vague Restrictions on Online Modifications. Unlike Grand Theft Auto IV, users who modify their game files are no longer seperated from the rest of the population, and they have a chance at being banned. Rockstar is purposely vague on what is and isn't allowed online, only claiming they go after people who use mods to gain an advantage on others. Many thousands of players freely use texture and mesh replacements online but due to Rockstar's vague responses, it's at your own risk.\n\nDRM Restrictions & Business Decisions Worth Criticizing\n● Social Club Digital Rights Management Restrictions! Steam owners of Grand Theft Auto V can't play unless they're signed into a Rockstar Social Club account and it's launched through Steam. These restrictions only affect people who have legally purchased this product.\n\n● Online Progress Not Saved Locally! Because everything you do online is tied to the Social Club service and not any sort of offline save file that you can backup for future use or load into individual user hosted servers, 10, 20, or 30 years from now when they're not raking in enough money to keep their servers afloat, all the ranks you achieved and money you earned or payed for would have been for nothing.\n\n● Inability To Change License Plate In-Game! Instead of adding the feature to change your license plate in-game, Rockstar decided to outsource this feature to a third party app called "iFruit." This app is only available on Google Play, the Apple or Windows app store.\n\n● Returning Players & Event Exclusive Content! Those who were present during the multitude of exclusive events throughout the end of 2013 and 2014 on the console versions of Grand Theft Auto V were awarded exclusive weapons, vehicles and articles of clothing. It's debatable if you truly need to criticize Rockstar for doing this because to some it represents an appreciation for the alpha and beta testers of Grand Theft Auto V. For some, it's a painful pill to swallow knowing that there's items they're never going to be able to obtain because they either waited for the PC release or are a newcomer.","August 8, 2015","true","414.0"," 52 of 68 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","52","68","10","0"

(L.S.) to near perfection. Having been to the actual city several times, I could easily recognize landmarks and accurate streets while in game. The Viper Roorm, Ripley's Believe It or Not museum, The Scientology Center are all here plus lots more albeit renamed but the structures remain the same.\n\nWhen the sun sets and rises, all of the lighting is accurate and at times, absolutley beautiful especially when the light rays are breaking around Mt. Chiliad and when storms roll through the desert or in the cities, it's some of the best weather FX I've seen in a game because it feels real. Roads gradually get wetter the more it rains and lightning illuminates everything when it crashes.\n\nIt truly feels like a living world.\n\n-The Satire\nWhat I feel is one of the strongest points of the game is how it shows no mercy towards the vapid lifestyle that's so prevalent in L.A. across all social classes. The rich are just as shallow as the poor in their life goals and in a very cathartic and some would say sadistic way, it's never been more fun to mow down socialite trash in the hills or go on a rampage down in the ghetto.\n\nThe signage and radio commercials are also perfect, knocking everything from politics to the video game industry itself. This can keep a person driving around just looking at billboards and movie posters and listening to the varied radio stations.\n\n-The Characters\nThere are many who dislike the characters, especially Trevor and I can see why but I liked them because of how they played off of one another. Michael, the would be retiree who's juggling family problems. Franklin, a young man growing up in the hood, doing what needs to be done but also having some kind of conscience and a want to get out of his current lifestyle. Trevor, the manic fiend throws all caution to the wind and is the vulgar but free spirit, taking pride in his insanity but also has some insightful moments along the journey.\n\nNone of the characters generate any real kind of sympathy but they're all believable and kept me wanting to play to see how things end up for each of them.  The voice actors do an A+ job in bringing them and the secondary characters to life.\n\n-The First Person Mode\nNot only is this one of the best 3rd person games ever made, it's also one of the best FPS's in years. Being able to take in the entirety of the world and action through the eyes of each character really brings the world to life and the shooting is super smooth in both 3rd and 1st person modes.\n\n-The Radio Stations\nThere's nothing like blasting through neighboorhoods or driving off cliffs while rocking "We Built This City" by Starship or "Heartbeat" by Don Johnson.  If you like pop, rock, country, rap, trance or even talk radio, there's something here for anyone to like.\n\nDislikes:\n\n-The Police\nThey seem overly aggresive and I don't know if that's a play on the LAPD or not but there have been time that I've simply pointed a gun at someone and got swarmed by 4 cop cars in less than 5 seconds. Also while in a car, I've been clear of their field of view with no chopper in the air and parked in the most secluded hiding spot I could find only to have them pinpoint my location and jump the walls to get me.\n\n-The Storefronts\nI just wish there were more of them that could be entered and explored but I also know how much of a challenge this would be in an already huge world. I'd be happy if they would have an arcade somewhere with a few playable classic games.\n\n-The Sub and the Helicopter\nFor me, the sub missions are the biggest weakness in story mode. The model looks cool but is just dull and not much fun to drive and thankfully main missions with it are few. The helicopter, while fun, could have the controls refined a bit more to make it more fluid especially when trying to pinpoint certain targets. Thankfully Rockstar is fairly lenient when it comes to this.\n\n-Real Time Destruction\nAgain, like the storefronts, I know how much it would take to have this throughout the world and we'd probably be lucky to get 10-30 frames per second with Phys-X cranked up but it would be a sight to behold bringing down one of the contruction sites or collapsing an overpass at will. Something about shooting a rocket at a building and only leaving scuff marks really removes me from the game in those moments.\n\n-Extra Activities\nGiven the sun and sand vibe of L.S.(L.A.), I wish that you could surf and skateboard. Seeing a skateshop as well as a skatepark and half pipes and only being able to ride them with a bmx bike left me slightly gnashing my teeth.\n\nThat's not to say they couldn't add these things in a dlc pack, (fingers crossed) but I just find theior absence strange and overlooked.\n\nThose nitpicks aside, this is still one of the best games I've played in a very long time and, with so much to do, I'll be playing it for the rest of the year and beyond and smiling the whole time.\n\nOverall Score: 9 out of 10","April 20, 2015","true","278.1"," 44 of 55 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","44","55","4","2"

So with all that said, here we go.\n\nThe singleplayer storyline is extremely fun and I had an absolute blast throwing endless hours into the game's singleplayer shenanigans. I think it was an amazing and refreshing change to have multiple main characters to switch between and instead of the one life you're exploring, you now have three. You've got Michael, the 'former' heister turned FBI informant who faked his death and is living in an upper-class mansion with a dysfunctional family, think Tony Soprano. There's Trevor, the redneck drug-peddling trailer-inhabiting junkie, oh and he's also a cannibal. Then you've got Franklin, the more level-headed ex-gang banger who serves as the younger one of the group. His only real goal is to get out of the hood and make it big.\n\nThe game's story/missions and its overall gameplay is 10/10 for the genre with little room for improvement without changing everything we know GTA to be. That said, we'll move on to the dreaded topic of the game's multiplayer, which is the sole reason why I cannot recommend this game.\n\nMultiplayer is a complete and total joke and Rockstar has truly, TRULY dropped the ball on it. The online play was by far the biggest selling point of the game and it was one that they had advertised and 'focused' on extensively. The group heists are a lot of fun, as are the side missions and the ability to hang out and do whatever with your friends. My biggest complaint is the lack of meaningful content. They haven't added a single new heist since release, nor have they advertised or spoken about any future ones. They also still have yet to add the feature for players to make their own heists or game modes, which is the total key to making this game self-sufficient and community managed, if they were to do that then Rockstar could simply sit back and reap the rewards.\n\nThe severe lack of content aside, anyone who has played this game has one single complaint in mind: HACKERS. EVERY single online lobby (with the exception of private made games) are absolutely filled to the brim with hackers and modders. While many are 'nice' their 'niceness' ruins online gameplay. Why do heists and missions when a modder can simply drop you millions of dollars? There's also the fact that not all of the modders you absolutely will find in online gameplay are 'nice'. Many will abuse their abiities such as godmode or the ability to blow up every player in the entire server at once - using your name. Rockstar hasn't done a SINGLE thing to rectify this situation and not only that, they haven't even so much as made a public statement about it or their plans.\n\nInstead of focusing on the very severe issues plaguing the game's online mode, Rockstar has chosen to release completely meaningless updates that contain nothing but a handful of new cars and horribly meshed/textured clothing items. Not to mention their absolutely god-awful customer support / community management & outreach. There are also a number of bugs that I myself have not run into, such as people being unable to connect to online or join lobbies.\n\nDon't even get me started on the apalling marketing practices shown by Rockstar during the 'sales'. I dare say that Rockstar has far surpassed EA in regards to greed and shady business practices.\n\nSIMPLY PUT - MY FINAL THOUGHTS:\nThis game is a ♥♥♥♥ load of fun, the storyline and singleplayer gameplay is amazing. The online is the worst I've seen and Rockstar has shown incredible ability to completely ignore its playerbase and the problems plaguing it. This game is only good for private lobbies with friends and singleplayer playthroughs.\n\nI hope this review helped you!","December 6, 2015","false","465.3"," 60 of 82 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","60","82","4","8"

Character development is shallow at best with arcs as defined as Mr. Magoo’s sight.  Understand that any story judgement is purely subjective but when I compare it to previous GTA titles, five falls quite short.  The voice acting, sound effects, and textures are all amazing.  These three areas in particular are what I see as the only saving graces of the game and their respective departments should be proud.  The multiplayer is a disheveled exploitive mess with net-code reminiscent of Battlefield 4 at launch and Rockstar’s constant knee-capping of any method of progression.  One main issues plaguing online is faux longevity caused by constant reduction (Rockstar’s “Patches”) in amount of RP (experience) you can gain, making it take longer to obtain level locked items.  The other primary and worst offender in any game is freemium inflation caused by devaluing the in-game currency thus leading to high-cost items and low currency gains from missions.  The devalued currency is solely there to encourage people to buy Rockstar’s “Shark Cards” and is tactic synonymous with poor game quality and no respect for the consumer.\n\nConclusion: Overall I would value Grand Theft Auto V at $20, if you pay more than this you will feel swindled. I understand companies are primarily about the bottom line but as it stand this was a deplorable misstep to cash in and leaves me feeling robbed.  Unless changes are made in future updates, this marks the last Rockstar game I will buy.  I no longer have any confidence in the company's ability to deliver a solid game unbridled by greed.","June 11, 2015","false","383.7"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","34","39","0","0"

Grand Theft Auto has always been amongst the greatest free-roam shooters of all time, and it continues that legacy here with GTA V. The online experience and racing have been greatly improved and the story features three playable protagonists rather than the traditional one.\n\nIn the story of Grand Theft Auto V, you play as three very different characters, with three different, distinctive personalities. First is Michael, a retiree from the illegitimate business of bank robbing and a family man with tons of family problems. Next is the young blood, Franklin. Straight outta the hood and looking to make a living without having to look over his shoulder every step of the way. Lastly is Trevor, the truly psychotic man with no regards for human life. Everyone that plays GTA V instinctively chooses a favorite character, whether it is Michael, because you want to see him get his family back on track, Franklin, because you want to see him create a future for himself, or Trevor, because you too enjoy killing drunken rednecks. Regardless you must play as all three, and the greatest feature that separates the campaign of Grand Theft Auto V from all others is the bank heists. Plan and execute heists, whether you choose stealthy or an all out blood bath, choose your crew which ultimately decides the payout you receive from each heist and enjoy every detail and heist you can. The story is well worth the price of buying the game, but it comes with an added bonus. GTA Online.\n\nAlthough GTA Online had a rocky start with several issues, it is for the most part fixed today, and a very fun experience to play with friends. In the beginning their were terrible servers, problems involving created characters being deleted and now the mission payouts being much lower than early release, and replaying them pays out even less. Along with most others, I am still awaiting for heists in multiplayer, which very well may never come, but regardless GTA Online is still fun. You still have the ability to run around and kill others, as well as civilians, but instead of that simplicity, you can now customize your character, his vehicles, and even where he lives. You earn money through online missions and other methods that helps you pay for newer vehicles, apartments, weapons and clothes. You create your own character and literally choose his skills, which you can later improve.\n\nGrand Theft Auto always has great replay value, gamers still play San Andreas and GTA IV, and of course, several thousand still play GTA V. After the story is over, you can always free roam, and when you get tired of wandering aimlessly, the multiplayer is great to play for long periods of time. Gain satisfaction improving your vehicles and purchasing a high end apartment. I only have one little note about this game, NOT FOR KIDS. Seriously, if you are even the least bit immature, or offended by violence, language or sexual content, please do not buy this game, and don't buy it for kids either. A great game but it's worth waiting for, especially if it will traumatize you, or turn you from innocent, into a kid that spews foul language.\n\n\n\nOverall a masterpiece.

Now, to my review:\n\nSeriously, I had a lot of hype and hope for GTA V ... but I just lost my motivations as fast as a bullet shot.  I admit, this game has a lot of cool and fun stuffs in the single-player ... and with mods, the single-player can continue and replayed for a fair amount of time.  However, GTA Online ... the online part of GTA V, it is just a let-off.  GTA Online is either "Grief" TA Online or "Grind" TA Online.\n\nGTA Online hardly can be said fun at all.  I can be in a lobby filled with players but, not a single one bothered to join my mission ... they are busy shooting each other in freemode.  Then joined a few crews in hope for a better chance, oddly ... the crew-members never accept the invitations.  Of course, one would then troll "git gud and git some friends" ... let's just say, "perhaps bad timing".\n\nIn the end, I am still solo in the freemode ... cannot find anyone to join "my mission" when I see lots of "anyone" running in front of me shooting each other ... -facepalm.  Then one can also troll "go join other player's mission" ... yeah I do but, how'bout a change for a little?  Doing the same heists over-n-over with different players on different days ... just the same dayyum heists, I am getting bored and annoyed.\n\nThe only side-activities offered in GTA Online are ...\n... watching players killing each other in freemode.\n... waste the money on "digital" strippers and hookers.\n... wait for Simeon ordering a dayyum vehicle and try get it.\n... wait for a target vehicle to spawn and try destroy it.\n\nTL;DR - Awesome Single-Player ...

However, not all is well and good. I have found my game absoloutly riddled with bugs, framerate issus, login errors, the game not even being recognizeed as downloaded not too recently. I own a fairly high end GPU, and a moderatly strong CPU, and I still experience drops from 50-60 fps, all the way down to 1-5, on a constant basis.\nE-mailing rockstar support with this issue only ended up with them apologising for my problems, not offering any support or fixes. At the time of writing, I'm really unhappy with the game. I've spent hours searching through youtube videos, online forums, asking friends advice, but not no avail. My current issue is that Rockstar's Social Club 'failed to update,' even after me re-installing the program.\n\nI know I'm just a tiny minority of the huge amount of people playing the game with significant problems like mine, but somethiing really needs to be done. You  probably won't experience the same issues, I know many people in my friends list don't, but for me the game is pretty much unplayable.","June 13, 2015","false","50.7"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","35","41","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerspinach/recommended/271590/","killerspinach","OfficialCleveland","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerspinach/","333 products in account","I'm going to break this review into two parts as GTA5 is truly two games, the single player portion and the multiplayer portion. They both share the same amazing world and most of the same mechanics but are still independant of each other and it is very possible that a player could purchase this game, spend countless hours playing it, and have only played one side of it so I figured people may want  a review of the game that addressed each portion individually. If you want to read about the world itself ie graphics sound etc that is in my single player portion as is the technical portion.\n\nTL:DR - buy it, play it. it's a milestone in world design and sets the bar for all open world games in thE forseeable future. Unless you don't like mature themes you should really ought to play GTA5 at some point.\n\nSingle Players Review\n\nGTA 5 is the best open world based in modern times ever. This is not an opinion, it's a fact. Los Santos is amazing. The characters are hilarious. The music, while not really what I listen to by choice, really fits the environment well and goes a long way in setting that "Cali" feeling the game has. You can wander the streets in this town for  months and still see and hear things you never have before, it really is that big.\n\nThe story is your typical Heat/Scorcese knock-off with a satiric tone. It's the same Rstar brand of intentionally offensive humor and recycled but well put together plot that we have come to expect over the years. The trio of characters each brings their own personality to the story and is an interesting spin on an otherwise tried and true formula for GTA games. There are also multiple endings depending on how you play the game which is a nice touch but the game isn't really choice dependant other than that one instance so don't expect anyhting as fleshed out as Mass Effect or the Witcher series in that department.\n\nThe gameplay itself suffices but could be better. Driving has a more natural feel than in GTA 4 which is good but shooting, in my opinion, could be greatly improved. After Max Payne 3 with it's fluid animations, 3rd person proning, and realistic touches like player weight It's hard to see the combat in GTA 5 as anything else but a major step back for the developer. I understand GTA is a different series than Max Payne and I don't expect them to add things like dive dodge but we're talking about a game that doesn't even let you crouch following on the heels of a game that lets you go into a prone position in 3rd person while maintaining 360 degrees of movement. You can't change the shoulder the camera is over in GTAV either which you could do even in 4 and is a little touch that is greatly missed when you are running and gunning.\n\nMission structure is more of the same. If you've played GTA 4 or Red Dead Redemption you know what to expect here. There is a core of story missions and a world full of side missions, activities and hidden items to pursure (many of which have their own in game rewards for completeing them). It may not be revolutionary but it works and is just as fun as it always has been. If you're an obsessive or achievement hunter you can probably get a few hundred hours of play out of the single player alone. I myself have so far played it once while doing a good amount of the side stuff but not all (Maybe 60%) and got about 120 hours out of the campaign side of the game.\n\nUnlocks and progresssion is what really fuels this beast. There are more buyable vehicles, weapons and upgrades in this game than ever in an Rstar game before. Much of which is quite expensive and takes considerable grinding/hustling of the game's stock market to achieve.  You can buy businesses too some of which open even more missions which in turn unlock other items or abilites for your characters.  Once again, IF you're an obsessive and you fall in love with this game, it can keep you busy for a Skyrim-like amount of time. However if you're not the type that needs to 100% everything you'll probably find yourself leaving the single player sometime shortly after the end of the story.\n\nAs far as optimization the game runs "ok".  I encounter a lot of stuttering and I'm no tech genius but I'll just say that it's one of those games that uses more resources than it should judging from it's graphcs which aren't bad but aren't exactly groundbreaking either.\n\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\nThe multiplayer in my opnion is a complete failure. All of the mechanics and the world are the same and at first it's fun to take to the streets with your buds but that fades fast as you are: harrassed by hackers on servers with no anticheat  other than a report player system, forced to grind your a** off in order to buy practically anything worthwhile, have things you paid for "disappeared" from your garages/wardrobes/inventories, have to sit in lobbies near endlessly to play competitive modes, when you do finally get into a PvP match it's going to be player-built anyway which means you'll be standing in a fenced in parking lot you cannot breach while one guy who knows where the only gun is runs to it and immediatly starts mowing everyone down. And those are just a couple of the more eggregious issues.\n\nIf you have some friends you can always play private but if they're like 99.9% of the players out there they will just want to run the same hesits and a handfull of co-op missions endlessly in order to rank faster and buy some stupid car they can't take on a public server to show off anyway because a hacker is going to roll a ferris wheel over it in about two minutes after server connect. Luckily Rstar's network is made out of tin cans and administrated by a mentally deficient goat so it goes down like all the time which will spare you from having to play the game much.\n\nOf course you can take part in Rstar's toxic "crews" community as well where you will meet a bunch of teenage-to-adult aged people acting like babies and pretending the game is a soap opera.\n\nAnd yes, it's really that bad.\nIf you just touch the multi every once in awhile casually you can get away with not noticing and it's pretty fun. If you want to "get into the game" and have it be "your game" (the one you play all the time) then I got bad news for you because all that awaits you is frustration driven but the thought of how great this experience could have been and how much of a trainwreck it actually is.\n\nCONCLUSION\nAll in all I strongly recommend GTA 5 even with it's catastrophe of a multiplayer. The story is fun. the world is awesome. the characters are hilarious and the single player alone is WELL worth the 60$ prIce tag. Compared to what other devs try to get away with giving us at the same price point I'd say GTA 5 is a heck of a deal.","October 27, 2015","true","577.0"," 90 of 133 people (68%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","68","90","133","10","2"

The singleplayer is great like any GTA game, and the multiplayer is a lot of fun if you have friends to play it with. However, because of Rockstar's EXTREMELY shady and dirty business practices regarding the summer sale, I cannot in good faith give a positive review.\n\nFirst off, when the 2015 Summer Sale started, the base game, priced as $60 USD, was removed from the Steam store (but restored later), and some "bundles" of GTA V + other things were added. One was GTA V + Max Payne 3 + 200,000 GTA Online cash, another was GTA V + GTA: SA + 200,000 GTA Online cash, and the third was GTA V + 1,000,000 GTA Online cash. All of these bundles are "priced" at $80 USD but with a 25% off sticker slapped on, leaving the game at $60 (meanwhile, after being restored, you could buy just GTA V for $60...)\n\nA few days into the summer sale, I see GTA V under the "Top Sellers" listings, priced at $20 (33% off of $30). I mouse over the listing, and it definitely says it is GTA V. I then go to the store page, and lo and behold Rockstar placed a "bundle" of GTA ONLINE IN GAME CASH CARDS AT THE TOP OF THE STORE PAGE, CAUSING STEAM TO DISPLAY THE PRICE OF THE GAME TO BE $20, A COMPLETE ♥♥♥♥ING FLAT OUT LIE.\n\nGo ♥♥♥♥ yourselves Rockstar, I will not support these business practices (especially on a game that is arguable 2 years old at the time of this writing), and I ask everyone willing to listen to not support such business practices either.\n\nEDIT: Additionally, to my knowledge, because of how Steam's refund work, you CANNOT refund a game if you purchased "consumable dlc" such as in game money. So, if you bought one of the bundles of GTA V + Shark Card, you most likely cannot refund the game.","June 15, 2015","false","157.3"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","30","34","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YahooYann/recommended/271590/","YahooYann","YahooYann","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YahooYann/","253 products in account","YES\nThis is one of those games that nail that sweetspot of RP [Roleplaying] and the perfected multiplayer that is in GTA V. Personally in these games I go for that and its typically hard for me to find games that are like this that my friends and I enjoy playing. GTA before [so GTA IV] hit the perfect spot of relying on the community of mods to keep it interesting and multiplayer which was fantastic. I think in these kind of reviews it's important to mention its predecessors and judge them to see exactly how far they have come. GTA IV was fantastic but abit buggy alot of glitches to be exploited and kinda fell short in that RP aspect as I saw it.\n\nPros:\n-Alot more to do in the terms of Role Playing and in terms of multiplayer alot more for the player to strive for which is a key aspect in keeping a player immersed and infactuated with a game alot of the reason why Skyrim and such are still so played\n- The multiplayer is done really well no ports or anything to have a server just for you and your friends to screw around in\n- Roleplaying has that optional feature that it isnt necessary to have rely on like in Skyrim. There is that feeling that you can have it with friends aswell the game is what you make of it and I LOVE IT\n- The asthetics are supremely adjustable more than alot, even most games have out there and helps catch the eye that just give you that itchy finger for screenshots\n- Friends, if you have any this is a game that can just be played for screwing around in a sandbox feel and keep the game anticipating which most games don't do\n- The game literally is just for ♥♥♥♥ and laughs there are some many things in this game that just make fun of other things in media which keep the game hilarious and fun to play\n- The story mode is well done but not alot of replay value and is fun just for a story mode with good characters and voice acting that aren't heard in every single game you play like troy baker as the main voice actor helps make it diverse\n- Online and Singleplayer are easy to switch to and from with easy access to players etc.\n- The ingame recording is a nice and good feature to have that makes the game feel a complete package which helps complete that 60$ feeling to a game such as this\n- PC Master Race> Console Beta Testing\n\nCons:\n- Public servers suck like public restrooms when you enter one you non-stop get killed and robbed, etc. and it seems that no matter what when you leave an activity you automatically enter one unless you set it to make your own private server\n- When you are in a public server when someone talks in it it goes across all the server there should be some limiting proximity to this because it is just plain mic spam when someone is talking.\n- The damage system for cars is kind of short cars give way super fast unless you buy armor for it [in about like 100 levels] which sucks and gives the feeling of buying cars just plain dumb\n- Killing in the game is a bit realistic and a bit stupid a combonation of both which could be easily fixed when you shoot at someone they take about awhole round in anywhere but the head\n- Cop are extremely accurate and actually do stuff which is good in the sense never do something bad or the cops will come eat you, but its done in away that if you do something like run over a headlight they chase you. This drags away from the initial feel of GTA in my opinion\n- The ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ LOADING there are so many loading screens that take awhile to through even with the game optimzation\n- The game is the most demanding game I've played ever which makes it hard to have fun and not worry about your fps the whole time and that sucks major cohoanez (i run a 970 and still get 42 fps and some points)\n- Game invites there are so many of them and that little DING that you get when you are playing sucks ♥♥♥ cause its so damn frequent and sucks, i know there is the setting to pretty much turn it off but you can't from my experience when playing with friends\n\nWith all of these pros they do outweigh the cons in the game in away that yes if you look closely at the game every second you will notice but otherwise if you play the game normally you won't most of the time. This all being said i find the game to still be fun with and without friends hours and hours of gameplay in and will proly delve hundreds upons thousands of hours in the game with friends, mods, and gameplay enjoyment. With so much to do and work toward it keeps the game perfect. This is a perfect game that was worth the wait and everything is lovely and asthetic as a hot girl in the sun.","April 15, 2015","true","267.0"," 156 of 246 people (63%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","63","156","246","20","8"

As if it's back to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, where content is no longer updated - we don't have access to the same content of Online that we do in Story Mode - which depletes the whole purpose of playing Story Mode altogether other than for its immersion.\n\niv) Difficulty & Camera Lock: It would be incredible to be able to enhance the difficulty and enjoyment of the game by having the option to create a challenge for yourself. Being able to lock your camera into first person and set the difficulty to hard would be a great addition for players seeking a challenge.\n\nv) Organization: It could be interesting to implement the Organization system from Online into Story Mode, to create more reason to play it after completion, and a more viable source of income after businesses and heists.\n\n\nOnline:\nI. AI Intelligence: The intelligence of AI is lesser in Online than the intelligence of civilians in Story Mode by far, which creates an unenjoyable experience for the player interaction with, including but not limited to, civilians and police.\n\nII. Outfit Customization: The exploitation of cosmetic appliance is condemned by Rockstar North. Instead of allowing players to customize their outfit to their wishes within the wardrobe, players have to exploit a glitch to customize their outfit to the maximum ability.\n\nIII. Anti-Cheat System: The Anti-Cheat System is by-far the worst. There is no enjoyment in the PVP system when players are forced to surrender (enable passive mode / leave the lobby) or feed the monster. Some renowned hacks are, including but not limited to, teleportation, invincibility, modified ammunitions, aimbot.\n\nIV. Server System, Part 1: The server system is very poor with connectivity. Rather than having secure dedicated servers [both public & private], we have client side servers. Creating connectivity issues and problems with the detection of cheaters. Since a server is "client side" and not "dedicated," it makes it more difficult to record the server logs.\n\nV. Server System, Part 2: Servers should be able to enable or disable an "Anti-Cheat System," to allow both the modder and vanilla community enjoy their game.\n\nVI. Server System, Part 3: Servers should be able to set their own "Targeting Mode" and "Camera Lock," to allow a player to more so customize their experience of the game in Online. Note that some players enjoy locking their camera into first person view, but this brings them to the disadvantage of having to fight other players without the same camera view.\n\nVII. Heist System, Part 1:\n\nWe need more heists. Having only the option to do the following heists:\n(a) The Fleeca Job [$143,750]; (b) The Prison Break [$500,000]; (c) The Humane Labs Raid [$675,000]; (d) The Series A. Funding [$505,000]; (e) and The Pacific Standard Job [$1,250,000].\nThey're becoming repetetive. We should introduce more heists, with slightly better payouts.\n\nIf another 5 heists are to be created, I would suggest:\n\n(a) 2 Players, $150,000-$200,000; (b) 4 Players: $800,000; (c) 4 Players: $800,000; (d) 4 Players: $1,350,000-$1,500,000. (e) 4-6 Players: $1,500,000-$2,000,000. With new content for each heist, including but not limited to, aircrafts, watercrafts, and land vehicles.\n\nVIII. Heist System, Part 2: It would be incredible to have the option to have a more complex heist system. Where we can do our heists just like we do them in Story Mode, including but not limited, "Subtle" or "Loud."\n\nIX. Warfare by Sea: We should have more watercrafts, dedicated to combat. Combat on average is not by sea, but by air and on land. The only official way of combat at sea that we have available to us is "Piracy Prevention."\n\nX. Mod Shops: Create a variety of shops dedicated to vehicular modification & repair for different vehicles, as follows: a) Pegasus; b) Aircraft; c) Watercraft; and d) Offroad. As we already have mod shops dedicated to caring for personal vehicles [regular: Los Santos Customs] and personal vehicles [special: Benny's Original Motorworks] I have very many Pegasus vehicles [by land, air, and sea] that I cannot modify, and they're almost useless in PVP. With the lack of, including but not limited to, armour, camouflage [respray], tires, window tint, suspension, it's becoming difficult to use them. I have heard many complaints from offroaders, although I myself prefer to use suspension for all vehicles, that they wish to further raise the vehicle rather than further lower or keep it at stock. They should be given this option!\n\n\nOverall, I enjoy the game very much. Unfortunately though, there are still many things within its structure that needs further development. With the profit of micro-transactions that Rockstar North makes from "Shark Cards" alone, the money should be used to improve these things.\n\n\nStory Mode Rating: 8/10.\nOnline Rating: 7.5/10.","February 5","true","871.6"," 35 of 43 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","35","43","3","7"

Issues with the multiplayer, (which I couldn't solve but I could be wrong) and didn't see the option etc are like this;\n\n\n- Cant choose a server location(Nor shows you what your ping is). I mean what year is this Rockstar?\n- On top of possible bad connection, you cant choose the amount of players you want to play with either, it might put you in a full pop server or a server with 1 person in it. So fire up the 'find a new session' button until you can find your liking !\n- Because of the possible bad connection, there are server disconnects(which puts you back into the single player )\n- There are armored cars with bulletproof windows running around killing people, and if god forbid you want to defend yourself(only way how is blowing them up) YOU pay for their cars repair. Around 6k every time.\n- There are invisible cheaters with rocket machine guns.\n- Doings heists without 4 friends is a pain in the ♥♥♥\n- You can only choose what kind of session you wanna join through single player, such as private lobby. Theres only the option to find a new session on multiplayer which puts you in a random public server without asking you what kind of session  you want. At the time of writing this I couldnt find it.\n\nOn top of all this, there is a stuttering issue with hunderds of people are having and Rockstar support doesnt know how to respond with other than copy paste answers. (Link :  https://support.rockstargames.com/hc/communities/public/questions/203473047-GTA-V-PC-Stutter-Issue)\n\nAll in all, multiplayer and single player feel like 2 different games entirely.

It's a good, visually stunning, well optimised GTA game with a decent story and plenty to do.\nI still find GTA VC is better for setting, soundtrack, story and GTA SA the most fun gameplay wise but that could just be nostalgia.\nLooks like the Singleplayer Expansion/DLC is never coming. Large areas like the casino, race track, prison etc are all well modeled but they remain unused and inaccessable.\n\nBuying for Multiplayer?\nGive it a miss.\n\nAs many have already said it's a total ♥♥♥♥ show online.\nLoad times are absurdly long and frequent, UI is crap, theres no server browser and no modded server support.\nThe key element of the game (it's the title for christ sake) is stealing cars, but guess what: You cant keep them in online, they must be purchased. Items worth having online require ridiculous amounts of grinding due to low rewards for missions and any new cars, boats, planes are added at extremely high prices to sell Shark Cards. There isnt enough to do, or enough fun to be had to justify the time required to buy said items without microtransactions.\n\nThe games anti-cheat system is pretty much non-existant. Cheaters/Hackers run rampant killing players and/or spewing cash.  Seems kind of baron of things to do online with friends once you've completed the Heists.\n\nI really don't care about MP in a GTA game, a token mode allowing friends to jump in and do co-op in single player would have been much better (You already have 3 protagonists doing missions together!).\nI sincerely hope MP's influence is minimal on the development of future titles (Bully 2, GTA VI, RDR 3) but unfortunately that's highly unlikely.","April 11","false","137.0"," 33 of 41 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","33","41","3","2"

Im leaving this review to address its ONLINE gameplay.\n\nWhen not being subject to a modder's or "hacker's" myriad of exploits, Online gameplay can start off as fun.  You'll learn quickly, however, that the many necessary team-oriented missions that are part of the online story can become a ridiculously repetitive nuisance.  This is mostly because the missions can be challenging and the people you play with can be mentally challenged and unfortunately, if any member of the team fails any part of the mission, you'll be restarting the mission; or if any member leaves, you'll be restarting the team building altogether and then of course the mission in its entirety.  Doesn't sound bad?  Factor in the load times between every fail, restart or regroup and you'll think twice.\n\nTo avoid having a bad gaming experience because of other people, you may try to vet the heist members in your lobby which has proven to take a minimum of 30 minutes per heist.  Another option is to setup an all-star team of just your friends, but you may very likely run into a plethora of technical obstacles that will completely prevent you from playing altogether: be it Session Time outs when you try to start a session, member disconnection for whatever ridiculous bug that rockstar can't iron out or the painfully long load times between freeworld and heist sessions we all must endure when beginning, concluding or, all too commonly, repeating any mission or heist.  Simply put, the online facet of GTA seems to be forced and needs a LOT more work from its seemingly non-existent support to make the end user happy. As it stands, GTA online is a huge waste of my entertainment time.","November 6, 2015","false","169.2"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","29","35","2","0"

I've enjoyed the single player side of this game and can't really criticise on any point. There was one rather gory scene with Trevor and an interrogation, but that doesn't really bother me though has been a topic of discussion on the internet it seems. All in all, though I don't play the single player side much anymore, it was great to play.\n\nNow, the bad side...\nUltimately I bought GTA V for playing online, who wouldn't? Well, in the early days of the PC release I was thrilled, loved every minute of it, but some months later that's changed somewhat. I appreciate the DLC's being free, that's nice for sure. Unfortunately there are four points which make online a big let down at the moment.\n\n1) Server reliability problems: Sometimes I end up in empty sessions, or the session suddenly becomes empty. Sometimes I get timeout messages, sometimes I can't save, sometimes I can't even go online or host a mission due to some temporary problem with the cloud servers.\n2) Cheating: This has become quite a nuisance, I usually encounter at least one cheater a day and usually within the first 10 minutes of being online in a populated session. I've never encountered a game so populated with cheaters.\n3) Limits on what you can do compared to single player: Hunting, for example, isn't possible online. I won't go heavily into this as those who play the game will know what limits there are, suffice to say it disappoints me that some things which exist in single player do not exist in multiplayer even though they could do.\n4) Player base: The only real time I enjoy playing online is usually if I play with friends, not with randomers. At least 1 in every 3 missions I play I usually encounter a troll or someone which otherwise ruins the game for everybody else. A classic example is when someone leaves a setup or heist mission almost 90% of the way through it being completed - so frustrating!\n\nIf some of the above problems were improved at a later date then I would probably recommend the game. At this time I can't say I can recommend it unless you mainly want to play single player's storyline.","August 9, 2015","false","771.7"," 51 of 73 people (70%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","70","51","73","7","5"

The game itself is great, I love the new features, graphics, characters, etc. However, there are so many bugs and problems it makes playing impossible. The first most annoying problem is the crashing. At startup, the game crashes after looping the intro sound for about 5 minutes. Only after that can you play by pressing the retry button. Second, the game is very, very, very laggy. After playing about 10 minutes of smooth as silk gameplay, the game fluctuates from high fps to 0, in many stutters. It is not my pc or anything because the game is very smooth with inconsistent, frequent stutters, not a rough constant fps. This makes playing unbearable, even low fps would be preferred. Lastly, a few minor bugs are that in the voice settings menu, if you go down to it, the game automatically freezes and crashes.\n\nUPDATE:\nFor some reason, I played today and got dream results. No crashing for the first time ever when opening, and it did not stutter once, even after leaving the game for some time.

When Gotten Gains started it started causing many, if not everyone performance issues.\nAlso, Rockstar was originally banning people for using singleplayer mods which was a ♥♥♥♥ move by Rockstar.\nIn fact I believe most negative reviews on this game is because people have been banned for using singleplayer mods such as the FOV mod.\n\nGrand Theft Auto V itself is easily a 8, 9, or even 10/10 game in most reviews.\nThe AI is amazing, esspecially the cops in this game.\nThe visuals of this game are incredible.\nIt has a good story and unlike past Grand Theft Autos, three main characters, each with there own unique personality.\nThe voice acting is great, it has a good story and it's so fun to  playthrough it.\n\nHowever that's the game itself, multiplayer lobbies as I said are trash, with hackers and poor optimization.\nMost of the games community is very aggresive and modders/hackers everywhere.\nThe fun in missions, heists, races, etc can easily be spoiled in some way.\nSuch as doing a heist, and somebody decides to leave. It's over, the heist will end and you'll have to find someone else.\n\nThis game is very difficult for me to review because this is one of my favorite games.\nIt's just due to Rockstar and some of the community to make the experience annoying.\n\nI feel that because after everyone beats Grand Theft Auto V and goes to GTA Online though i'd have to give it a negative review. Considering that is what everyone is going to be doing aside from singleplayer modding or whatever they'll be doing. So, negative review from me.\n","August 22, 2015","false","402.4"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","3"

They bundled GTA V with other things (older GTA games, in-game items, etc), raised the price to 80, advertised 25-33% off, and sold it for 60. Basically, the raised the price just to slash it down to the regular price and promote a "sale".\n\nThis game truly is wonderful and spectacular in every category.

In less than 3 days I finished the main missions and most of the optional side missions (game completion at 75%), without stealing more than 3 cars/vehicles in total (in the stats I have Trevor with one police car stolen and Michael with one FireTruck and a Taxi stolen, Franklin didn't steal no nothing). I also played on the side Online in that game time and reached a Rank over 20, it's great fun with or without friends.\n\nIt feels like this game is a drug that stole my life...but I don't regret a thing.\n\nThings I really enjoyed and you should probably do too:\nThe game, despite it's large size, it's amazingly optimized with many graphic options to tweak. I have exactly the minimum requirements and I can run it, sure I had to turn every fancy pc enchanting option off and it looks like the graphics on the old-gen consoles, but I am happy, it works with +30fps.\n\nThe missions are really captivating, the money spending system feels more challenging (because you have a lot to spend it on, to invest it, to simly lose it). You get to meet many interesting sidecharacters and the overall voiceacting is really good. Besides the actual story and the many twists in the missions, they have quite a replay value due to their minichallenges for each of them (like 'finish in the required time', 'complete it in a certain order' etc.) if you are a completionist.\n\nThe car handleing, amazing, the gave up the GTA IV 'simulator' like driving and brought back the arcade like car handling from the older ones, where you can rotate in the air or do some nice stunts.\n\nThe world is really immersing, each NPC with it's small story, with their interactions etc. It's a living world filled with living people, animals and moments...and with Internet, Radio and Cable TV!\n\nI can't quite say there is a lot of choice based tasks, but there is a really decent number of those, most of them involving planning or the interaction choice, but as long as you have imagination there will always be a choice.\n\nIt's great that we have animals, you can kill them, you can play/interact with them, you can even become them at a certain point (hidden easter egg). Most of the people are avereage aged, from 20-60 or so, I kinda wished we also had the extrems like children or quite old people...sure it would probablly create some controversy, but it would make give the game an even more real feeling.\n\nAnd I could enumerate so many more...but now I have to get back to the game.","April 18, 2015","true","610.4"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","34","48","5","1"

And it's a shame, because GTA V is a fantastic game once you look past the loading times, broken lobby system, unbalanced PvP and Social Club DRM.\n\nFirst, they try to force people onto their own DRM platform by restricting retail copies from being activated on Steam; all to save the standard 30% cut to Valve.\n\nBut that's nothing compared to intentionally misleading customers by jacking the price and applying a 25% 'discount', which brings the price a massive £1 lower than the previous asking price. It's nothing more than a deliberate attempt to mislead people into thinking they're getting a discount, when they are not.\n\nUnfortunately, most consumper protection law does not apply to Steam thanks to that handy 'subscriber agreement'. Regardless, it''s worth noting that in Scotland, where Rockstar are based, this is completely illegal.","June 13, 2015","false","281.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","1"

But there are just way too many problems for it to be so. Sure, the mechanics behind the game are solid. It feels amazing. The physics are solid, the visuals are stunning, and it plays really smoothly. That is, until it doesn't. Which it won't for long.\n\nRiddled with frame stutters, stupid menu mechanics, and an economy so broken at least half of the community modded in money. The economy is such a grind, and you are punished for having fun (ammo costs, vehicle destruction costs), that it just sucks the fun out of the game.\n\nOh god and don't get me started on the "hackers". Rockstar knew from day one that mods and modders were an inevitability. And they had a system from GTA 4 that was perfect. Modded games played with other modded games, and vanilla games played with vanilla games. Simple and easy. Hell, it would have been easy to implement that no progress was saved on a modded online client. But they didn't. So if you go online 5/10 times you'll get a lobby where ♥♥♥♥ just blows up because one guy has a "trainer" and kills everything with a single button. You may get a lobby where there are no modders and it's good, that is until suddenly the game puts you in a lobby by yourself at random, or a modder joins.\nIt's been over 2 months since I last played due to this problem, and yet STILL its as bad as it was before.\n\nSo to summarise. Wait before you buy this game. Just honestly everything I have written here is just the beginning. I sincerely hope this game improves with time and Rockstar actually learn (or even do something other than money grab).\n\n","October 20, 2015","false","480.2"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","19","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doggts/recommended/271590/","Doggts","Doggts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Doggts/","595 products in account","This game suffers from a wide range of issues, bad design decisions, as well as a large amount of hackers. Singleplayer itself is rather alright, though it's a bit lacking in activities.\n\nI'll focus on some things hurting Online:\n- Terrible, aggressive community.\n- Connection issues, disconnecting, game moving you to a different server and away from your friends you just played with.\n- Very limited clothes. Rockstar has no trouble having a hundred different shirts, including some really ugly urine gold colored one, but they can't add models available in Singleplayer. So the amount of clothing models are very limited, some of them are also missing few colors - you can get a business shirt (without a suit) in red colour, but you can't get it along with a suit. Also, you can wear a scarf with a pink tanktop, but you can't wear it with a white tanktop. They're the same models, just different colours.\n- You better have good internet, because you won't stand a chance in gun fights with higher ping.\n- Car customization is pathethic in the game. A lot of the cars are barely customizable, the best thing you can do in many of them is lengthen the sides by a couple of centimeters. Some cars aren't customizable at all and you can't even put them in your normal garage.\n- Rockstar added a fast, bulletproof vehicle along with the Heists Update. Bulletproof vehicle. In a community which enjoys killing absolutely everyone for no reason. It's not really that expensive either.\n- Heists are pretty damn boring. They're nothing like in Singleplayer, where you have multiple approaches, places to set up your escape vehicles, et cetera, et cetera. In GTA Online, heists are pretty much standard missions with some story behind them, you don't have a choice in how to go through with the mission.\n- If somebody leaves during a heist, everyone will drop out. Combine that with the connection issues and you'll get the possible disaster.\n- You need to grind a lot for money.. or find a hacker who will simply spawn millions for you to pick up. They're rather common, so you won't have trouble finding one, though it will either be the friendly, money giving type or a murderer with god mode on.\n- GTA V is still updated! That should be a pro, if not for the fact that those updates consist of maybe five vehicles, some clothes (mostly reskins), a weapon if lucky. That's it.\n- GTA V uses a level (rank) system for its weapons, so you'll be able to unlock this rifle only at level 33 or something. ...Except that they added free, widely available DLCs which add the best weapons stat-wise to purchase with no rank restrictions. (?)\n\nThere's also the fact that Rockstar fooled customers by raising the price of GTA V when Steam Summer Sale 2015 started (so the discount it got was equivalent to its standard price of 59,99€). Not only that, they included Shark Cash Card. Said Shark Cash Card gives you in-game money. Sounds pretty sweet, right? Except that it counts as a redeemed DLC the moment you get it, which means that you won't be able to get a refund for GTA V because of it.\n\nAll in all, singleplayer, which I didn't focus a lot on as it's rather okay, has a nice story, likeable characters, although it's lacking in activities. Online is terrible and Rockstar's greedy attempts at taking more money aren't helping the game as a whole. If you're not sure whether to get it or not, ask yourself if you have friends to play with, because trying to find yourself in the community will be problematic. Don't get it just for the Singleplayer.","October 9, 2015","false","200.7"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","70","33","47","5","23"

That game blew me away when I first played it. I honestly thought the freedom it offered you was an illusion and that the game would spontaniously end. But it never did, and I kept playing it over and over again.\n\nNowadays sandbox games are a dime a dozen, but Rockstar has remained top dog in the fight since the PS2. Why? Unlike Volition who make excuses as to why they couldn't provide features everyone liked, Rockstar takes risks and gives you things you never thought you wanted.\n\nGTA5 takes place in Los Santos, which was previously featured in GTA San Andreas. Los Santos by far is the most detailed single location in the entire series. The game features things like industrial ghettos, vast mountains with wilderness, and expansive oceans you can swim through and uncover secrets while dodging sharks. It lets you seamlessly switch between three protagonists who are not only just as detailed as any of the previous ones, but are also completely distinguishable from each one with individual sidequests and unique gameplay modes.\n\nGTA5 looks great, plays great, feels distinctive and most importantly took risks that paid off immensly. In a world of botched launches, underwhelming overhyped titles and a desire for a game the developers actually cared about making. GTA5 goes above and beyond the call of duty. It is hard to describe any one flaw with this game without comparing the 2000 things it does well. What other modern game can you say the same?\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=432237450","April 25, 2015","true","120.7"," 37 of 55 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","37","55","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/INeedFerrets/recommended/271590/","INeedFerrets","Ferrets","http://steamcommunity.com/id/INeedFerrets/","308 products in account","tl;dr - SP really good, MP lacking and ranking/money is stupid, modding should be supported, bad Rockstar for trigger happy banning\n\nI enjoy the game and think it is pretty fun, but it has a lot of issues. Whilst I would have given it a thumbs up, Rockstars new trigger happy stance with banning has made me think otherwise. Okay, first the game issues.\n\nThe single player (SP) is fantastic really. It's deep, vast and between the three consoles I've played it on, I still haven't seen all there is to offer. There is a lot of thought and detail put into the single player and it makes it so much better for it.\n\nMultiplayer (MP) feels very two dimensional in comparison. Whilst it makes sense for some things not to happen in MP, I think there could have been a lot added (depending on server stress). I find it odd that they don't include animals in MP. Arguments could be it's wasted resources that could go into displaying pedestrians and enemies etc. But a lack of a lot of these features makes MP feel boring if you're on your own.\n\nThe leveling and financial system in the game feels very much like Rockstar making you play as long as possible through grinding. If we're speaking about getting to level 100, the mission variety is lacking, the payout is terrible and the people you play with don't make it any better. It may not be a majority but I guess it'd be nice to be able to talk to someone in a lobby who hasn't claimed to have had past relations with either my mother or sister.\n\nMicrotransactions? Really? Makes sense that the actual good vehicles are an EXTORTIONATE amount and the mission payoffs are pitiful. You want a fighter jet? Like the one shown in the MP trailer? Well, that will be about 40-60hrs of multiplayer gaming just to get to a level high enough to even think about purchasing it. If you haven’t been saving money (which you won’t have been since ammunition is also a lot) then you will have to do another 10hrs or so to have enough to buy it (being very optimistic) or pay £11.99 for $3 million. Between university and a part time job, I don’t have time for that sh- stuff. I said stuff. “Maybe you should have a little more dedication or patience!” Well I’m sorry but as much as video gaming would be a great career, I’m not there... yet.\n\nNow, the modding thing is what made me rate down. Modding was inevitable for the PC. Absolutely inevitable. You only have to look up some GTA IV gameplay on YouTube to see people modding the hell out of it. Even on MP. Now, there is a huge difference between GTA IV and V MP which is why there will be stricter policy on modding. The ranking progression in GTA IV had little to no relevance and there were no microtransactions. The only things (I remember at least) you unlocked through ranking was items of clothing. In GTA V, ranking unlocks guns, vehicles and clothes. The former two being of most importance. Now microtransactions are involved then modding is a lot more dangerous to Rockstar since people may be modding money in which is a loss for them and it’s a shame Rockstar resort to this.\n\n“BUT FERRETS!” I hear you cry, “Rockstar has been banning people who have modded SP only or allowing to make graphical changes like FOV. What about that?”\n\nYes. This is stupid. I guess I can’t know how Rockstar have developed the information they receive from players. Is it as complex as knowing exactly what files they have changed and what to? I don’t know. For all we know it could just be as soon as the game files have been opened a big red “BAN” button starts flashing and someone on the other side presses it.\n\nBut it’s all stupid. All of it. Ha! You thought I was defending Rockstar? No way. The trigger happiness of Rockstar is akin to EA’s usage of microtransactions (by the way, I pay £50-£60 for a game, I expect the full god damn game). I’m sorry to anyone who works at Rockstar, don’t take it personally (I am sure you are all sweet and lovely people), but the ban hammer attitude is a braindead move. Rockstar, you’re sticking a middle finger up your customers poop void by banning them for modding and losing any trust they had in you as developers. This may not impact GTA sales in a huge way, but there will be more games. If someone is banned for a FOV mod for SP only, like a scorned lover, would they buy your next game?  I think a reset would be a little less harsh but they shouldn’t have to happen in the first place. Rockstar is desperately trying to force people to use the broken leveling and money system they have made. Some people mod things that don’t have ANY effect on those system but they’re banned them anyway.\n\nRight, summary of an essay now. The reason mods are being banned (from what I can gather) is Rockstar are afraid of people damaging their MP system of leveling and microtransactions. The solution, in my opinion, is an evaluation of what makes GTA so much fun and why the current system is broken. You know what? We don’t need an evaluation. I can tell you right now. What makes GTA so much fun? A lot of messing about. Why is the current system broken? You have to level up and pay to have access to anything to mess about and the funnest things to mess about with are beyond a lot of peoples reach. That’s why we’re modding, because Rockstar doesn’t want us to have fun (paraphrasing but I wanted something dramatic for my closing sentence).","May 4, 2015","false","114.9"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","19","24","0","0"

(Both single and online) But there are just some so dumb things in the game, that makes me so sad. It could've been a SO MUCH better experience with more caring about the little things. (Nice delays, tho.)\n\n\nCons:\n;online;\n-p2p servers. In itself it wouldn't be a problem, but for some reason me and my buddies ALWAYS get thrown in a horribly lagging session with a guy being host with horrible connection.\n-The cop system is extremly dumb, just randomly appear in the nowhere (I was in front of a mountain, then I saw a cop just spawn there and continue to chase me. Aight.)\n-A one-star chase can be longer then a five-star one. That's pretty legit.\n-YOU GET BANNED FOR USING MODS. Any mods. Basically, FOV adjuster. Because you can set your fov to 70-75 at MAX. That's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (You get banned if you use mods single OR online. So there goes that.)\n-Because of p2p servers, most of the times you can empty a magazine into a person, and take a whole zero damage. And then all you can see is he hits you once, and you're dead.\n-Basically until the mod-ban thing, there were no anti-cheat system. (Because of p2p servers.)\n-Sometimes mechanic doesn't seem to care about you, shatting on your head even if he had his payment.\n\n;singleplayer;\n-I feel like the graphics options on itself is useless, just like in Watch Dogs. I get the same FPS on 800x600 lowest settings, then on 1920x1080 everything high. How is that possible even?\n-The vehicles you buy, you have to take care of them. Otherwise, you just lose them. (AFAIK, there's no option like online to get it back... Sadly.)\n-Sometimes random events (one npc stole money from another, etc.) are just straight up not working. You return the stuff, the npc that got robbed just despawns. (Though, it's rare.)\n\nCons that are common in both single, and online:\nYou can't aim straight up. That is really dumb.\nThe FPS mode because of the low FOV can easily cause motion sickness. (First game that caused me motion sickness in 10 years that I played..)\n\nOn the other hand..\npros:\n;online;\n-Fun online, if you're getting paired with a good host.\n-Different races (land, bike, sea, plane).\n-THEFT PROTECTION, AND INSURANCE. This is what the singplayer is missing. If your vehicle gets destroyed, you can just call MMI, and they'll provide you with the same car. (Usually other players blow up your car, in that case if it has both  (protection and insurance) they'll pay some money (1% of the car's price?) and you can call MMI to get it back free.\n-Mechanic brings you a selected car from your garage if you give him a call (and decides to not be lazy.)\n-Pretty neat character creation. You can create unique characters with it.\n-Payout is quite good for the effort-reward system.\n-Heists are fun, with pretty good payout depending on difficulty. (And on host, how he sets the payout on the last "day" of the heist.)\n-In heists, it gives you the feel that everyone is equally needed (if you have no team lives left, and someone dies, the three can't clutch it, because the heist will fail.)\n\n;single;\n\n-Loveable characters, hateable kids. (I'm looking at you, Jimmy.)\n-The story mode is pretty fun, it has it's own moments.\n-You can chose out of a three possible ending, two of them affects the endgame.\n-Assasination missions with Franklin let's you play stock market in your favour. (It is quite OP, actually. But hey, it's single so)\n-It could be either con, or pro, depending on which side of you are; The autosave function in missions are quite casual-friendly. (Usually if you do something in a mission, and you happen to die, or fail with the objective, you'll be booted back to that part, or a bit earlier.)\n-After you done the main story, there's still a lot stuff to do (if you haven't done it while playing the story already.) (And have chosen the third option as of the ending mission.)\n\nIf I were to press myself, I could still write a lot to the pro, con side.\nI think they even themselves out, though the FOV and the cop system is a really big downer.\n\nOverall, I'd say I'm recommending the game, and at the same time, not.\nIt's fun, but it has a dark side that can really screw you over if you'd just like to hop in, and play a few contact missions, or heists.\n\nFor TL;DR people: Buy this game at your own risk, don't expect high quality online servers, it's fun if you get lucky with a host. Isn't worth 60 euros in my eyes, though. (As of being already an almost 2 years old game) and it's painfully obvious flaws.\n\nCheers.","May 4, 2015","false","100.3"," 19 of 24 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","19","24","0","0"

I'm not someone who spends money on things ingame and I finished the heists within days with my friends.\n\n...Until Ill Gotten Gains came out.\n\nWhat this did was broke  mod support for me, and make my FPS drop dramatically. I had a stable 40-50 fps before the patch, now I have 20 at all times. My game even froze after a SINGLE car blew up. Basically rendering MP unplayable.\n\nSingleplayer is still good though if you can find a way for the trainers or mods work. But not much replayability after you finish the campaign, only to mess around and stuff. I honestly have no reason to play it anymore after 130 hours of gameplay, about 100 of which in mulitplayer. It's just a shame. For such a hyped game, it delivered what everyone expected, but because it delivered what everyone wanted, there's nothing left to want. Hence, that's why the game is basically finished for me. I did everything I wanted, messed around with what I wanted, did the missions I wanted. It's done. The game is complete. Which is the complete opposite of what TBOGT and GTA IV did for me. I had more fun in that because you could use trainers online with your friends to have an all out mess around experience. Unfortunately that isn't the case with GTA V, and they jewed the crap out of it so... Yeah.\n\nSo.\nSingleplayer: 8/10, great fun but is eventually boring after the story.\n\nMultiplayer: Used to be 9/10, now 6/10, see EDIT 2 for reasoning below.\n\nHeists: 10/10[/b], my only gripe is that they go by so quickly if you have a good crew.\n\nConclusion: 7/10 - It's a great game, and met all expectations. However, there's nothing more to expect. Like, they are just beating a dead horse at this point. And that's really what ruined it for me and for others. Just, nothing more to do. I completed all the heists, bought the fancy cars, did the story missions, messed around. It's done, but yet Rockstar still wants to squeeze more out of this game because they think it's still got potential. Sorry Rockstar, but no. What you need to understand and sorry for being repetitive, is that this game has nothing left. You had everything from day 1 and that's what didn't keep us eagerly waiting for more.\n\nEDIT: Seems they patched the MP FPS being completely screwed in ther Lowriders update, it's back to normal for me. Still, everything else in the review applies.\n\nEDIT 2: Been playing it again recently, anything they add now is just fueling hackers, grinders or shark card users. It's basically impossible to play now considering everyone has a Hyrda (which they use to troll on a regular basis), destroying personal vehicles with no ♥♥♥♥s given. Hackers are still rampant (In fact, I used to know a guy who hacked for a year until he got bored of GTA V, completely undetected) and free roam isn't that fun anymore. That being said, some updates inject new blood into the game (such as the organizations in the Executives and Other Criminals update), however again, those are for the rich people only, as is with most of the vehicles added in said update. Still barely holds up but Rockstar are still ignoring core problems and are only catering to the majority (hackers, grinders and shark card users) and ignoring the minority (poor people who didn't grind or spent their money on a car that got outclassed by a car that was cheaper and faster). Just look at Benny's, his cars are some of the fastest and the coolest in the game, but what's the catch? THEY COST A ♥♥♥♥ TON. 600k just so you can modify your car, and then after that the upgrades cost 40k EACH with about 20 customization options (some for parts of the car you almost never see).","August 22, 2015","false","296.9"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","25","35","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamninja28/recommended/271590/","iamninja28","Ninja","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamninja28/","211 products in account","Let me give an honest review.\n\nWhile I would recommend this game to friends, because the game itself is a blast, you must be warned that the company behind it has fallen from grace since this game's launch.  Yes, I play this game often, but I've learned to deal with the stress and anger the game can bring me.\n\nWhy do I say that?  Let's Break it Down.\n\nCompany History -  4/10\n\nSimple, Rockstar was a dedicated game developer from the early 2000's until right about 2013, the intial GTA V era.  2015 swings around and the PC version is finally ready, they release it to a pre-ordering public knowing the game wasnt launch-ready and recieve a wave of broken reports.   Two weeks later they remove the ability to get several guns and vehicles all because current PC players dont have or have played the console version.  Which means you have to spend $120 to get a few items.\n\nThen comes the infamous Summer Sale Scam of 2015.   Rockstar charging flat $60 for their game, whether you buy the base, a shark card that would undo the refundability of your game, or the game bound with another game.  Just massive profit whoring, just like with the Shark Card.   The Ill Gotten Gains Update added a plane costing $10,000,000GTA, and the Megaladon Shark Card of $8,000,000GTA is $100USD.  Which means the Luxor Deluxe, to Rockstar, is worth $125USD.   Absolutely absurd.\n\nSingplayer Playability - 7/10\n\nGTA V as a game is great.  It's aesthetically pleasing and flowing, controls far better than IV ever did, and just feels more alive than any previous installment.  While lacking the proper absurdity of game like San Andreas and Vice City, it was its own breed of good, and as a Singleplayer game, it was very pleasing.\n\nAs for the replayability?  The game becomes dreadfully boring after you beat the main story.  The game gives no incentive to complete the remaining 40% of the game once the main story is over, and you dont get hardly enough money from the final job to enjoy anything in the game.  The only reason Singleplayer gets a 7 out of 10 is purely because the main story is fantastic and well done.\n\nOnline Playability - 0/10\n\nI wish my scale went negative.  Everything Rockstar promised in Online simply isn't there.   "No hacking allowed" they said.  I'm yet to find a lobby without one.  "Instantly joins lobbies with your friends" they said.   Nope, every game I join always says my friends are in other games.   "Better anti-cheat software" they say, nope, if anything there has been a spike in hackers.  "More content: they say. Ill Gotten Gains was a money sink, not a content additon.   The game is pathetically boring after completing the 5 heists, that have no replayability to them, and farming countless missions, races, and deathmatches until you get sick of even seeing your own apartment.\n\nAmongst the personal issues with Online, there is also the issue that there is so much possiblity and hardly anything done to match it.  No realistic immersion to the game.  No bars, no car shows, no dance clubs, no cafes, no way to relax with friends, and only one club... a strip club.  The game is hopefully going to be adding mansions in Ill Gotten Gains part 2, which would grant more freedoms to players, such as owning a pool and a tennis court, but there needs to be more immersion.  The game only has 1 golf course, when there could easily be 2 more... 1 in the desert, and 1 in the mountains or Paleto Bay area.\n\nThe game also lacks any way of bringing the community together to do events, the only events that happen in free roam are chaos inducing ones, which a lot of players avoid.  There needs to be raves on the beach, or maybe even events like car shows or drag races that players can attend and spectate or participate in in free mode.  There's just sooo much the game can be, that it just isn't.\n\nThe most recent update also brought my average frames from 70 stable on Very High to about 15 and choppy until it crashes on the lowest settings.  Rockstar flat out broke their game, and even high tier machines struggle with it now.  They decided to combat mods and hacks by adding several hundred lines of false code to the game, which as a result broke the game, and left mods and hacks completely unharmed.  The game is broken and unplayable, and until it's fixed, very few people will be able to play online.\n\nGame Overall - 3/10\n\nThe lack of support from Rockstar's end, combined with the malestrom that is GTA Online, and the quickly overbearingly boring Singleplayer Mode, I have to say this game went from the best thing to ever happen to PC gaming to a sad excuse of how a good game developer can go bad very quickly.  Will i continue to play this game?  Yes.  I enjoy it, but there is a lot to improve on.   Will i recommend it to friends?  Yes, I enjoy playing with friends and the game is a great way to hang out with them.  But, will i recommend it to you?  No.  Unless you know more than 5 people who own it and play it regularly, it's just simply not worth your money.   Your time is of your choice, but dont give Rockstar your money.\n\n\nRECAP\n\n\nDeveloper Score - 4/10\n\nBase Game Score - 7/10\n\nOnline Game Score - 0/10\n\nNinja's Game Score - 5/10\n\nFinal Score - 4/10, Would not recommend unless you really just need something to waste time on with friends and be constantly disappointed in both the developing company and the community behind it when updates come out and break the game.  The Pure amount of hackers will drive you away quickly, and if they dont, Rockstar's endless attempts to get more money from you without any effort from them surely will.\n\nPlay at your own risk.","June 25, 2015","false","993.7"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","27","39","2","1"

When your plane land, you have to do a race to get used to the driving mechanics (is my best guess, as I'm not quite sure, even after 2 years why).\n\nI recommend getting used to the game (in either singleplayer, or invite only lobbies with your friends) before you actually start playing online, though, as there are a lot of douches in online; not everyone, but there are a lot of douches that will kill you with no reason whatsoever.\nThere are also been a lot of hackers lately, some might be doing it for just the money and mean no harm, but I know that there are people that have hacks that allow them to teleport to you, and blow you up with 1 button etc, and that's the reason why the score is, quite low.\n\nOnline lobbies6/10\nController support / Port\n\nThe port to PC was amazing, as far as my knowledge goes the release date has been moved either 2 or 3 times before it got released, but hell, it was definitly worth the wait!\nThe game runs amazing, even on my old GPU that was only 1GB!\n\nI personally use a controller to either drive or use planes/helicopters in GTA because I'm used to that, as I played it on old-gen consoles for 2 years.\nIt's quite easy to get used to the driving and flying with keyboard and mouse too, it's personal preference really.\n\nController support / Port8/10\nGraphics & Sounds\n\nThe graphics in the game are just hands down amazing, I mean just take a look at the community hub screenshots!\nThere's reflection when it has rained and there's water on the ground, there is the most amazing weather effects I have ever seen in a game, as me and my friends just love being outside in the rain in GTA: Online, the lightning effects are just amazing, the game looks amazing in general.\n\nAs far as it goes for the sounds, the sounds sound really high quality.\nWhen I switched to a 7.1 headset, I even heard metal falling on the ground when cars exploded, that's how realistic and high quality the sounds are!\n\nGraphics & Sounds9/10\nReferences to older GTA games\n\nNot much to say about this, I only noticed this a day ago.\nThere's a group of artists walking around with mexican hats, walking around with instruments etc, and if you don't know, its a reference to the first ever GTA, where there was a group of people dressed up like Elvis walking around the city.\nWhen I found this out I was litteraly yelling at my friends because of happiness, because it felt really nostalgic.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/himesaminako/recommended/271590/","himesaminako","The","http://steamcommunity.com/id/himesaminako/","91 products in account","The game runs beautifully and looks gorgeous, even on lowest settings- but it's hard to enjoy the scenery when you're being exploded every other second.\n\nThe online portion of this game has some very awful business practices implemented and very little action taken against malicious cheaters. Every session I've played in online (this is no exaggeration) has had at least one malicious hacker who would spawn too much or explode everyone- something of the sort. And while you would think that Rockstar would have a greater grip on such large-scale server affecting hacks- basically nothing is done to counter malicious hackers and it's up to players to enter Passive Mode to temporarily escape the death effects or leave the server and find a new one.\n\nThe grind in the game is also very real. Earning money and RP is ludicrously slow, and nothing you buy scales properly. You can tell they've really made it a grind so as to encourage buying Shark Cards. Prime example: A yacht in the game costs approximately $8 million, and that's not even fully customized. A Shark Card that gives you $8 million in game costs $100 CDN. A not-fully customized yacht in the online portion of this game costs more than the game itself. In a heist you'll probably get $250,000 on average (i dont know, i havent played too many because finish both the setups and the finale itself requires a very coordinated crew), but that's after doing the heist setups and finale. It takes at least an hour to do all of that, so it will maybe take you at least one hour and probably a half to make $250,000. And this is with a supposedly coordinated crew- have fun trying to play Heist Setups and finales with random players- it will take many, many tries that will often make you feel like you're greatly wasting your time.\n\nTo build onto that, players who have spent much time are rewarded well as their level is higher and thus unlock more content- that's nice and all, but what this means is low-level players are locked from using many items. I've got 80+ hours clocked in GTA V Online and I'm only around Level 50. You stop unlocking items at Level 120- and you only really get the higher end stuff towards Level 90+. It's outrageous, and what it really does is put higher-levelled players on a higher-level ground than lower-levelled players- it's not a difference in skill when it comes to a one-on-one snipe session with an enemy- it's a difference in level, as the newbie will have the weak sniper and the veteran will have the one-hit-kill sniper. Maybe you can't shoot down someone's helicopter efficiently because of your weak rifle- but your enemy can definitely shoot yours down with his Level 120 Minigun. The RP Level System puts older players on a higher-level ground not because of experience and skill gained, but simply because they straight up have better, upgraded items than those of lower-level players. A great imbalance of items and unlocks tilts the game towards people who are higher levelled, and those who are lower-level will have an even harder time catching up.\n\nAnd to further build upon the grind point, the only real viable solution to obtain money is to hope a hacker comes into the server and instead of exploding everyone decides to spawn money. It's funny, these kinds of people who spawn money for everyone because of the horrid payouts is the one who gets banned. From what I've seen, Rockstar's Anti-Cheat system is only efficient in catching people who spawn money- who cares about game-ruining hackers? You must buy Rockstar's Shark Cards for outrageously expensive prices like $100 CDN for that yacht, OR you can grind for $250,000 an hour with a coordinated team to get 1/32th closer to buying that Yacht.\n\nNot to mention the shady business practices where Rockstar purposely tries to make the game seem like it's discounted for lots but it's really not- it's actually a bundle of GTA V and a Shark Card you don't care about that artificially raises the price of the game and thus raises the sale percentage.\n\nAll in all, you'd have to grind to get anything worthwhile and Freeroam is rather boring if you're not roaming with someone else. Pray that maybe you won't get blown up today and that maybe someone will start dropping money- that's about all you can do.\n\nA horrible, long grind which encourages horrible business practices along with the extreme lack of hacker and malicious cheater countermeasures really turns me off from the Online portion of this game. It's fun when with friends- but everything else is just ridiculous and unprofessional.","December 20, 2015","false","195.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","13","14","0","8"

They need to be either really good or so disappointing and terrible that I feel that I should warn others not to play.\n\nGTA V comes into the latter...\nFirstly, before I tell you why, I am only disgusted by GTA online. The single player component of the game is great and I have played it through both on PS3 and PC  10/10 would  lose everything on the in-game stock markets and go on a hooker murdering rampage again.\nGraphics are excellent on PC btw.\n\nOnline was the game disappointment of the year for me though. For a few reasons which are hard to explain unless you've played.\nThe most annoying thing is the loading screens.... so many. Some have likened GTA V online to a loading screen simulator.\nIt is ridiculously hard to play with friends (PC only apparently) You can become friends with your mates via the Rockstar social club  but it means very little. It does give you the option to Join your friend -which you will use a lot because every time you try to join a mission looking for players or when you complete one it will load (again) you into separate sessions (instance, server etc)\nWhich brings me to my second most hated thing - the missions. They are very difficult to get your hands on.  You will be running around the city and an invite will pop up (automatic) so you hit join and bam loading screen. Then you may or may not get to the lobby. If you don't - bam - loading screen. If you do your chances of successfully joining that mission are low. Especially if you are low level because you will be a liability (death means restart). Most of the time you will be kicked to make room for better players or the host will leave and you guessed it bam  loading screen and you're dreaming if you think they'd let you continue from what you were doing when you accepted the fruitless invite.\n\nIf your friends tried to join the mission with you  horrah  you get to use the join friend button again because you will have been loaded into different sessions. More loading.\n\nLastly - most likely due to the game being super difficult to play the way it was meant to be - Griefers, griefers everywhere.  Depending on your definition of a griefer GTA V online is full of them. All player characters appear on your mini map so there is no hiding and the whole thing turns into a grief-fest. You get killed by players with far superior gear and then they wait for you to respawn maybe 100 meters away and they kill you again  :D such fun, The only way to escape is to find a new session bam loading screen.\n\nSo to wrap up. Could of been great. Isn't, better chances of enjoying it if you aren't playing with friends, offline is worth, interface needs a rebuild.\n\nThe end.\n","October 27, 2015","false","45.6"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Unfortunately cons outweigh pros, generally speaking.\n\nLoading times in GTA Online are outrageous. I find myself spending far more time staring at loading screens than actually playing the game. Sadly, this isn't an overstatement.\n\nYou will actually spend more time twiddling your thumbs in lobbies and in front of loading screens waiting for sessions to find players and maps to load (?).\n\nYou'll also be frequently confronted by cheaters. I have witnessed players:\n\n- using godmode\n- spawning all weapons\n- giving me all weapons\n- shooting money at me\n- spawning mountain lions on top of me\n- spawning tanks everywhere\n- spawning police with rocket launchers\n- monkeys and pigs driving cars\n- UFO's rammed into the road\n- A mannequin prop positioned on top of my head\n- etc, etc, (simply allow your imagination to go rampant)\n\nDon't even get me started on heists...\n\nYou'll find trolls. People bailing mid game, commiting suicide, blowing up objectives, etc. This simply leads to frustration and, needless to say, a never ending chain of lobby - load screens which will inevitably lead you to give this game the finger, at least as far as online goes.\n\nIf you don't hate yourself, just stick to story mode and try to appreciate the steps tecnology has taken within the gaming world.\n\nYou might think a downvote isn't warranted in this case.

Heists are especially exhilarating and tense.\n\n-tons of extra things to do,side missions,activities,collictables,business to own (some with their own side missions/collectibles)\n\n-Los Santos feels alive,pedestrians go on about their business and react realistically to what happens,police chases criminals,ambulances try and save casualties,several places offer extra activities,movies,tv shows play regularly on tvs,heck you even get a lively internet with sites to browse,videos and a few side mission opportunities.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-a few vehicle and world textures remain horribly low res\n\n-very few annoying points in certain missions,due to stunt jumps or unclear directions\n\n-with the world map being so large sometimes driving to a mission can get a bit dull\n\n-first person view usefulness is generally a bit limited\n\n-might need a bit of fine tuning (both ingame and in your gfx menu/windows priority) to work smoothly\n\nGTA V is a game everyone'd try at least once and for a few hours,it provides an amazingly fun experience and manages to keep its quality for its whole duration,no matter if you're doing a main mission or just randomly driving around.\nI had no problems buying it full price and playing through it again despite having done it already when it first came out on consoles.\nYes,it's THAT good.","May 9, 2015","true","38.7"," 34 of 54 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","34","54","7","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverforte/recommended/271590/","silverforte","Forte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silverforte/","43 products in account","This review is NOT for single player mode. If you don't care about Online, ignore my review. If you're curious about the Online component, read this. Don't downvote my review because it's about Online. Online is part of the game.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let me make this perfectly clear. I do not care about single player mode myself. I only care about the online. This review is about GTA: Online. The singleplayer experience is amazing. If you are thinking about buying this for the singleplayer and you enjoy sandbox games, do it. Just avoid GTA: Online.\n\nI'll state some positives. First person mode makes this an entirely different game. It's truly amazing especially in cars. I will say the guns are noisy in first person mode. They just click and clatter way too much. I don't think real guns sound that flimsy but it's not a big problem. Driving is tight, it feels exactly like it should. Cover can be a bit annoying but it's still fun. There's plenty to do in the online outside of assigned jobs, like events. Okay, now to the stuff that matters...\n\nGTA: Online has caused me more frustration than the first time I fought a Capra Demon in Dark Souls 1. I played Xbox 360's version of GTA: O for a long time before the next-gen ports were released. Several of its issues transferred over to PC. The load times are attrocious. It seems to be network related. ON ROCKSTARS END... At least 30% of my playtime is spent watching a load screen.\n\n30 seconds to get into a lobby. I'm in. I try to accept a job invite. 20 second load screen. Host leaves or game filled up while I was loading. Cool, get sent back to lobby and watch 20 second load screen. Lobby is full of hackers, okay, new lobby time. 30 second load screen. More hackers.\n\nCOOL.\n\nCops are a problem more than is reasonable. They are way too sensitive and CONSTANTLY interfere with PVP activity. I ran a test. Stood in the middle of nowhere, no players or NPCs anywhere near me. No traffic. I shot a silenced pistol at the side of an abandoned house. One star. Cop spawns 50 ft away, sees me. I flee. Two stars. That makes no f*cking sense. I try to hide, map shows they can't see me and that they are in search mode. None of them are near me. Suddenly, magically, they know where I am. It just randomly gives the cops your position. They are overwhelming, they don't stop spawning when you kill them which makes it no fun to fight them and they will kill you for walking in front of them. I got a star last night while I was parked. Doing nothing. Frankly, if the cops were tuned better and would just f*ck off, I'd be able to forgive most of the game's other flaws. The cops really ruin the online experience for me more than the hackers. Yeah, they're that bad. Losing them isn't the problem. That's a common misunderstanding when people complain about the cops. It's not losing them, it's how easily you get a wanted level and how easily it escalates. GTA 4's online had a no-cops lobby option, why does its sequel not?\n\nYour screen is constantly bombarded and flooded with box popups about events and job invites. You can't turn any of it off. You will 90% of the time have popups on the left side of your screen and you can't do anything about it. It's terrible and annoying. My nerves are grated from this alone.\n\nAs for hacking...\n\nAs in the past (Red Dead Redemption, GTA 4) Rockstar is doing nothing to deal with the rampant and clear-as-day hacking going on in the online component of GTA 5. Reporting does nothing and you can't fight back in-game. If reporting worked, these hackers would not have accumulated the vast hours of playtime or rank-ups they have. They'd have been dealt with before rank 900. Every lobby, someone is hacking. And it's not 'oh I couldn't kill him so I claim he is hacking'. It's 'this guy just spawned a windmill, teleported on top of it and jammed a button on his keyboard to remotely and instantly explode every single user in the lobby.' I have NEVER, not ONE time been in a lobby with other people and not been attacked by a hacker. Exploding people, shooting bags of money everywhere, giving people tanks.\n\nOne guy was with someone he just met in the lobby. Guy A hacking, Guy B friend. 'A' tells 'B' he'll teleport him to people with bounties and help him kill them to claim the reward. Warps to me in an underground subway station, kills me, takes the bounty. Repeat for 30 minutes. Another guy crashes a jet into me, same crew by the way. I say 'Hey, same crew', he says 'f*** crews'. I unload half a clip of an assault rifle into him at 15 ft distance, he loses ZERO health. Kills me, I accuse him of hacking. His response was 'suck a d*** fa***t'. Should have known the guy with no shirt, skater shorts and shoes, a sideways ballcap and full body tattoos flying a fighter jet over the city wasn't a classy individual.\n\nLet me explain something to you hacker dipsh*ts. If I'm the type of person trying to get the legit experience of the game that I paid real life cash for, level up, earn game money like a grown up with more than two braincells, and you shoot twenty million dollars at me, you just totally ruined the experience for me. Now you've taken the incentive, the journey, to growing my character away from me. I have no more reason to try to earn cash, to do jobs, to do heists, to be careful. You killed that for me. Ever hear the expression 'it's not about the destination, it's the journey'? That's because if I have all the f*cking money I could ever need then I don't need to do the content to earn money!\n\nIf you even EXIST in the game with cheats, you've imbalanced the playing field. You do not exist as a player who can die, who has the same disadvantages and advantages I have because you don't need to do anything to earn anything, you just have everything! I can't kill you, I can't beat you in freeroam challenges and if we are doing a job together you're just going to cheat and speed through the entire thing. So why should I bother? People spend their hardearned money on this game and you f*ck it up for them. I don't want to hear that 'what if they're not bothering you' excuse. YOU'RE NOT ON THE SAME PLAYINGFIELD AS THE REST OF US IF YOU ARE CHEATING. Get the f*ck out and never come back. You don't deserve to play this game if you are such a coward and a lazy bum, the only way you can enjoy an online game is to give yourself a severe advantage over everyone else.\n\nIf you want this game based on the online, 5/10. Why 5/10 if hackers, cops and the interface are such big problems? Because the game itself is amazing. The driving controls, the jobs, the shooting mechanics, the first person. It's a good game but the state in which the online exists right now ruins the experience.\n\nRockstar... Hackers are preventing people from playing this game. I want to shoot enemies, take cover from fire, drive fast, make enemies and friends, earn cash and buy weapons and property. I can't do that when every time I log in I'm being torn a new one by a cheater. They trivialize the experience and need to be dealt with. The fact you are allowing them to do this like you have in all your past online games is, in my opinion, a scam because you continue to accept cash for the product and refuse to fix it. RDR, GTA4, you name it, it had hackers and still has them to this day. Try me, go log into RDR free roam right now... Yeah, you'll figure it out.","December 8, 2015","false","60.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","11","12","0","0"

While no game can truely live up to it all, this game certainly comes close. The Single Player--sorry, 'Story Mode'--is what you'd expect from a GTA game these days; long, fun and somewhat captivating. There's some silly moments in it (not quite San Andreas level, but pretty close) that keeps the more boring bits interesting and some great chase scenes.\nWhile I haven't even came close to completing the game at the time of this 'review', I still feel the game was worth the £39.99 I payed.\n\nNow, GTA Online; Oh boy...\nIt's hard to explain, or even define, but there's something about Online that makes it addictive. Much like your Skyrims, you're constantly wanting to get better stuff. Be that cars, boats, helicopters, jets, weapons or clothes, you're always after something new.\nYes, there are "lobbies" with much higher level players in there "destroying" us newer players, but they're not that frequent. Even when in one, you'll have some enjoyment getting your revenge (or go into "Passive Mode").\n\nWhile I brought the game for the 'Story Mode', I'm finding myself focusing more on the Online play.\nThere's some issues with lobbies randomly being "emptied" (in short, you are moved into your own empty lobby due to the Rockstar Servers claiming your rig or connection can't handle the current lobby), but you can still join "Jobs" with others no problem.\n\nIn short, I'd highly recommend this game to pretty much anyone.\nIt's great fun, has humour and is excellent value for money.","April 20, 2015","true","680.3"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","24","36","6","0"

Small things are important and gta 5 has a lot of them and you are not getting bored that fast , a lot of mini games and missions to play alone or also with friends. One of the better things are the heists , you need to cooperate with your mates to succeed. Gta 5 has also a beautiful, expertly realised open world who despite appearances isn't that small at all , a lot of things to do and areas to explore. One of the things that annoys you in Gta 5 is the amount of hackers you have to face every day in most encountered sessions but at the end of the day you can live with that .\n\nPROS + :\n-Fun, enjoyable and well written story.\n-A lot of missions to play either with friends or alone.\n-Beautiful graphics.\n-Gorgeous open world.\n-Heists.\n-Good customization for cars.\n-Characters are awesome.\n-Impressive degree of freedom.\n-First-person camera.\n\nCONS - :\n-Not that great MM.\n-Large number of hackers.\n-Character customization could be better.\n-Not enough choices that affect the gameplay further on the story mode.\n\nIn few words Gta 5 it's an amazing and fun game without doubt , it's like a next-gen remaster of what we have experienced and played so far. You can spend a large amount of hours playing with friends and you still will find new things to do every day . It begs to be played all over again especially when you have company. It's a must for everyone to try out. Those who didn't play that masterpiece yet , they definitely should !

I have to be completely blunt here. The amount of hackers that this game has online in the Public lobbies is absolutely atrocious. For the past 3 nights now, I have not been able to find 1..... not 1 public server without some idiot hacker on it. Ranging everywhere from freezing players to taking weapons to crashing my game and even sendng a 4.0GHz 32GB DDR3 RAM PC into a BSOD is absoultely horrible. It is unaceptable that you're conning people out of $60 for an online game that you do absolutely nothing at all to prevent hacking or modding in.\n\nAnd don't say that you do, because if you did, these no-lifes would have a fear of the consequences. I have sent emails to GTABanHammer, only for them to go unanswered after I've sent in all of the necessary details. To be quite honest, it has gotten to the point that me as well as many other players feel the need to take matters into our own hands and download said hacks in order to crash out these players and undo the mess that YOU allowed and continue to allow to happen when people get frozen, lost weapons, etc. Especially when these hackers choose to frame another player on the said server, and that player ends up paying thousands upon thousands of dollars for personal vehicle insurance claims, and in some cases, even gets sent to the "Bad Players Lobby."\n\nAnd don't even suggest to me to start a friends lobby or a crew lobby. Half the fun is playing with complete and random strangers online in huge lobbies of 20-30 people, but apparantly, you have made it where it's impossible to even do that. Do you guys really not care nor have any regard for the people that have purchased the game and actually want to play it as intended?

All i can say is i didn't realise i purchased "Loading Simulator 2020 HD Edition"\n\nKidding aside, to elaborate, of my '91hours' on record at this moment, its safe to say ive spent 3/4 of it loading! Holy Crap man.\n\n-On start up,\n-Online mode,\n-Missions/Heists\n--Starting them,\n--inbetween choosing more missions\n--finishing missions/heists\n(which constantly crash while loading which gets you locked loading with no way out other than to either Alt + F4 or try join someone elses game with Rockstar social club thing if anyone else is on),\n\nThough this is a personal niche of mine.\n--Cutscenes (that you cant skip & some you can after you have seen it before, if one person hasn't seen one before in heists sit back and watch a good 5min odd cutscene each time).\n\nThats just some parts that need loading.\nI know what your thinking "well of course you need to wait for loading stupid head!"\n\nAnd your right! good job fellow nublet. See now this wouldn't be an issue at all assuming loading times were minimal and the amount of times to load were minimal, but hey that would be too mainstream, 5min loading time average~ assuming you don't time out/Crash and need to load up the whole damn game from the beginning and as mentioned above there's just too much, if you want to make people load up 5 mins for 2mins of gameplay thats fine i guess, at least make sure it god damn loads up.\n\nNow lets get into things that need fixes.\n-like joining friends, sometimes you cant join friends from a number of issues, like having not done tutorial(even though you have done it before).\n-Also an issue where you may be buying stuff from convenience store dude for snacks, and if someone comes around and holds it up while your in it, you are stuck there, unable to move or get out, even after the thing is over.\n-Missing weapons, sometimes you lose weapons/lose all weapons and need to buy them all again.\n-idling time out, 2min idle time it seems. Which is fair enough but i personally think its too short, maybe 5mins.(only a problem since you gotta load in again yay more loading screens. Which funny enough if your stuck in a loading screen you cant idle out which is the only thing i can imagine the idle out being somewhat useful)\n\nIn fact, as I am typing this, I am stuck "Loading" Launching a mission for the past 10mins with no way out because you cant just press esc to leave, the only way out is to alt + F4 and exit the whole game and load it up from the beginning which takes about 5-10mins just to boot up. I just...... no words.\n\nWait Loading simulator 2020: HD Edition.\n\nALL that negitive aside, the game runs great when it works.

The single player is very fun, obviously. That being said, you SHOULD NOT purchase this game...especially not at full price. Rockstar is a disgusting company that only spits on its fans and  takes every cash grab it possibly can (e.g. a full priced PC and "next-gen" re-release long after the original game came out, and pulling any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t possible to avoid the Steam sale). You SHOULD NOT support Rockstar by purchasing this game, and i actually strongly recommend torrenting it instead.

Unfortunately this smelled like a classic "too Good to be True"\n\n\nComparsion:\nIts useless to compare Performance between completely different Games.\n\nBut in this case its possible to compare the performance to Max Payne 3 and GTA IV since they all run on different versions of the same Rockstar in-house engine called "RAGE".\n\nThis is not 100% accurate by any means, it only serves as a rough guess.\n\nMax Payne 3:\n-Good Port\n-Average Fps: 50\n-1080p, medium-High Settings, No AO/No AA\n-Looks and Runs great\n\nGTA IV:\n-Bad Port:\n-Average Fps 45 (but highly inconsistent, 15-60 fps)\n-1080p, medium-High Settings, No AO/No AA\n-Looks mediocre runs "meh" but more or less playable (like Ps3 with slightly better Visuals)\n\nGTA V:\n-Medium-Bad " Port* "  (does vary heavily for different Set-Ups):\n-Average Fps around 25-30, often drops even further down with heavy non framerate related stutter\n-1080p, Settings all on lowest, No AO/No AA\n-Looks very ugly on above settings, like a ps3 version that runs unplayable bad!\n\n*Port in quotes because allegedly its supposed to be entirely developed for PC.\n\n\nReport:\nOverall:\nIts pretty obvious that something somewhere went terribly wrong if the PS3 Version runs and looks better than the PC Version at similar Settings.\n\nI usually refuse to play at anything lower than my native 1080p (with success btw.) But GTAV struggles even at 720p on lowest settings, varying between 25-40 fps, which is just absurd.\n\nCPU related:\nThe Game is pretty CPU demanding. Altough i need to mention that my i5 quadcore seems to work fine most of the time. The Game multi-threads correctly, all 4 cores are at similar usage.\n\nBut sometimes the Overall CPU Usage strangely skyrockets to 90-100% completely irrespective of your ingame activities. I dont know why or how, i just noticed it twice while benchmarking with HWinfo64.\n\nGPU related:\nMaxed out it looks definitely pretty but as soon as you start to turn down settings things fastly become surprisingly ugly, despite the silly fact that they call the lowest settings "normal" in the options menu.\n\nAre you used to turn Texture on high and the rest to low to get the best possible compromise? Sorry, this is not possible in GTAV... if your VRAM is anything lower than 2GB, then youre stuck at the lowest possible Texture setting which looks quite lowres and muddy.\n\nRAM related:\n4GB is the minimum, period. Which, to be fair, is reasonable. Anything lower will cause a warning on launch and ultimately crashing in the Loading screen.\n\nHowever one issue is to be found here too, there seems to be a Memory Leak. After around 30-60min In-Game, Ram usage seems to slowly but steady climbing no matter what. 8GB Ram users are filled after around 4hours, 16GB users after ca. 8 hours.\n\nAnd 4GB users... well... we already start at ca. 3-4GB Usage and stay there because it obviously cant climb any further. Atleast thats my experience from the 2 Hour Test Session.\n\n\nConclusion:\nIm deeply disappointed, they delayed this multiple times for "optimization" and even praised it as a 4K capable performance wonder on every opportunity but it seems like many of those were empty promises.\n\nMax Payne 3 worked so well but this simply doesnt. I know MP3 isnt an Open World Title but i was hoping that GTAV with turned down View Distance and a tad lower settings would be somewhat similar performance-wise.\n\nWhat annoys me the most are the deceiving Minimum Requirements.\n\nMy PC exceeds the PS3 and the minimum Specs and when im looking at the Performance, its proven, that the Minimum Requirements are a blatant exaggeration of Optimism just to squeeze out as many sells as possible from financially low-grade PC owners.\n\nI would not write this review if the minimum Specs would listen DX11, 8GB RAM, GTX 550 etc. Then it would be my own fault to purchase a game that i dont have the Specs for. But thats not the Case so here it is:\n\nI do not recommend this for lower End Set-Ups.\n\nI hope this Warning does not come to late for people with similar specs.\n\nBonus:If youre more the visual Proof kind of Guy, check out the Video below that compares the Graphic between PC Low Settings, PS3 and XB360. You will be unpleasantly surprised, trust me.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=La9vzurVTlQ","April 15, 2015","false","52.5"," 39 of 64 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","39","64","3","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExLeee/recommended/271590/","ExLeee","ExLee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ExLeee/","149 products in account","I recommend this game but only to a certain degree, it's more like thumb sideways, and here's why:\n\nSingleplayer is probably where you will get your money's worth. It's fairly entertaining through out the whole game, depending on your personal tastes, and there is enough content to keep you occupied for at least 100 hours (if you are a completionist type). Admittedly the story is kinda mediocre and isn't going to blow you away with it's storytelling or big twists but the gameplay is fun and almost perfect for the first time in GTA series although previous titles had better story and atmosphere.\n\nThere is also Rockstar Editor for the creative types to make interesting videos and enough mods around to keep the game relevant way past it's life cycle. Just remember to revert your game back to vanilla before going to multiplayer because mods tend to be flagged as cheats and can get you banned, so beware.\n\n\nNow multiplayer is whole different beast. First and foremost it is very time consuming in the sense that everything will take a while to achieve. You can still have a lot of fun doing all sorts of jobs and activities with friends while being a low level with no money but you will be at a disadvantage at every corner. You need to level up to be more competent in missions to earn more money to buy stuff which is unlocked by being a high level and screwing around in free mode won't get you far. You have to literally work for your level and money which may sound discouraging for some people with little time on their hands.\n\nFor that case you can buy Shark Cards, in-game money paid with real money, micro-transactions if you will. You don't have to buy them (I certainly never did) but if earning money the usual way is a grind for you then there's this. Shark Cards are also the reason for the countless free updates as well as the reason why they abandoned singleplayer for good. Heists are the biggest money makers but doing them as a low level is a sure way to fail a lot and annoy your teammates. Personally I do not recommend tackling them before reaching level 50.\n\nAnd of course there are hackers. Every game has them but GTA 5 has quite a few of them thanks to the shoddy network infrastructure. You see this game uses "Peer to Peer" connection meaning technically there are no servers, in a lobby everyone connects to everyone. This makes for absurdly long loading times for connecting to public lobbies and transforms PvP into a chore where depending on your opponents connection it almost seems like a drop of a dice decides whether or not your shots will actually register.\n\nSo with no actual servers to run checks on people to know who's hacking, hackers are running rampant thanks to the netcode. That could be fixed with dedicated servers but the last modding team that tried to mod that into GTA 5 got their SC accounts permabanned, so yeah... And Rockstar's own methods to remedy that by screwing with the code have instead caused a 10% - 20% decrease in performance for a lot of people. The game may never run as smooth as it did on launch day :(\n\nHacking got better these days but still my advice for now is to avoid public lobbies and just stick with your friends in private lobbies instead. You'll also get the added bonus of faster loading times in private sessions :D\n\n\nBottom line / TL;DR :\nIf you're a single player person then this game has you covered with fun gameplay but with a so-so story while multiplayer, although fun at times, requires from you a lot of time and a lot of patience to put up the bull s**t it often throws at you.","October 28, 2015","true","808.3"," 21 of 31 people (68%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","68","21","31","4","0"

Even if you attempt at force to have decent laughs with SP, well ♥♥♥♥ you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, get banned from the "Social Club" (WTF is that name even) and never play the Online, not even the SP (!?!) due to A ALLWAYS ONLINE DRM FOR ACTIVATION.\n\nSo, if you are BANNED, you cant activate the game, BECAUSE YOU WONT BE ABLE TO ♥♥♥♥ING PLAY IT.\nThis is downright illegal for me. WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING, ITS YOUR RIGHT TO USE IT FOR YOUR PLEASURE.\nMods were the core of the GTA community, and to see ♥♥♥♥♥tar doing this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t is downright depressing.\n\nThats not all tho, let me tell you why you shouldnt buy this , or even play it pirately.\nThe reason why I have 25 hours is because I only played online. I had beaten to 78 % the story on PS3, so why not just do the online?\nNope.\n\nUpdates made my game borderling unplayable. My PC could run it pretty at the launch, and it wasnt so bad for me. Less  resolution and there you go. After 2 updates, the game simply was a mess. Texture loss, fell from the map, LAG LAG LAG, timed out, FPS loss when doing ANYTHING. Fixes incoming they said, wait a bit they said. HAHAHA.\nThe hackers now roam the game. Many I know just dont bother anymore to join, because they are afraid they'll get banned FOR OTHERS MISCHIEF. Or it could be that south american servers are crap, and never work well.\n\nMe thinking that waiting a while would solve this. Me realize that it will never happen\nThe game is getting worse,worse and WORSE and I'll never ever play it again due to all its issues.\nI feel ripped off. I cant refund the game due to playtime, and I want God Himself to punish me for helping feed these greedy devs.\n\nHere are some more wonderful reasons to avoid this ♥♥♥♥\n\n* They buffed the price to go on sale ... to the original price. Yeah, its greedy alright. Lets not forget the silent song removal from GTA SA due to expired licences.\n\n* MICROTRANSACTIONS FOR ONLINE MONEY. WHAT. WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥.\nYou go saying " make the game fair " but a rich ♥♥♥ kid can just have BILLIONS for a couple of clicks and a stolen credit card? Absolutely disgusting and shameful\n\n*Online is just a boring mess. Lag, timed out, takes too long to do anything, people rekt your freeroam, OP Rocket Launcher makes driving in peace impossible, terrible servers in South America, hackers impersonate you and get you banned, hackers give you money and get you banned, hackers explode you and get you banned, and lets not forget the cherry of the icecream  ; HACKERS NEVER GET BANNED.\n\n*Updates making the game run terribly for some. I know a guy who simply modded SP, and updates made the game disasterous in his super machine. Deleting the Mods, THE ISSUES WERE SOLVED. Why you do this ♥♥♥♥ ?\n\n*They banned multiple modders who just wanted actual fun. This includes a online mod that people could play in peace.\nMy guess is " OH NO, YOU WILL PLAY ON MY ONLINE ♥♥♥♥♥. OH AND BUY A SHARK CARD"\n\n*Online is a ♥♥♥♥ing grindfest. Let me say something tho, a game like Payday 2 has grinding, but atleast you dont spend 30 min waiting for a lobby and again and again due to disconnection.\n\n* First Person mode , while sorta good, is TERRIBLE for combat and generally anything. Its a cool gimic with  x5 more chances of getting you killed for being unable to recon the battle right due to limited view.\n\n*Did I mention hackers wont get banned? And actually, hacking is getting worse according to users, NOT the company?\n\nJust NO. Not even SP can be trusted due to possible bans for YOU having FUN, which apparently is against the SocialCLub policy.\n\nThe base game was great, it was a very well crafted world and a decent story with good protagonist and missions, but the company behind it seemed to looked out for a way to ruin it as much and as far as they could.","August 19, 2015","false","29.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","2"

(Being able to see more at either side is an advantage, for any of you 'slow' in the head people trying to defend it)\n\nAnyways, onto the main review;\nI'd never played any of the console versions of GTA V, so I've come along as a fresh newbie.\nSo far, I've been completely wow'd by the whole experience. The city feels so alive with the pure density of NPCs and some of the views are absolutely breath taking.\n\nThe story is, in comparison to GTA IV, about just as gritty. It's however dampened by the amount of humor piled in, with a lot of help from the amazing acting work. I'm not quite sure how long I've spent on the story mode alone, but rest assured, there's a lot of content to ensure you're playing it for a good while.\n\nOnline mode is simply amazing. Granted some people on there seem to be blind to the fact that this isn't GTA IV Freeroam; There's so much more to do, cooperative missions and activities alike are very abundant. When you're tired of shooting things up, stop and play tennis with a friend, or arm wrestle some random dude who's way stronger than you for a laugh. Heck, go skydiving with your buddies and take in the amazing views as the Sun begins to set.\n\nThis game has far exceeded my expectations, especially in comparison to GTA IV.","May 7, 2015","true","228.3"," 48 of 82 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","48","82","3","0"

Sadly I can't. Yes the single player is amazing immense etc I loved it.\nBut as for most people for me it would be about the online. Here are some facts:\n-no anticheat or any possibility to filter hackers online. Hackers ruin free roam mode. They freeze you in a spot they spawn UFOs in front of your 3 million game dollar costing jet that you had been farming for 4 days non stop heist and missions, they have miniguns which shoot moneybags, corrupting other players who are BEGGING for these internet gods for pennies, not realizing that it ruins their game too as there will be no value for them to buy anything. They use godmode autoaim etc you stand no chance againist them. They hold all the races' world records with like 20 milliseconds(!!!!!!!!).\n-still no joystick support (I never played with a joypad and I'm not planning to do so. I bought a £50 costing joystick ONLY for this game to learn that it is so console smelling that the dear creators ignored to put joy stick support into the game. I made it work through a profiler program that makes it kinda work although it is not the best solution because it mimics keyboard not a joypad and it was a pain to set up and now as the trial expired it wants me to pay for it too.\nRockstar's excuse from a pc release was the torrenting. Like others, I paid good money as soon as it was released as I pay for all the games I like and play. Rockstar your argument is invalid we paid to play. And sadly we paid to play a game that COULD HAVE BEEN the best game ever created. I could speak hour about the beauty of the landscape, the nice sunsets the effects and everything. Sadly it is dwarfed by those issues I mentioned and it is just a part of it.\nHere is this nice new DLC how is it called? Ah: ill gotten goods. Yes it is ill, it brings you a few shiny cars, jets, jewellery whatever. It just doesn't bring the change that was promised. Servers are still full of hackers, my joystick still doesn't want to work (guys you developed on pc it is not a console why do you want to force me to buy a console controller???) and the mouse control is still very console like.\nI am very disappointed, probably like many others.\nYes buy the game, play offline then uninstall it and forget otherwise you just get mad because of the lack of caring in online.\nThe funny thing is that rockstar is selling game money so the hackers are killing their business too, they still not care.","June 13, 2015","false","809.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It took a while for Rockstar Games to make a PC port of GTAV, but it is totally worth it and I recommend the PC port the most out of the consoles. Great story, great characters, great graphics, this game does not disappoint you. Oh yeah, and don't forget first person! Hell yeah. Is it the best Grand Theft Auto game out of the series? Probably. You might find it weird if I compare this to GTA: San Andreas but in a way, GTAV is better mostly because of graphics. But graphics don't usually matter to me like Fallout 4. It's hard to point out the negatives to this game but there really isn't. If you have the money, definitely go out and buy it, it's worth it... If you can run it though. 9/10, partly because people being permanently banned from GTA Online for simply just installing an FOV mod and other mods.

Everything that is legit is awsome, but there is more hackers here than i have ever seen, and it WILL ruin the game, they can send u money wich sounds great until it gets your accound banned. Cant kill them, they spawn a million of you around you with green hair, its seriously ridiculos. The past two days, i have not been able to find a lobby without hackers. love the game, wanna play it, but im just gonna put it on the shelf for awhile, every pc game has hackers but NOT LIKE THIS idk if they just made it really easy or what, but im just done, i cant even get into a legit match becuse every time i get in sumwhere its just sum lame script kiddy trying to show off his lame little hacks like i couldnt do it myself if i was that much of a loser. get it together rockstar and monitor the game already.\n\nONE YEAR LATER\nNow nothing that is legit is okay. there are more bugs than i can deal with. like for ONE example. they release The roosevelt car again, SWEET i missed it when it was for sale on xbox. so i save up forever to buy the million dollar one. and at the same time i have a lowrider car (faction) bought the lowrider upgrade and sum cosmetic stuff for it, spend alot of money, then one day i go to my garage and my crew emblem is on my car, dont want it there tho. so i go to the shop, it has not been purchased yet, but when u back out from looking at it, the emblem goes away. okay cool. they rest of the time i play it is gone. but when i play again and reload the game. Bam there it is again. Now some might say, why does a simple emblem on you car bother you. if its so simple why cant it just simply work right ant NOT be there when i dont want it to be. so i sell my lowrider because sumone said that fixed it for them to just sell it and restart, so i sell my lowrider loose alot of money. then buy the million dollar roosevelt. and guess what is on my car after the first time i reload the game. so now if i sell my roosevelt, i get like half what i spent on it.....so i realized i was done. so basiclly this game is still crappy online experince for pc players, i wish i never would have got it and waisted my time and just let it die with my desire to play consoles. the hackers have not changed, still in every lobby. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. it is pathetic that everytime i try to play a rockstar game i always end up falling back on a modded ONE PLAYER game that i have basicly created myself, because it is more stable than anything i get from rockstar. if i could get my money for the game, and all the other stuff i have got over the years back, i would. I will never open this game back up again, and it is not my job to constantly send rockstar support tickets reporting bugs for them for free when they are supposed to PAY PEOPLE to do that in the first place. i play online beta games still in beta that i dont need to sent this many support tickets in. These people are lazy or just plain stupid, either way i am at my breaking point. i spent my money, i waited all this time, if u guys still cant get your s*** together then il just know never to buy another crappy game from this company or ever say anything but f*** that f****** piece of s*** game dont play that s***.  Suck it rockstar im sick of you.\n\n\nEVEN MORE BULLS***\nSo i caved and even tried to submit a support ticket, and it reminded me everytime i have ever tryed to submit one, i always have a hard time submitting it, so i write out my long BUG REPORT for these F****** for free do half the job for them, then the sumbit button will not work, copy  to a new one, wont work. THIS GAMES SUPPORT SITE HAS SO MANY ISSUES U CANT EVEN SUBMIT A F****** TICKET FOR HELP. either way thats it, end of story, whenever i feel like waisting the time to try and get this off my f****** list of games i will, i probobaly wont even try and get my money back out of fear for having to see this games stupid F****** name ever again. ROCKSTAR NEEDS TO STAY THE F*** OUT OF THE PC WORLD AND GET BACK TO SERVICING LITTLE B**** A** CONSOLES THAT ONLY LITTLE KIDS PLAY. PEACE ROCKSTAR I HOPE U ALL LOOSE UR JOBS ND GET REPLACED WITH PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THE F*** TO DO WHEN U CANT EVEN SUBMIT SUPPORT TICKETS AND PEOPLE TELL U AND U NEVER DO S*** ABOUT IT.\n\n....................,/¯../\n.................../..../\n............./´¯/'...'/´¯¯`·¸\n........../'/.../..../......./¨¯\\n........('(...´...´.... ¯~/'...')\n.........\.................'...../\n..........''...\.......... _.·´\n............\..............(\n..............\.............\...","June 13, 2015","false","272.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I'm loving this game so far.  The voice acting and story are both top notch. Assuming that you have played Grand Theft Auto games before this, you will feel right at home with the open world nature.  I'm not too far into it yet, but there is already a ton to do and places to go within the game.  In the past, you couldn't really interact with much outside of the cars, ammunation, and a few other places.  Now, there is a ton of stuff to do. You can play tennis, and the tennis is actually better than most tennis games available on Steam. You can play golf and the golf is as good as any golf game available on Steam. I haven't gotten around to anything else yet but I know there's more. There are a ton of vehicles to use including bikes, dune buggies, ATVs, Wave Runners, boats, planes, tons of cars, trucks, motorcycles, etc.  The game is optimized incredibly well. I have experienced no bugs so far.\n\nAgain, I'm not even very far into the game yet and I'm having a blast. I can see myself goofing around with this game for a long time to come. If you're a fan of the series or open world games in general, you should check it out.","January 26","true","9.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

I was itching to see what it would run like on my now middle aged gaming rig but that 780ti lurking in there still chews through most stuff with ease.  The game ran at what looked like fairly maxed out settings at a smooth 60fps.  The reflections in the cars at night I found particularly eye catching.\n\nAt one point I noticed some mountains in the distance.  So I caught some dude at the traffic lights, proceeded to beat him to death in the street with my bare hands, stole his motor cycle and headed for the hills.  After a few mins of some crazy motorcycle action on the back wheel on the wrong side of the road (much like Kerby Lonsdale on a sunny Sunday afternoon really ;) -jk ) I reached the foot of the mountains, a bit worried that the sports bike would not be up to the job of an off road mountain climb I ventured fourth anyway.  My trusty steed held the ridge line like a mountain goat and soon I was at the summit, well, high up anyway.  About 100 yards to the right of the (I think) "VINEWOOD" sign.  As you look out over the city below the view you are greeted with is nothing short of spectacular!  I can't wait to see some of the sunsets.\n\nOnly, when I can play :(\n\nI think I'll give it another half an hour of trying to get it working, then I'm gonna go play tf2.  I'll update this review if I get it working.  In this case - no news is bad news.\n\nEDIT :\n\nOk, update time!  Deleted the local content before I went to bed and re-downloaded the game.  Upon testing this morning the same loading screen issue :(  anyway I got fed up and wrote a ticket to Rockstar about the problem.  Checked back on GTA and it was still stuck on the loading screen so I went and got my car from the repair shop did a bit of shopping and when I got home the game had loaded!  Looks like I might just be looking at a 15min plus loading time, it might be longer, it had only been "loading" for 15 mins when I left the house, I was gone for about an hour.  Hope it's just the game settling in.\n\nThe game itself is running great.  Just completed a couple of missions.  The ability to switch between joypad and keyboard & mouse is superb, absolutely seamless.  Even the onscreen hint icons change on the fly.  Dropping the joypad for the shooting sections and grabbing the mouse is brilliant.\n\nI've even got the "Self Radio" working, was running a mission listening to an old rave tape of mine from back in the early 90's.  The problem with it though is there is currently no option to set the Self Radio as default, so every time you get into a different car you have to re-tune the radio, there is also no way of turning off individual radio stations (I'm sure this used to be an option...) ok, so it might be a small irritation.  But it is irritating me.\n\nNo worries you would think, this is PC - something like this will be modded in a matter of seconds.  Sadly NO.  Rockstar in their infinite wisdom have banned modding entirely, even for single player.\n\nLooks like they have been pretty liberal with the ban hammer too.\n\nThis decision is quite frankly gutting.  Rockstar, this is PC - not console.  I understand your decision regarding the multiplayer aspects but for single player?  Come on - disable achievements etc and let the community mod it to death.\n\nSo, in a show of solidarity with the modding community this review will remain negative until Rockstar pull their heads out of their arses and let the community mod the game.","May 4, 2015","false","24.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TomTomGoLive/recommended/271590/","TomTomGoLive","Tawmy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TomTomGoLive/","200 products in account","I write reviews so rarely. But this game needs one. Let me give you five reasons why.\n\n\n1st: The loading times.\n\nI have no idea why this game loads so incredibly long. I can basically get some coffee while I'm joining a session (or loading story mode, for that matter). It's not my connection and definitely not my computer. My friends have the same issues.\n\n\n2nd: The netcode.\n\nWhatever they did there, they failed horribly. It's incredible how this game just sucks your internet connection dry. I can play it. But everyone who does not have a 16Mbit/s connection or a slower computer has serious lags that make the game nearly unplayable.\n\n\n3rd: The stability.\n\nWhen the game came out, you were not able to switch back to fullscreen mode. The screen remained black and the game needed to be shut down. They fixed that one at least. I also don't get any crashes personally. BUT: I know at least three people who get them regularily, one of them is in my heist team, so we need to restart heists from time to time which sucks badly.\n\n\n4th: The Social Club.\n\nWhy the HELL does that garbage even exist anymore? Basically everything the Social Club does can also be done through Steam. When I want to open a party in Team Fortress 2 or Dota 2, I just invite people through Steam. So when you implement a DRM like Social Club in your game, why not just STEAM? The social features of Steam have NEVER failed me. Social Club does on a regular basis. Not only do invites not reach me often, even if they do, they are heavily delayed.\n\nBut the worst part about Social Club by FAR is the security. I have no idea if it is still the case, but in the first few weeks, THOUSANDS of accounts were stolen. Hell, a friend needed nearly two weeks to get his account back (at least he did eventually), and it was not because he had a weak password, but because even HE was able to get into other people's accounts after he researched a bit on the topic!\n\n\n5th: The most dickish move a publisher could actually make.\n\nWe write the 11th of June. People are eagerly awaiting the Steam sale to buy a game which has been out on consoles for YEARS now. They don't want to pay 60€ for it. Might be because they don't want to BECAUSE it is such an old game, or because they simply don't want or can spend that much money on a single game. Whatever is true, does not matter at all. They just awaited at least a -15 or -20% deal on the game as we always get during such sales.\n\nBut what happens? With the start of the Steam sale, Rockstar releases "DLCs" that just give you in-game money you can also get through normally doing heists. They bundle the game with one of those DLCs so the price increases to 75€. But HEY, people still want their sale, right? So we do a -15€ discount so the game basically matches the usual 60€ price tag! People will love that, right? RIGHT?\n\nNO, they freakin' don't! And while I DID pay the full 60€ when the game came out, I regretted it so much since then. And I was one of the people who defended Rockstar so much in the beginning. "Yeees, the game is years old, BUT that does not make the gameplay worse. It also has much better graphics than PS4 and XBone. It is even a good port this time!"\n\nSo while the story is pretty enjoyable, everything else about this game is not. It has pretty much destroyed it for me. I'm not sure if I will even finish the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ story.","June 12, 2015","false","46.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","1"

Playing singleplayer is great and you never get tired with all the activities you can do in the map. I really love exploring the sea and the wild life in the forest.\nI've waited 5 years for playing this game (since the first trailer), and my waiting was worth.\n\nOn the other hand, the multiplayer is completely GARBAGE!\n- Hackers\n- Has the ♥♥♥♥♥est matchmaking system I've ever seen. With over 40.000 players in-game DAILY, I rarely see a lobby with more than 3/4 players (in a lobby for 16 to 30 people). 90% of the times are lobbies with 2 players, and don't even try to create your own lobby, because NOBODY ever join. NOBODY!\n- Hackers\n- 8 years old kids\n- Hackers\n- Russians shouting in the microphone\n- More ♥♥♥♥ING hackers\n...and R* doesn't care at all.\nAlso, if I consider that they told to the modders that were doing another GTA V multiplayer mod to stop developing it, is making me cringe. So what are you waiting for fix this multiplayer and make it decent and playable? If you spend a part of your BILLIONS made with this game, for adding an anti-cheat and improving the matchmaking system, it will not be a tragedy.\nI never had fun on this multiplayer yet, and is not even 1/20 epic like Multi Theft Auto (GTA San Andreas multiplayer mod).\n\nSo, why I'm not reccomending this game? Because it's now worth the actual price (60€) for what it has to offer. The multiplayer is the main cause of all the bad reviews, and after 1 year since the release on pc, nothing is changed. Just buy the game ONLY during sales and if you want to play singleplayer...

I played the game for about 300 hours on PS3 so I went in knowing what to expect for the most part but I was nervous of Rockstars past reputation of PC ports. Needless to say this one feels very well done, there are still places where you notice controller priority most noteably the menus,UI, and aerial controls but most of this can either be learned realitively quickly or altered in key customization.\n\nOverall the game runs extremely smoothly, I have a higher end PC so it's hard for me to grasp optimization issues but I will say I can run on max settings with a 3 gig GTX 780 and a i5 4670k.\n\nThere has been the odd burp or glitch while playing with friends which did become an issue through some missions, one time a friend wouldn't load in another time a friend crashed but it's hard to say what targetted this and if it is a common issue. I can say for myself I have not once crashed or had any sort of game breaking bug.\n\nOverall my experience has been extremely positive, online works great, single player is fun, quite simply it feels like a Rockstar game and one that is finally a decent port to PC. I highly recommend this game if you enjoy the GTA series, this is definitely the best game Rockstar has ever produced.","April 14, 2015","true","102.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","12","16","2","0"

Playing Grand Theft Auto V is never anything but pure gaming nirvana, whether you're playing through the 69 mission story, mingling with Strangers and Freaks, engaging in Hobbies and Pastimes or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around in its enormously vast sandbox. There are fewer limits imposed on what you can do, with you now able to carry each and every weapon at once, making for some of the most glorious GTA rampages ever. There are also proper rampage missions, if you'd prefer to focus your vengeful wrath on deserving targets.\n\nCustomisation options are also plentiful in GTA V, meaning you can pimp out your weapons with scopes, suppressors and skins, and pimp out your rides with spoilers, skirts, turbo injected engines and so on. The world really is your oyster. If you can think of it, you can probably do it in GTA V. Wanna spend time walking Franklin's dog Chop? It's possible. Just want to go on a killing spree? Go for it.

GTA Online is a mess, with tons of loading screens, desynch issues and general issues. The singleplayer game runs fine, looks good, and is interesting story-wise, but is it worth 60 bucks ? I'm not convinced. The modding community is finally getting "official support", but I'm skeptic as to how long it will take before Rockstar actually does something to actually support modders, other than "not banning them". Wait for a GOOD discount, and for killer mods to come out. Rest of the review is older, but left here for convenience.\n\nCrashes, freezes, stuttering, memory leaks...\n\nThe port isn't horrible. Far from it. But waiting two years, two delays, and seeing four versions for consoles come out, anything that is worse than a "great port" is unnacceptable. We only have so much patience for one game. If you still have any, wait for a patch.\n\nEdit 1 : the Nvidia drivers that came through fixed most of the stuttering issues, but the memory leaks and the random crashes still happen, even though the game runs fine. Waiting is still the name of the game.\n\nEdit 2 : 23/04, still waiting for loadings improvements on GTA Online, and still has random crashes associated to random actions. Game runs well and smooth though.\n\nEdit 3 : 7/05, there's been some improvements for some users, and bug fixing for GTA Online. But there's been a lot of issues with modding, with the latest patch basically killing mods altogether and forcing users to downgrade their game to keep enjoying custom content. There's been bans from the game altogether (Singleplayer and Multiplayer) because of FOV mods, which is necessary to enjoy 1st person camera and not have a headache for some people.\nThe whole affair is a mess, and it's not a good incentive to spend money on the game.","April 15, 2015","false","27.7"," 82 of 147 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","82","147","5","6"

This game was a dream, I loved it even though I had already played it alot on Xbox 360. However, when Rockstar started to ban everyone who dared to mod their game, in SINGLEPLAYER, when we have payed $60 for this game.\n\nThe whole point with me updating the review, is that I cannot play the game anymore. Whenever I try to play the game, it loads and I'm able to play the game for a couple of minutes before it freezes. When the game freezes, it crashes with the following message "err_gfx_d3d_init". I know this WAS a common problem when the game was released, and there is ALOT of threads out there with potential "fixes". These fixes might help for some, but unfortunatly NONE did work for me. Rockstar have not published any official fix and the only respond I get from the support is "update drivers... bla bla bla".\n\nSpecs:\nIntel Core i7 6700K\nMSI R9 390 8GB\n16GB Corsair Vengeance LPX 2133MHz DDR4\nASUS Z170-A\nOCZ ARC 100 480GB SSD\n\n[OLD]\nI had alot of votes on this review, but I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ right now. You know why I bought the game AGAIN, after playing it on the Xbox 360? Because of the ability to MOD the game. Now when Rockstar is taking away the opportunity to play the modded game (banning everyone who mods, even in Singleplayer) I'm done whit this game.\n\nThis guy explains my feelings pretty spot on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UOWhOT7rnIo","April 13, 2015","true","118.6"," 669 of 1,248 people (54%) found this review helpful 593 people found this review funny","54","669","1","593","33"

Stamina, strength, stealth, and lung capacity are joined by a meter for their special abilities. These impact how long you can run and swim, of course, but also impact how well you handle recoil, climbing speed, take-off and landing in planes and helicopters, and so much more. If you want to bump up your flying skills, logic follows that you head to flight school. Similarly if you’d like to have a bit more stamina, then riding bikes, triathlons, tennis, golf and other physical activities will help with that. Other than specialty skills, simply doing more of something makes you better at it – practice makes perfect. This is not an arbitrary add, but one with real.\n\nAlso Graphically, Grand Theft Auto V makes the respectable presentation of its predecessor look pretty bland in comparison. What a difference five and a half years makes! Gone is the drab and depressing color scheme, giving players all the bright faux-California sun they can stand. Having lived in Los Angeles, many places in the world of Los Santos, San Andreas are familiar. The city itself is teeming with life, and I don’t just mean random pedestrians and cars roaming around. People go about their daily lives: traffic backs up, downtown is busy, Vinewood is full of shopping and mansions, Vespucci Beach has people skating and lifting weights, Blaine County is far more rural with rednecks and pink flamingos, and wind turbines spin in the distance like the real-world San Gorgonio Pass Wind Farm. The whole place feels organic, looks the part, and is more like a living world than ever before.\n","April 17, 2015","true","164.9"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","0"

Dont do what I did and have to restart my online character all over again.\n\nBut to cut to the chase, Grand Theft Auto 5 is a beautiful open world 3rd/1st person shooter filled with drugs, dead hookers, robbing granny's of their cars, and even more dead hookers. GTA V is the next segment in the GTA franchise after GTA IV which could be called a great game by some, but also could be called missed potential by others. But one thing is for sure, if you're a GTA veteran or you're brand new to the series, I absolutely believe that this game with be an instant favorite/top game in your steam library.\n\nGTA V takes place in the glamorous city of Los Santos (Los Angeles if you wanna be all realistic and ♥♥♥♥) a city full of life, money, dreams, crushed dreams, and happiness. you follow the story of a retired criminal, a young repo driver wanting more in life than being bossed around, and the psychotic yet loving and emotional CEO of Trevor Phillips Enterprises.

Rise up the ranks in your crew and spend hours grinding missions for cash that you'll end up blowing out your ♥♥♥ in the click of a button.\n\nPros:\n-Very well optimized\n-Hours of fun gameplay\n-Free add on updates often\n\nCons:\n-All I can think of is other players ♥♥♥♥♥♥ colored cars in Online.\n\n\nSo what the hell are you still reading for?

My introduction to GTA was through Vice City when I was a kid, and thinking back now really brings back the memories of how amazing and fantastic that game was.  I originally owned GTA V on PS3 a year or two back, but upgraded to PC for obvious reasons.  I was on a laptop, and was worried GTA V would be far too much for it to handle.  It was only recently a friend let me download and try GTA from their account (Love you, Geronimo <3), and surprise surprise, it actually runs decently on my laptop.  But enough of that.\n\nOn PC, GTA V is just perfect.  The graphics are so amazing, and the possibilities are endless.  The main thing I do is play modded GTA V, LSPDFR.  It is extremely fun and addicting to play the opposite side of GTA, and while Rockstar may not be happy with modders, I am very thankful for them.\n\nGTA V's story is keeping in line with its older brothers, although I will say this story is very unique in that you play as THREE different characters, and throughout the story, they slowly intersect.  When  they meet, this leads to epic missions with either two or all three of them, in which you can switch between them in the mission.\n\nThe main characters are the complete opposites of each other, and it's simply hilarious and brilliant.  Out of the three, Trevor is my favorite.  Rockstar did an amazing job putting this crazy, psychotic character together.  The sh*t he does and says will have you rolling.  While Trevor can be intense and very different from most people's tastes, I think the best part about him is that he is this crazy, law breaking Redneck hipster.\n\nAll in all, GTA V is an incredible game, and I love it.  However, there are two things.\n\n1) GTA Online is pure cancer. Every single lobby is full of either people that hack/cheat, stalk you and continually kill you, people in tanks/jets, etc.  GTA Online can only be properly played with friends.  There is peaceful mode, but that does not stop people, as there other things they can do.\n\n2) While Rockstar may not want to pay the real life vehicle makers to use their vehicles in game, I find it sad that Rockstar is unable to make the vehicles look real.  I've downloaded vehicle mods for all the police vehicles, and all of the mods are far more accurate.  The Police Stanier is a perfect example.  It's supposed to look like a Crown Vic, but it's not as close as it could be to being accurate.","April 26","true","95.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","3"

If you want GTA V for single player, 10/10 recommend. If you want to touch online, buy it on a console instead. Or don't buy it. Whatever**\n\nLet me start off by saying: I have been an avid GTA fan since playing my first and all consequent playthroughs of GTA III. They are amazing games, have always had stories that kept me wanting more and a great balance between good humour and serious game-play. GTA V is no exception to this, in fact, it hits a home run better than any subsequent game in the series.\n\nI originally bought GTA V on X-Box 360. I got the collectors edition, with the spiffy LS Cap and money bag. I took the week off work and I didn't leave the couch, except for bare essentials, for three days. I lived GTA V for those three days.\n\nTime came, the X-Box One was released, eventually R* released GTA V for that. So I bought it. The X-Box One wasn't what it should have been at release (another story for another time), so I ended up with a PS4 instead. I bought GTA V for that. Then, I decided to purchase another X-Box One. GTA V followed. Then a new graphics card, so I now have GTA V on PC. I love the game. It's a personal favourite.\n\nHowever, GTA Online is broken. It's that simple. Too many hackers dropping money, being invincible, blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. I had 5 million+ dropped on me, which for a day or two was absolutely awesome. Then it got boring. What's the point in doing missions/jobs/races when I have nothing to work for?\n\nThe servers are rubbish, often having drop-out issues, 'kicking' everyone from my lobby (actually kicking me but being subtle about it). The DLC is fast becoming pointless. It's too expensive and not anything new. There have been no updates for the story, either.\n\nI've spent a lot of money on this game, on in-game cash too (queue desperate loser comments, blow me) for it to be this broken. Improve it. You're good at what you do, R*. If you're not going to give us Red Dead on PC, or LA Noire 2, at least fix this.","August 16, 2015","false","140.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

(Though most of the people in the game are ugly as a bulldog's butt.)\nThe shooting is decent, not the greatest, but it works.\nMissions are quite amusing, and the storyline is probably the best yet for a GTA game.\nThere's also a lot to be said for the sheer detail of the world. It's amazingly immersive.\n\nIf you intend to play the game single player, get it. It's a great game. I'd easily say you should get it.\n\n"So why the negative review?" You may ask.\n\nWell unfortunately, as solid as the game is in single player, everything changes when you go online.\n\nTo start off, this is basically lobby waiting simulator 2015. Prepare to spend more time sitting in lobbies waiting for a mission or event to start, than actually playing the game. No, really, it's that bad.\nMany of the missions REQUIRE four players to even get started. This can take 10-30 minutes just to get enough people to actually join and be patient enough to wait for all 4 slots to fill. Sometimes even longer.\nGot enough players finally? Great! Welcome to headache #2.\nIf one player screws up, the mission fails and you all get kicked back to the lobby. The players get a chance to choose if they want to try again, or if they want to leave. If someone leaves, tough luck, it's back to the starting lobby and starting all over again.\nAlso get ready to get killed for your lunch money over and over again, generally speaking the player base is about as friendly as a roided up environmental activist on speed in a pit full of seal-clubbing ants. It's worse than kill on sight, because you show up on radar, so they'll literally go out of their way to hunt you down. I've met a few people that are nice enough on here, but they're easily the "less than 1%."\nFortunately the game will give you the option of switching to "passive" mode after you get thrashed, so players can't kill you anymore, but it also means you can't use any weapons. Cops on your tail? Too bad. You can no longer fight back as long as you stay in passive mode.\n\nI've saved the worst for last... hackers. Always out to ruin the day for someone, GTA Online is brimming with hackers, and Rockstar doesn't seem to be doing much of anything about it. There's a hack that's been going around for months that instantly kills all players in a play session, and can be set to make any player look like the killer. It also makes it almost impossible to access your menu, because for whatever reason Rockstar decided that it was so important to watch yourself die, that it cancels out all the menus until you respawn. (At which point you then instantly die again to all the hacks.) These creeps make the game flat out unplayable unless you switch to a solo or invite only mode. (provided you can get into the menu fast enough to pull it off.)\nThis is something that's needed to be fixed for ages now, but Rockstar is presumably too busy swimming in their money vault or something.\nIF you can get a group of buddies together to play, and IF you play outside of the public sessions, then online can be a lot of fun, but there's a helluva lot of trouble involved, and things that should have just been fixed by now.\n\nSo TLDR:\nIf you want to play single player, it's great. Get it.\nIf you're looking to play online: Prepare to wait, for headaches, and for hackers.","November 27, 2015","false","86.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Your chances of filling the lobby of a "job" are slim, especially if you dare to play anything that isn't cooperative. Player-versus-player combat is dramatically affected by each player's network conditions.\n\nGame performance has been made worse with updates since launch, and many computers running Windows 10 experience long periods of low framerate regardless of in-game events or background processes (even though the average frame both here and in other games is higher on Windows 10). Many graphical glitches, most noticably with grass and vehicle damage marks, have yet to be fixed.\n\nThere is no offical mod support for this game. In fact, there is a zero-tolerance policy with modding while connected to the Rockstar Social Club. This means that no aesthetic mods, including any desperately needed field of view enhancements, are allowed online, and even usage of mods in singleplayer will result in a ban.\n\nWhile still an expansive and well-made game, the PC version of Grand Theft Auto V simply is not an acceptable PC port.\n","August 18, 2015","false","765.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaketheoreo/recommended/271590/","jaketheoreo","JaketheOreo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaketheoreo/","109 products in account","There are so many reasons to dislike this game: Whether it be the unreliable servers/matchmaking, the abundance of griefers, hackers, & trolls, or Rockstar's own suspicious business practices. "In a world where hackers rule the online gameplay, where the creators want you to spend 100% of the game's value in fake money, and profiles get banned when a hacker (unbenownst to you) ♥♥♥♥s with your account (or you mod the singleplayer); You have to ask yourself: What was Rockstar thinking!?"\n\nWell, if I had to guess, it's very similar to their "Sale" mentality, which is: CRAZY (Crazy bad, not crazy good, bt-dubs... or the actions of a money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥). Have you ever heard of a sale on Steam where the game stays the same price, or goes up in price (OH, WAIT, forgot.. you do get a shark card! OH, WAIT, forgot... shark cards are useless to any actual gamer!). I have an idea, how about releasing the game for the actual 25% off, and letting those dumb enough to pay the extra 25% get the stupid shark card? Or, is that too much of a deal for Rockstar?: Of course it is...\n\nIf I had to sum up this review I would say: Avoid GTA 5, right now. Not because the game as a whole sucks, but because Rockstar has some SERIOUS work cut out for them before the online play becomes anything but trolls and hackers. Although, if you're in it for the singleplayer, then you'll have a blast (that is, until you try to mod your game, then you could lose your copy). If your not much of a modder, then you'll be right at home, but do realize that the new EULA put out by Rockstar has pretty much forbidden any third-party modifications to the game, threatening temporary to permanent bans from online (Disappointing, when I think back on how much fun GTA IV mods were). But, if all of that doesn't bother you, if you still have a good amount of faith in Rockstar, I cannot deny that it's a game with great potential (that potential is just being directed towards shoddy business practices, atm).","June 18, 2015","false","409.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

These practices angered a lot of avid gamers such as myself and needless to say it is revolting to see that games are being treated untruthful to the genre's original roots.\n\n2015 has not been a great year for games with promising titles such as Evolve, Dying Light and for the ps4 Order 1866 failing to deliver leading to disappointments for many. Doubts started to creep in and some suspect that even the best upcoming titles such as MGS: PP and even Witcher 3 might suck.\n\nAmidst the chaos, one star shines, above all, its gleaming, bright and pure radiance covered the sky full of light, hope, and dreams. This star is known as Rockstar.\n\nGTA V was originally released as a console exclusive and has received praise across the board with 10/10 ratings. I did not buy into the hype as I had little memory of playing GTA IV 5-6 years ago and so I hesitated and waited.\n\nSuddenly, Rockstar decided to port it over to the PC and when I say 'Port' I didn't mean Crapcom's lazy ♥♥♥ port with missing features and bad optimizations. I mean a whole new experience build from the ground up adding exclusive features, implementing bug-free experience, detailed PC settings that are both well optimized and greatly refined. The PC version is hands down the superior and most definitive way to play GTA V.\n\nThe Story\nThe story revolves around 3 characters allowing you to switch freely in between. The characters introduced are Franklin, Michael, and Trevor. Each individual has an interesting back story and personality with Franklin growing up in the rough Compton-like neighbourhood but is fed up with all the gangbanging and killing and instead wants to turn and make honest or perhaps fast dollars.\n\nLeading him into the shady world of doing vehicle repossessions and eventually meet Michael who is an ex-bank robber now retired, living off of the money from his final heist. Wanting a peaceful life seems to be too much to ask for and as trouble always come looking for him. With family on the line, Michael is now back in the game.\n\nTrevor, on the other hand, is Michael's brother in crime and from many years of doing 'Professional business' the two formed unshakable bonds. In everyday life, Trevor is one violent ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who runs 'Trevor Enterprise' a meth cooking laboratory. Nobody wants to mess with this psycho maniac as he will do anything to keep his business running smooth.\n\nThe world\nThe state of Lost Santos is a recreation of modern day Los Angeles and it is amazingly detailed, graphically beautiful and vibrant. Popular landmarks were represented accurately and are a wonder to look at. The world and its people live and breath the same air as you do and will react to everything that has happened locally or globally which is reflected in news and radio channels.\n\nThe size of the world is also incredibly huge containing varies geographical locations such as downtown area, desert countryside, narrow mountain roads and luxurious Beverly hills.\n\nTalking about radio channels, there are hundreds of tracks available and I rarely hear repeated songs. The tracks were well selected with West Coast classics being my favorite channel constantly play tunes from rap icons from Tupac, N.W.A to Snoop Dogg and many others instantly recognizable.\n\nMusic genres have rich varieties and there is something for everyone. In addition, you can import your own soundtracks into the built-in radio to create the self-radio and it can be shared and heard by friends on the passenger seats.\n\nVoice Acting/Animation\nThe voice acting were spot on the moment you hear Franklin talking with Lamar, each character feels realistic and packed with emotions that can be related to. Even the pedestrians will often talk to their loved ones or friends on the phone.\n\nThe animation and facial expression were on par with LA noir, creating the perfect balance between gameplay and storytelling.\n\nGTA V excels at the fact that it doesn't take itself too serious showing constant humor, racial slurs and stereotypical aspects of different cultures and races. It is well executed in GTA V as it makes the player feel integral to the community whether you are rich or poor or the areas you live in.\n\nVehicles\nGTA V offers a huge selection of vehicles with really well-designed handling and overall great driving mechanics.Cars were also smartly placed with richer areas containing more high-end sports and luxury cars and other areas containing more standard commuting cars and trucks on the countryside.\n\nBy simply driving around you will instantly recognize Audi R8, Bugatti Veyron, Porsche GT, Lamborghinis, and Ferraris.\n\nThe intricacies of the mechanics expand deeper when reaching out into the air as aircraft has totally different controls with some degree of learning curve and practices getting used to.\n\nMultiplayer\nGTA V is not complete without its popular online multiplayer. With Rockstar well-prepared launch, every single thing were fully functional since day one and I have not crashed once in my 50 or so hours of gameplay.\n\nCharacter creation has you choose the heritage and inheritance based on your parents to give a general outlook and an accurate template of the character. Which can then be customized further to become a unique representation of your online avatar. But choose wisely as other characters do not share levels, stats and money stored in the bank.\n\nAs you level up and progress the character stats you will encounter countless of activities all over the map whether you are into shootout, robbery or racing, there's something for everyone.\n\nThere are also plenty of competitive multiplayer modes to choose from standard team death match to car death match it has literally too many features and modes for me to list all here and you definitely need to play everything for yourself.\n\nFinally, online mode introduces heist once you reach level 12. If you think Payday has great heist, you might need to think again because GTA V's heist is definitely on another level. Heist has you assemble your own team and carefully selecting who's job is what and how it will be executed is the key to success.\n\nEach heist contains many smaller missions and these missions serve as preparation jobs. Once all the preparation jobs are completed you will unlock the finale of the heist. A longer, intense, action packed and adrenaline rushing action set pieces perfectly created by Rockstar. It really goes to show the high production value because it is mind-blowing fun. After 10 failures and 1 success, it makes me think I deserve that huge paycheck.\n\nFor hardcore players and the perfectionist, heists can be replayed to allow perfect plan execution for the mastermind. Completing extra challenges will reward you handsomely.\n\nWith 80% of my play time sucked in multiplayer, I have only just scratched the surface. There are still tons of content I have yet to experience and tons of missions I have not played. For the asking price of £39.99 it is absolutely a must buy as online alone will contain hundreds if not thousands of hours of gameplay and in the future more may be added.\n\nIf you ask me "Should I buy GTA V"\nI say "Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yeah"\n\nThe only aspect of the game I didn't like is the long loading time when transitioning from online to story mode and between screens when selecting missions but then again it is understandable considering the size of the game.\n\nRockstar pays attention to details in a sandbox game with unparalleled gameplay and extremely rich content packed with a fully realized world to experience in first person mode. GTA V sets the standard for what an AAA game should be and likewise, Rockstar sets the standard to how an AAA developer should make a game.\n\n10/10","April 18, 2015","true","216.0"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","1"

I personally, was able to find MULTIPLE easy use hacks, with a simple google search. The games online features are disgustingly unprotected, making playing it too easy, as there's people shooting millions of dollars in ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with their guns, yes, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that give you 40k when picked up, and their unbelievable use of god mode, explosive ammunition, weapons that aren't even available in multiplayer or for their version, like the rail gun, the tommy gun, the fireworks launcher, etc. What the ♥♥♥♥ rockstar, put some security on mp that isn't utter ♥♥♥♥, that people will put out hacks FOR FREE.","April 29, 2015","false","227.4"," 50 of 89 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","50","89","5","7"

I'm happy to report that GTA V is really great, would even call it fantastic if I came straight off IV.\n\n- Car handling is now more arcadey, which to me means more fun in this case. After around 15 hours spent struggling against IV's driving I just resorted to teleporting myself towards my objectives. V's driving is fun and made me launch the game just to drive around many times.\n- Quick save! No more trekking to nearest bed to save the game.\n- Player characters are, as far as GTA games go, great. I'd probably put all 3 of them into my 'Top 3 GTA protagonists'. Especially Trevor is really fun to play as. Switching between them is nicely utilized in missions to make them more fun.\n- The story is fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, it mainly consists of setting you up for some outlandish missions.\n- The map is big, detailed, and is made up of very diverse locations from a big town to small hickvilles in mountains or a desert. It might be a GTA-like games' sandbox map perfected. I only don't count is as my absolute favourite because it's based on America yet again.\n- I think every scripthook comes with a native trainer, which can really help you cut off ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when you're not in the mood for it. Or a quick way to get the wanted stars up if you find a nice place to make a last stand at.\n- Cars no longer catch fire when turned upside down! And what more, you can turn them over using the left stick. If you preffered a flipped car be the end you can still not use the new feature but hell, why wouldn't you.\n- Switching between gamepad for driving and k&m for everything else is smooth and all the prompts change correctly the moment you touch anything.\n- Plenty of weapon and car modification options and upgrades.\n\nSome negatives I encountered:\n- In a vanilla game you can't leave a car running without a lot of ♥♥♥♥ery.\n- Considering that a large part of the map is rural, there's only one country radio station. Easily solved by loading my Marty Robbins MP3s to Self Radio.\n- For some reason, the game was really choppy in borderless window while running smooth in proper fullscreen.\n\n...Rest of my gripes are teeny-tiny thingies that don't event warrant a bulletpoint.\n\nAll in all, the game kept me entertained for 78 hours, while I swore never to launch GTA IV again after some 25 hours (Base game + Episodes combined)\n\n\nSloth Academy rating:\n4 golden sloths\n__________\nAll this based on singleplayer only.","November 5, 2015","true","78.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/recommended/271590/","BloodCultist","Creeping Flesh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BloodCultist/","645 products in account","Summary:\n\nPositives:\nGreat visuals, Fun multiplayer, Optimized well, Amazing World, Great Characters and Great Narrative.\n\nNegatives:\nPoor mission design which are scriptfests that don't offer any freedom, Ridiculously Easy, A few mechanics which dumb the game down insanely.\n\nGrand Theft Auto returns in the same fashion it left off, an open world action game that gives the player freedom to do as they please throughout the city inbetween completing missions given to you by various characters. GTA 5 is an absolute spectacle, this is the first modern game that has impressed me technologically wise, it looks great and plays great, the world feels alive and the audio is done incredibly well. It is also really well optimized, my pc is fairly old and I get stable framerates on ultra settings.\n\nGTA 5 offers an incredibly strong narrative, brilliant characters that are voiced amazingly well and a story which is similar to that of an over the top, large budget action film, the gameplay hasn't changed much at all besides for being able to switch between characters on the fly which makes for some pretty interesting gun fights later in the game. In GTA 5 there is an awesome selection of weapons to use which are also modifiable allowing you to add attachments such as silencers, better scopes, flashlights and upgrading the magazine capacity and accuracy.\n\nStaying true to the series, GTA V is pretty much a satire of modern America which involves stereotypes and pointing fun at different organizations and people, people who get offended easily may not appreciate the humour this game offers as it is pretty remorseless.\n\nThe multiplayer is great fun, along with TDM, Races etc you're able to carry out missions with other players such as heists. They're not too challenging but pretty fun when you have a team of people who know what they're doing.\n\nWhile GTA V is generally a good game, I don't think I've ever played a game as easy as it, there is absolutely no challenge at all in the campaign, none, and any difficulty this game could've had is taken away by constant checkpoints through missions, super powers your characters possess such as being able to slow down time and your life regenerating to a point. I also didn't like the way the missions played out, they're pretty much on rails, unlike GTA 3 and Vice City which allowed you to complete lots of missions in anyway you pleased, this just has some cutscene of your character clumsily walking into a combat sequence then you having to take out all the enemies, steal the car etc instead of being able to use the games massive world and approach the combat situations how you please, that was a massive part of what made the earlier installments of the series really fun.\n\nOverall this is an okay game which could've been a whole lot better had they focussed less on cinematics and scripted events and put more effort into making clever mission design and not adding in a few mechanics which make this extremely easy ride even easier. I can't recommend this, as polished as the game is and how brilliant the writing is the missions are inexcusably easy and offer no freedom, while a much better game than GTA 4 this still comes no where near the original games.","April 29, 2015","false","87.8"," 52 of 93 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","52","93","5","21"

This is why\n\nRockstar is a ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥\nRockstar changed price to 74.98 right before steam summer sale so they can sell it for the same price\n\nDelayed gameplay\nWhen I press "w" to walk it takes about 5 seconds before my character actually starts walking, the same with all the other controls, in the car when I press "w" to accelerate the car just stands there for about 10 seconds then it starts to drive when I release "w" the car continues for about 10 seconds, sometimes when I press "s" to reverse in a car, the car starts doing donuts, I checked all my settings there is nothing wrong with the setting, the game is severely flawed\n\nDownload\nI wasted several days on downloading this game to get the biggest disappointment in my whole life, I was heart broken when I discovered really how bad this game was\n\nSensitivity\nI know you can change the sensitivity, I know, but in the menus I can't change the senitivity, I change the sensitivity to lowest but the mouse is still ♥♥♥♥ing speedy gonzales, ridiculous! Then when I get back into the game the sensitivity is literaly the offspring of a turtle and a ♥♥♥♥ing tortoise\n\nPlayers\nOk yes, yes, this is not Rockstar's fault, but I almost always in games with complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I might just be unlucky, I have no idea\n\nPretty much what ruins this game the most is the sensitivity and unresponsive/delayed controls\n\nI would rate this game 0/100 59.99 euros down the ♥♥♥♥ing drain and 3 days of downloading wasted","June 19, 2015","false","337.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Well it is, if you can actually make it into a server without the game putting you in singleplayer for no reason... My favourite is when you connect to a server but the Rockstar cloud services screw up and you can't save any progress :^( What's the point of waiting for those incredibly long loading screens for something that is just stuffed?...\n\nYou run out of stuff to do eventually Heists become a chore or (mostly) unplayable if you don't have friends there, races and stuff are always won by sweaty plebs that do nothing but learn each race track all day and to top it all off, hackers can hack with ease and with little indication of slowing down...\nYes, they remove your guns, can't be killed, spawn NPCs and other objects and also have the ability to blow up everyone on the server at once, thus making the freeroam experience broken as hell.\n\nDO NOT buy this game until a price drop even if bonus GTA online cash is offered... You can always buy cash cards later (or better yet just play the game...)\n\n\nThe fact that we waited for a PC release this long and the game has just been broken after a recent patch (not the first time) is sad...\n\nI hardly play this game anymore...","July 12, 2015","false","171.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowAngel/recommended/271590/","ShadowAngel","ShadowAngel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowAngel/","753 products in account","Now this is going to be a difficult kind of Review since it's basically two games in one: GTA V and GTA Online.\nGTA V is despite it's number the 12th game of the series, i played them all except Chinatown Wars and the GBC Version of GTA 1, i follow the series since it was first released in late 1997 and that makes it a bit difficult to truly give a thumbs up for the single player because GTA V is, to put it bluntly, the same old ♥♥♥♥, actually the same old ♥♥♥♥ if you also take in the other games that formula into account: Bully and Red Dead Redemption, which in itself are awesome games (RDR was one of two reasons for me to get an Xbox360 and i bought Bully twice on the PS2 in it's original version back then as well as the PC version) but if you follow the games you will see that they follow the same formula: Cops and law enforcers are corrupt and will ♥♥♥♥ you over, never trust anybody because you always meet somebody who turns from friend to foe, missions always the same "go there, kill him" formula and you might think after nearly 20 years Rockstar, whatever studio it is might try to do spice things up. In GTA V's case the spicing is the Heists that evolved from GTA IV's Three Leaf Clover mission into full "We plan, you have two ways of doing it, choose your crew and let's roll"-Heists that even put contemporary criminal games like Payday 2 or The Masterplan to shame in it's depth and thanks to the fact that now you not only play one character but three: Meet Franklin, Michael and Trevor who represent a "Best of Rockstar Guys" set: Franklin is like CJ from GTA: San Andreas, the same token ghetto black guy who was a criminal, tried to get away from that life just to be sucked back into it. Michael is a lot like Tommy Vercetti without the Prison stint, a well known gangster who robbed stuff but sold out to the feds and lives in witness protection otherwise he is like Vercetti the moment he goes back into the life of crime. Trevor is a maniac who combines all the bad guys of Rockstar history, yet is still presented in a positive light (otherwise evrybody would refuse to play as him)\nYou would think now that 3 characters would open a whole new dimension for GTA like being able to choose one of 3 or have the missions where everybody is involved to go down different paths. That is sadly not the case. You have unique side quests for every character which are fun but in the main story quests you will be forced to play one specific character with no other choice or you're sem-forced to switch to characters to survive the missions. To give examples without much of spoilers, one of the more non-story sidequests involve Franklink driving a sports car and challenge two other guys for an illegal street race. Trevor and Michael pose as Cops on Bike to take the two drivers down. It would've been interesting to play Michael or Trevor as cops chasing the high speed drivers down but instead you're forced to play as Franklin and only as hin, driving in an underpowered car. Another example is one of the Heists where you're constantly forced to switch between characters to keep them alive and take down scripted targets.\nWhile this all is still the gameplay you expect from Rockstar, you would think that after such a long time it would evolve and give the player more freedom.\nAlso of note for the single player is that basically none of the online dlcs are released for it.\n\nWhich lead me to GTA Online. While i played throug the story mode already in the Xbox360 release of GTA V i couldn't be bothered to pay a monthly fee to play online, so i only started on the PC with the online mode and as my play time shows, i wasted a ton of hours into it. You create your own character, you start with some petty crimes after a small tutorial, you rob a liquo store, you kill some npcs and get their money to get into bigger things. The bigger things got delivered by Rockstar via free DLC. From contact missions which play like your usual GTA style missions to the Heists that are even more advanced than the single player heists to Races (with or without weapons, in different car classes and thanks to custom options, where players can create their own races with freedom, even stunt races with ramps and loopings) and various co-op (Survial) and PvP/Teambased/Handicap Events there is a lot to experience with strangers or friends. Speaking of strangers or friends, you can join Crews or create a crew with your friends including designing a logo and defining crew colors.\nAnother big aspect and probably also the most critisized one are the cars. There are tons of cars (around 200 i would guess) Cars available, everything from the 1920's Gangster Car to the modern windtunnel-designed super car in various classes. You can tune most, you can enhance 11 more into lowriders (+ 1 into a donk now) with a lot of designs and elements to choose from but it will cost you a ridiculous sum which is the big critic point in GTA Online: Everything is overpriced. Clothes and Accessoirces can range into 5 digits easily, Lowriders cost over 1 million dollars. Apartments range from 200.000 to over 1 million and Yachts, Helicopters, Airplanes and Boats cost several millions of dollars. Grinding money takes a long time even w ith heists so the game has microtransactions in the form of Shark Cards but it has to be said that none of the vehicles are truly needed to have fun and even a 200.000 apartment enables you to start Heists. So it's not as evil as most other reviews make it sound like. Have some patience and see those expensive vehicles and apartments or the yacht as long-term goal.\nThe big warning of course is that Online is filled with Cheaters and Griefers who either kill you or drop money on you in hopes Rockstar bans you. In the few times i went into public lobbies i got blown up, had cars spawned in my apartment, had stuff spawned around me or otherwise experienced nasty things (i have screenshots of some of those experiences in my gallery here) but you can always go into a prive/invite lobby and enjoy the game there with no cheater ♥♥♥♥ing you over so i don't count it as a negative, after all, all online games have cheaters and other lowlife scum too.\n\nComing to the technical stuff: Gameplay is the same as every Rockstar game. I'm kinda baffled that Helicopters and Planes still control as bad as they did in GTA San Andreas over 10 years ago. Cars got improved a lot over how they controlled in GTA IV where they floated around and crashing into walls was the norm.\nGraphics got improved a lot too over GTA IV. Los Santo is a lot more colorful than Liberty City that consisted of brown and grey.\nAudio is the same high standard you expect from Rockstar: Great voice actors, even some famous people mostly on the radio station and everybody gave their best. The Music always played a big role and plays a big role again with several songs being integrated in the cutscenes of the single player mode and the usual varied radio stations. PC also has the nice advantage of allowing you to use your own music (i would recommend anything but the Radio mode because you will hear the same "your taste sucks", "this song made me nearly kill myself", "you pirated the songs fom the internet" comments over and over and they aren't even funny the firs time around)\n\nSo yes GTA V Single Player is disappointing if you played the previous GTA or other Rockstar games because it's just the same old stuff . New playes though certainly will enjoy it because it might be the best GTA (Vice City is my personal favourite but even i have to admit that after nearly 14 yeras it shows it's age) and GTA Online is a ton of fun if you have a couple friends on board to play it with you.","March 16","true","712.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"
