No other compensation was given.\n\nIntroduction\n==========\nChronicon is about a special magical device...a device that creates a link to the memories of the long-forgotten heroes of yore. A link that allows anyone who ventures forth to relive the past lives of those fallen heroes. You are chosen as one of the few this time...and being chosen is a great honor. What will you do now?\n\nChronicon is an action-adventure RPG, set in a (so far) small, Early Access world. Yes, Chronicon is in Early Access, but if you look past that tag, you might see the potential Chronicon has. Let's take a peek at what it has in store for you.\n\nGameplay\n==========\nSo you've installed Chronicon and hit Play Game. You are greeted with a selection of 4 unique heroes: Templar, Berserker, Warden, and Warlock. Each one has a very distinct playstyle. The Templar and Berserker are melee characters, the difference being the Templar is defensive and the Berkserker is offensive. The Warden and Warlock are ranged, with their difference being physical offense (bow/arrows) and magical offense. Choose whichever playstyle suits you the best!\n\nEach character has a small 'tree' of skills they can learn and assign to be used on the fly. You can access a new tier of skills every 5 levels. As you level up by killing monsters you gain skill points (1 per level), and you can invest these points into the skills of your choosing. The more points you invest into a particular skill, the more powerful or effective it becomes. Each character has unique skills and passives that can be learned, some offering great benefits, others offering new spells and actions.\n\nAt it's core, Chronicon is a dungeon crawler, similar to titles such as Diablo, Torchlight, or Titan's Quest. You explore a locale, kill monsters, collect loot, and level up. There are even some features in Chronicon that you may recall seeing in these other titles, such as the Portal Scroll which gives you a ticket back to the hub to sell your loot. There are also Waypoints, which you can use to traveI back and forth between predetermined points in each area. Speaking of areas, in the hub there are 5 Teleport Orbs, each one representing a dungeon/location. Only the Fallen Temple (first orb) is currently available, and during my 7-8 hours of play none of the other orbs were made available. The Store Page says these additional levels are coming in future updates. I played Chronicon with a controller, and the combat reminded me of a twin stick shooter. You move your character with the left stick, and aim your attacks with the right stick. It works, to be sure, but it was a little awkward for me at first to see this kind of control scheme in a game of this particular genre.\n\nThere are a lot of breakable objects, such as pots, urns, and baskets. These can be great for finding hidden loot and crystals (currency) but I felt like they served to padden the game a little bit. There are literally TONS of breakable objects in each stage, but only small groups of enemies scattered through each stage. I would much rather have mowed through hordes of enemies than break a room full of pots. This might be attributed to the fact that the game is still in Early Access, so I was able to look past it. When you did find monsters, it was fun to mow them down however you could, occasionally enjoying a slightly more prolonged encounter with a 'champion' monster. These are quite a bit more powerful than the normal monsters, and drop significantly more loot. Also spread throughout are small shrines, which take the form of statues. When activated, they may give you a buff or heal you, but they can also rarely spawn powerful creatures to attack you.\n\nCertain loot can only be used by certain classes, and a lot of loot has its own special qualities. An item of one type can be very different than another item of the same type, depending on the quality. Try to stay outfitted with the best gear possible for the best chance of survival!\n\nGraphics\n==========\nChronicon has a very distinct sprite-base design. They aren't what I'd call 'basic', but they aren't too terribly detailed either. Don't get me wrong, they look great for sprites, and animations are crisp, clear, and flow smoothly. But don't expect anything special as you play.\n\nThe Fallen Temple looked really good...very dark and creepy, as something 'fallen' should be! The monsters fit the theme of the area...ghouls, skeletons, and ghosts running around everywhere. Even some bats thrown in for good measure. All of these have the same quality as the character sprites, and are animated pretty well.\n\nSound and Music\n==========\nThis is easily the game's biggest downside. There is very little in the way of music or sound effects. The Fallen Temple has a low, somber tune that plays, but that's about it. Your attacks, breaking pots and urns, and hitting enemies have sound effects. But nothing else does. If it did, I hardly noticed. I also attribute this to the game being Early Access, so I was able to overlook it. Understanding that this is a very early Alpha build means that not all assets are implemented yet, and I'm sure they will be in the future!\n\nPerformance\n==========\nChronicon ran without any hitches on my medium-tier rig. It should pose no issues to most players. It's not a very intense game, and I don't expect many people to run into any performance issues. Does your kitchen have a toaster? It can probably run Chronicon.\n\nI played entirely with a controller, so I can confirm that it indeed has full controller support. The controls were very easy for me to use, even with the twin stick configuration combat has.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n==========\nAt the end of the day, Chronicon is a decent entry into the action-adventure RPG genre. It's by no means the best, but it's not terrible. It's worth checking out and at least keeping an eye on as it develops further. With a handful of playable classes, lots of loot to collect, and small hordes of enemies to mow down, you should have a great time exploring the memories of past heroes. Future updates plan to include crafting, more quests, more items, a hardcore mode, and the 4 additional chapters currently missing from the hub. If you want to help this game out and see it suceed, please, by all means give it a purchase to support the devs! This is what Early Access is all about.\n\nGameplay Demo\n==========\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuQ2o68_PDM\n\nNerd House Verdict:\n==========\nRecommended\n\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","July 31, 2015","true","7.6"," 43 of 47 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","43","47","0","2"

So much loot. So much fun.\n\nSeriously, this game is a blast. A Stone. Cold. Blast. I got it for the positive reviews, thought I'd pop in for ten minutes (like I do with most newly purchased games) and then move onto my usual game of the day. Well, over two hours later, I came up for air in something of a state of bliss.\n\nThis game gives the carrot and stick perfectly. It's like Diablo 3 in that regard. One more dungeon for that one more piece of loot that'll give you better stats. There's so much loot its insane. The review that said to learn not to pick up everything ain't kidding. Slots are very limited, so you really have to curate what you want.\n\nI've only planed one class, but I can't wait to play more. I mean four classes each with four skill trees? That's pretty awesome. So far, I'm just having a blast, and if you like fast-paced, loot-filled dungeon crawlers, you will too.","March 25","true","4.7"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

You can play up to four players local (no online), which really spices things up with a game like this. I was never too keen on Diablo, but this I can get into - especially with a friend or two.\n\nIf you are not familiar with the Diablo series or type of gameplay, it basically consists of action-based hack-n-slash dungeon crawling to 1) gain experience, and 2) pick up loot, which is hopefully better than what you have. Then you return to a main hub or town to manage your stuff and level up. Rinse and repeat. Its a simple formula, but can be quite addictive and really offer tons of replayability, especially considering different hero classes.\n\nPros:\n+Graphics are nice\n+Up to four players local\n+Full controller support\n+Totally cheap for the amount of replayability\n+Lots of great in-game options for things like map placement/opacity, text size, lighting options, and tons more - I really appreciate this for a game that you can play from the couch with four people (in the past, there are a few games that would have been totally great if it weren't for limited options like this)\n\nMeh:\n=Music is decent so far\n\nCons:\n-We need to get more people following this game - the community is super small\n-Its not done yet - which is almost never a 'Con' for me, but its one guy and I just really hope this title gets finished to the point of the original vision.\n\nYeah, if you like Diablo and you like indie games - this is totally worth full price, IMO.","December 18, 2015","true","4.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","15","18","5","9"

Chronicon just gets things it so right.\n\nThe current video (Updte 0.40.0) really does well to show what this game is capable of and how you can take your champ/build too amazing heights.\n\nThe upcoming changes in update 0.50.0 just make this game even more worth while, with even more gear slots/options and in turn more ability to play with getting your stats setup just right.\n\nSure the skill tree is no where near as complex as PoE and the visuals are not as nice as D3, but so far this game is an epic 10/10 and shines bright alongside much bigger titles, and there is still more to come from a really friendly and active Developer. I cant wait to see how this game progresses while it moves through early access and onto full release.\n\nI onlyhave two gripes about the game so far:\n- Can't move and attack at the same time (This may be a good thing)\n- Very limited multiplayer\n\nTLDR: Really fun loot filled RPG, worth far more than it costs. 10/10.","March 18","true","4.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAnimaal/recommended/375480/","MrAnimaal","MrAnimaal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAnimaal/","406 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nChronicon is a adventure, indie RPG game that, places you in a interesting storyline while travelling into the souls and memories of fallen heroes in big maps, with a "diablo 1" feeling in the stomech.\n\nAs for the characters goes, we have 4 different champions to pick. Templar, Beserker, Warden and Warlock. Each class has it own skill set of 5 different attacks/speels for each 3 lanes. The lanes are Passive, death and fire. All characters has ranged, defence and offensive abilitys to use. The lvl's goes to lvl 30+, where you will be able to upgrade each ability within the 1 - 5- 10 - 20 - 30 lvl stages as there is.\n\nWhen it comes to loot, every loot is decided for each class. Which means, that you cannot wear a Warlock hat etc. on the maps will there be placed traps, chest and different monsters within quests. Quests are the storyline you do on the run, and where you have to intereact with objects. You will have different stats and a inventory to keep your looted items to sell. The shop has a decent pricetag on the equitment, which lead us to more usage of the store than focus on loot. Scrolls allows you to teleport between town and the instance you are in. - Note - If you use a scroll, it stays there till you get back from the town.\n\nOverall game and performance, then everything ran smoothly without issues or typical crashes. A great EA release, which is interesting. Under my preview i had a diablo 1 feeling with the mixture of music and in-game experience. I like the storyline which gives you a feeling that you want to explorer and know the rest of the dead memories of fallen heroes.\n\nIf you are searching for a Diablo 1 feeling, with a relaxing and challenging game with many difficulties to fight you through, then this game is for you.\n\nHere is a demo: http://www.twitch.tv/theearlyaccess/v/8840171","July 28, 2015","true","1.8"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/timba3olf/recommended/375480/","timba3olf","Timba3olf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/timba3olf/","165 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA fun action rpg of the Diablo/Torchlight variety with nostalgic graphics, random dungeons, lots of loot, and 4 distinct classes. Slightly clunky, but very well-developed for an early access title.\n\nFor maximum enjoyment: use a controller, turn up the ambient light in the settings, find a big screen, and invite three friends with three more controllers.\n\nEdit: Having now played Chronicon for over 60 hours and reached level cap, I thought it worthwhile to expand this review.\n\nChronicon is easily one of the best Early Access titles I've played. The game is well balanced, the classes are already fleshed-out (with 4 skills trees each and plenty of legendaries to enhance each tree), and the level design is random enough that there's always an element of uncertainty (although the very small maps tend to just juggle around enemy variety and placement). The game has pretty solid controller support for both XBox 360 and Steam Controller; I mostly play with the latter.\n\nThe local co-op is one of Chronicon's strongest features. I've played a few hours with my brother and my girlfriend and it's a really enjoyable and straighforward experience. Just plug in another controller and go. Be prepared to spend a fair bit of downtown sorting through loot, though.\n\nThe updates have been very regular and significant so far. I worry about the amount of sleep the dev is getting. Bug fixes come very quickly and I haven't yet encountered a bug that ruined the game or cost me significant progress.\n\nThe plot isn't particularly rivetting, but I've never played an ARPG with an even remotely engaging plot, so this doesn't bother me. We're all here to kill monsters, after all, not read walls of text. And Chronicon's monster-slaying is highly satisfying. This is a game where you butcher hundreds of enemies in one go. The game includes a killstreak mechanic similar to D3's, except in Chronicon you'll quickly find yourself bringing in killstreaks that break 100. On higher levels, you'll find yourself getting closer to 1000.\n\nI highly recommend Chronicon, especially if you're a fan of loot-heavy, dungeon crawling action rpgs but miss the controller support of older console titles like Dark Alliance and Champions of Norrath.","December 19, 2015","true","93.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

It's well made, with very good gameplay mechanics and surprisingly a lot to do. There isn't as much content as I would like, as of writing this review there is currently only 1 act available. However, don't let that fool you as there is a lot of content packed into the act, plus there are something like 5 different difficulties to choose from (though they dont really change things much).\n\nThe maps are giant, to do a full clear of a map will likely take at least an hour if not more to complete. There are tons of enemies and various enemy modifiers that can make enemies different, like speed modifiers and element modifiers. There are secret rooms packed with treasures, there are tons of items to find, with lots of various stats. There are currently 4 classes (a paladin (template), warrior (beserker), hunter (warden), mage (warlock)). Each class has 3 skill paths, 2 paths for active skills and 1 path for passive skills. Each class can have a total of 3 active skills at once, with the ability to reset your skills from a potion within town. Each skill can be upgraded a total of 10 times. There are pets and minions as well.\n\nAs it stands the game is really good, I can't wait for more content and updates. Something else worth noting is that the developer is very involved, posting and helping in the forums to every question asked so far. I really hope the game succeeds as i would love to see this game fully developed.","August 3, 2015","true","24.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The art style while definitely unique, it kinda feels a bit too simplistic for my taste but that doesn't take away from the fun. There's 3 Acts completed by the time of this review and the developer updates quite frequently with content and general fixes, there's 2 more acts in the works from what it seems which is quite exciting!\n\nThe combat might feel stiff at times but there's nothing too serious to hinder the player. There's lots of dungeons to explore, quests and optional quests, a quite decent story to unravel and the gear system is top notch. Legendaries, sets, you name it. There are several classes to choose from, each one with own specific talent tree and an important note is that you can actually change your talents at your leisure for dirt cheap.\n\nThere's some endgame content in the form of Anomalies (think of Diablo III rifts) and quite a few secrets within the main campaign.\n\nOverall this is a very promising game, sort of like a diamond in the rough, quite worth its price compared to the hours of content provided, and there's replayability with playing different classes and doing anomalies. The game also supports local co-op however I did not had the chance to give it a go.\n\nRecommended for experienced ARPG fans and even more so for those who might be new to genre.","May 29","true","21.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It´s a Hacknslash ARGP with tons of loot and randomization.\nAct 3 is being worked on & A4 + A5 are coming. Even in this early state the game is amazingly fun.\nFour classes might sound little but each has 4 different build trees, There are 100 levels available and more classes will eventually get released once the game goes live.\nThis is the story of how a 1-person indie developer can do better games than multimillion dollar companies. It´s David vs. Goliath and it´s all about passion. The itemzation alone is better than anything I’ve seen since D2. Yes, it´s not that pretty and yes it is old school 8-bit graphics - if Virtual Eye Candy is a must look elsewhere. For those who can accept lesser graphics for better game quality think Gauntlet meets Diablo 2 and immensely addictive.\nEven the pricing is ridiculously low. 10 bucks? I threw more than double the price amount on donations alone just to get this going.\n\n\nCons\nThe build trees themselves could use more diversity\nNo online play\n8 bit graphics\nNeeds more advertisement (WAKE UP Total Biscuit, Angry Joe, ReformistTM, Quill18 and all the others)\n\nPros\nOld school ARGP at its finest\nThe developer clearly shows a lot of passion and it easy to get smitten\nKeyboard or gamepad - your choice\nUp to 4 Players on one machine with gamepads\nRandom maps\nQuests\n100 Class and skill point levels\nFive difficulties (you choose difficulty each new session)\nNo-return portals with random zone affixes\nCheap Skill-reset potions\nLegendary loot can drop from the get go\nShrines that yield buffs\nRiddles yielding extra loot when solved\n10 bucks\nTons of customization in the options menu\n10 bucks\n4 Trees with overlapping mechanics for each class\n10 bucks\nChampions & Bosses with random affixes\nDid I mention it only costs 10 bucks?","April 25","true","99.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The random enemy buffs can prove to be more than a challenge if the right one are selected and items can give you a sense of pride after getting. When I started the game, I immeditaly went after the hardest difficulty becuase I'm a couragous (a.k.a. idiotic) player. I would recommend that you start the game at a lower difficulty however, as the progress can become extremely slowed down if you are not prepared for the challenge.\nI will say however, for the leveling system and it's skills, they all seem a bit lack-luster. Mind you, if you use combos well enough you can hold a pretty good fight, but none of them for me really jumped out and said "use me a lot!". When I look for a game like this, I want chaos and power to be flung around like hotcakes on sale. But that is just me.

Innovative and simple to use, fitting multiple menus together in a way I have never seen before.\n\n+ Simple level design, and it randomly generates each time you re-enter a room\n\n+ Chronicon follows the Diablo II formula to a T.

If you're into Indie games and the fresh perspective they bring, you'll like what you see. If you enjoy refreshingly lo-fi graphics that invoke the feeling of nostalgia, then you'll need to look no further. If seek an experience that constantly beckons you back for more, you'll be hooked. If you like loot, and lots of it, you'll have more than you need. If you find yourself attracted to Mobs, you'll be in good company. If you need a new RPG to scratch that fantasy itch, you'll find relief here. If you dig games that don't take themselves too seriously, the gameplay will put you at ease. Lastly, if you want mechanics that don't get in the way of fun, Chronicon will deliver it.\n\nSo yeah, give it a try. The price is right and if you hit on more than one item I touched on above, you surely won't regret it!","June 4","true","7.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Its very unbalanced and slow. It takes forever to kill enemies and boils down to buying health and mana potions so you can run it and spam abilities, since there is no cooldown. There are a lot of abilities but only four slots to use them, and as far as i know there is no way to reallocate your skills, which is necessary because the earlier skills will be useless. Its basically hero siege with a little bit of diablo. It is early access so maybe these things will be changed, but as of right now, its not fun.\n\nUPDATE: Even though the game is still not that fun, im changing my review to postive because its gonna be good, i can smell it.","July 30, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Many enemies on the screen, blood and LOOT! So much LOOT! This game is very addictive, attractive and nifty. The environment music is dark, obscure and holds you. Combat system is fluid and easy to manage. The skill tree is very well made and gives you many possibilities to make your build in the way you want. I bought yesterday this early access game and I know for experience that this game is awesome. It seems the devs are very responsive and always has updates for the game. I totally recommend Chronicon. I hope in a near future a multiplayer lan game. I give 9/10.\n\nUpdate after 13h game\n\nI swear that I never played a game so rewarding before like this one. Every elite enemy or a badass boss always drop a high value item. You constantly changes your equipment on a higher level new one and because of this you'll never be tired of your current equipment set. I strongly recommend to play this game on a higher difficult....you won't regret it ;). Search every corner for a chest and enter in every portal to another dimension when appear it. It is very, VERY rewarding. After more than 13h of game I'm still in the 1st chapter. This game is absolutely HUGE. The skills after you leveling up becomes more and more awesome, you know that you are getting stronger.

Finding new items felt good.. But one of the biggest draws to this genre for me personally is the cosmetic side of things. Take Diablo 3 for example, being able to equip different gear and have it visibily change the look of my character is great! Plus they added transmog in which made it even better. I was disappointed to see that in Chronicon as soon as i started equipping things my character didnt change at all. Im fine with gender locked/base type characters in games like this, but having zero gear customization at all really kills any fun I had with it. I refunded the game for now, but hope maybe they are planning to add more customization once they have the core fundamentals of the game nailed down first. If not, its a pass as there are much better games in the same genre that have everything it offers plus more.","April 28","false","0.6"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

I sort of like it, I sort of don't.\nGreat for mindless dungeon-crawling with your friends in local co-op although slow, and it very much lacks variety. Most of the skills are rather basic in design and you shouldn't expect it to come close to other Diablo-likes on here such as Torchlight 2 or Grim Dawn. It's got potential to be something much more, as it is in early access, but I think a lot of the skills would need to be altered or changed completely for it to really shine.

However, I give it my recommendation because of this, and in spite of it's various flaws.\n\nThe skill system could use some work. A lot of it is cookie-cutter. Main Skill + Mana Reducing effect. I am not exageratting when I say every class follows this path, so the early hours of the game are mainly spamming a single skill. And why do I need to dump 10 skill points into that skill for it be usable? I should be spending those points on getting new abilities which will vary the game play.\n\nThe combat, outside of character building, is simple, but satisfying. Screen shakes, enemies explode all over the place, kill chains keep you moving (would love the timer bar from D3 in there!). That's all good stuff.\n\nThe itemization is also fairly solid, with some neat items to find, and while nothing mind blowing or game changing, there is a certain level of character customization to be found in what gear you decide to wear. Healing vs. Damage vs. Utility.\n\nI give it a tentative recommendation. I will probably keep an eye out and keep playing, but hopefully over time, the skill system could get a closer look to enable more varied combat between classes and skill trees.\n\nThere is some stiff competition in terms of ARPGs these days, and even a tiny indie project must consider that, because you're fighting for that time. I would like to see this game do things a little differently, offer something fresh, as opposed to the same things found in AAA ARPGs, but at a smaller and pixelated scale.\n\n6/10 Not terrible.","January 11","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All classes are viable, feel different to play, and most importantly, are fun to play.  I honestly didn't pay too much attention to the story, so I cant comment on the quality of it, but all you need to know is that there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't like you, and you don't like it.\n\nThe dev cares deeply about the game, constantly takes feedback from the community, actually puts that feedback into the game, and he updates often.\n\nSo, if you liked any of the diablos, torchlights, victor vran, starcraft/dota adventure customs, hero siege, MU online, or any other awesome loot-grindy, hacky-slashy, pew pew, check-out-my-sweet-new-build, games, then seriously, buy this one, too.","June 6","true","21.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
