One must buy a dlc to unlock 2 of the major races that were originally in II. I followed the emails and other updates during development, and also participated in the beta, and I feel that GCIII is more of a cash cow than anything else. There was a ship designer in GCII; they emphasized that it would be improved in III before release, but it is almost identical to that of GCII.\n\nThis game is worth $40 only if they gave you all the dlc; buy it on sale, or from a cdkey site for a discount. Otherwise, enjoy GCII which feels more realistic and balanced in terms of AI behavior. It's amazing how they can make $50 of dlc for a $40 dollar update of GCII.\n\nI leave with this: is it fun? Yes. Is it more fun than GCII? Not really. If you enjoy masochistically having your wallet ransacked, this is your opportunity. I have liked Stardock in the past, especially with Sins of a Solar Empire, among other games. They, unfortunately, now resemble EA or Activision.","April 25","false","57.1"," 423 of 483 people (88%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","88","423","483","20","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006986278/recommended/226860/","76561198006986278","Bored Peon","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006986278/","78 products in account","I can not currently recommend this game for the full $50 price. Maybe later when the price drops or some patches come out to fix some things.\n\nThere is just some real irritating flaws in the game that when combined with the other problems drop the game down the the blah level. Most could be fixed easily. Two and five probably will never change which is what will keep this game not much above the blah level.\n\n1. Capitals on a planet, The AI places them at random wherever it wants. Considering capitals give bonuses to surrounding buildings it makes a big difference on where it was placed. It seems to me that if I find an unsettled planet I should be able to choose the location of the capital. So because the AI chose a dumb spot for a capital you lose those bonuses because they go to waste. The best example would be if hexes were about the size of Australia and you were to colonize a planet with land masses like Earth, why would you place your capital in Australia and forfeit all bonuses?\n\n2. No retreat option for combat. Similar games (Master of Orion and Endless Space) at least gave you the option to retreat during combat, meaning you could take some damage and/or losses but at least have a chance to run away. So later in game if the enemy is bigger and faster then you do not stand a chance of getting away. At that point you might as well concede the game. Simply because a fleet can attack as many times as it has movement points.\n\n3. You can draw production in a shipyard from multiple planets over long distances to build colony ships, but somehow people just can not make that same trip. Yet these same people are going to climb into that ship you just built and travel ten times that same distance. So now you have to waste multiple turns just putting people into your colony ship.\n\n4. Technology specialization. What was the point in this feature? The specialization technologies can traded and you can find the specialized in anomalies. Which if you receive a tech you have no made a choice, you lose that choice. So if you wanted to specialize in a certain bonus, but a friendly AI gives you a different specialization tech, then maybe next game, unless you get lucky and find another AI to trade for it. The fact that you lose your choice of specialization is extremely lame. Never mind how it can get exploited in multiplayer.\n\n5. Battles are either "quick result" or "watch battle" meaning you have zero control on that battle. All of the battle tactics are based on what job tags you gave the ships in your fleet. Which means no singling out a target to kill first. The battles for the most part are not worth watching anyways because either option is going to give you the same outcome.\n\n6. Construction ships and using the station option to call for one. Someone had a great idea to be able to have a space station go "Hey I need a construction drone to build another module" and you click that button. Then a construction drone will be built and sent to that station. Sounds cool right? Real cool up to the point that this feature will clear any orders an existing drone currently has. So if you manually sent a drone to build a new station, it wont reach it. So that means you have to wait to use this feature until your manual drone is done. This feature will clear orders a drone already has, but will not clear guard or sentry, so makign them in advance and planning on using this feature does not work.\n\n7. Excess research and production is lost. When the game calculates the end of a turn if it finishes building or researching something any points over that mark are NOT carried to the next project, the points are just gone. This just seems to make the game drag on and it also makes specialized manufacturing planets nearly pointless because so much can go to waste.\n\n8. Ship designer spamming designs. Whenever you get new technologies the ship designer will spit out new ships designs, which later in the game leads to having way too many designs to sort through. Stardock solved this in previous versions and other games by adding a feature able to turn off the auto-designer. Considering that feature exists in multiple other Stardock games the feature should exist here.\n\n9. Cultural expansion is ridiculous. It expands faster than you can explore early on. If you never explored it then how is your culture affecting it? About equal to the Roman Empire holding cultural sway over North America before they even knew it existed. The only way to catch up later is you disposable scouts with stacks of engines, lifesupport, and scanners which is about mid game. Since I have only played insane maps, then smaller maps probably run a higher chance of culture flipping.\n\n10. Rush production is really flawed. If you rush a production in queue then no other production points are gained from that planet or shipyard for that turn. On top of that rushing production is a set amount, even if you have the production item almost complete.\n\n11. The pirates are pointless. Four hundred turns in on a insane map size and I am discovering the same low tech pirates that were encounted in the first dozen turns. This makes them nothing but a nuisance, one that apparently the AI ignores. Not even sure if they attack the AI or not because the pirates will not attack anything stronger than them. So basically then end up as nothing but clutter to make your end turn processing longer.\n\nThese are the just the basic things I can think of that should have been ironed out during the beta.\n\nNow for the technical aspects.\n\n1. The sound for cut scene movies. Apparently someone forgot to include cut scene movie volume with the sound options in the game. So it just comes out as a bunch of mumbling.\n\n2. End of turn processing on large map. This is really what kills the gaming mood. I made it up to around 400 turns on an insane map before it was just too ridiculous to play. The time to process became about 2-3 minutes a turn, which really sucks if the only thing you do on your turn is spend a few seconds to click next turn.\nThe other issue is every time the end turn process it kicks in all the fans in my computer into overdrive just to keep up with the processing. Meanwhile you can not touch much with getting the "not responding error" from Windows. Which by the way if you are seeing that blue circle between turns, it aint a Stardock logo thing, that is Windows saying "hey this program aint responding." Which leads me to wonder if running the game is really good for the computer.\n\n3. Ship designer, great feature (seriously.) One tip though, you might want to save your game before using it. Otherwise you could be sent back to your last autosave it decides to crash.\n\n4.  I received the achievement for the completing the first part of the campaign game simply by clicking to start it. Sounds petty and nitpicking, but think about it for a moment. That is really sloppy coding and testing. Where else in making the game were they sloppy? I think the first patch today fixed this along with a dozen other achievements, which basically proved my point.\n\n5. After about 200 turns the text on the UI starts disappearing. Which is really annoying with diplomacy options.\n\nI was one of those customers burned years ago by Stardock with Elemental: War of Magic. This release reeks of the same issues. The whole "release it and patch it later" attitude. About the same effect as buying an early access game when they are on the .8x builds.\n\nSo in short, if you are on the fence on buying this, let me knock you off it. Wait and watch, in the mean time take a browse through the forums. Sure in six months of patch it might be a decent game, but news flash I doubt it will still be $50 price tag on it.\n\nIf you are mainly thinking about the game mainly because of the ship editor then do yourself a favor and go find a free 3d animation program like Blender and learn something in the process.","May 15, 2015","false","55.5"," 1,047 of 1,270 people (82%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","82","047","1","35","44"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serialies/recommended/226860/","serialies","Serialies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serialies/","161 products in account","General features (can be viewed as pros):\n\n-Race customization is fairly detailed\n-Ship designer is good, even better because you can use pre-existing models and modify them to your own tastes\n-Certain resources are linked to certain celestial bodies eg antimatter surround black holes, elerium in nebulae, etc. So a savvy player, upon seeing a nebula knows to explore it fully incase there is elerium and that a black hole is likely to have some antimatter surrounding it.\n-powerful resources like antimatter are more limited, but using them is non-destructive so there wont be buyers remorse, ie you'll get the resource back if you destroy the building/ship that uses it. This also allows you to use resources early in buildings tech, and then recycle it when a better option arrives, meaning that a player who can manage his resources well will do better than one who just holds onto resources until a "top tier" usage for them is unlocked.\n-massive maps are possible, so with the right settings it doesnt feel like a "small" galaxy or that you're running out of space (until late game)\n-starbases used intelligently can give an edge at all points in the game, especially economic starbases. eg rather than waste a building slot on your planet to raise approval, just get the approval upgrade on the starbase linked to the planet.\n-able to finely control research/economy output/dedication on planets individually, but also with the "govern" tab you can do this en mass, saving time. Same applys for upgrading ships, etc.\n-every planet has an event, which some may find annoying, but I think is good, allows you do add a slight layer of uniqueness to each planet as well as develop your ideology.\n-its actually more beneficial long terms to dabble in all ideologies to some extent, as long as your primary ideology has most points you wont have an ideological shift. This means you dont have to do the unrealistic option (as in some games with ideologies/religions) and devote 100% to an ideology. This also means, if desired, you can play on the basis of the moral choices involved for events/planets and still do OK in terms of ideological benefit (as opposed to number crunching the statistical/numerical benefits for each choice planet, etc)\n\nCons\n- diplomacy at first seems well developed, but that's only for early game. Late game diplomacy is at best, shallow, at worst, buggy. "Benevolent" ideologies seem to hate pragmatic ideologies as much as "malevolent" ideologies, which is silly and means that as a pragmatist, you need to kill anyone else who isn't a pragmatist and can only really form alliances with other pragmatists. This makes a diplomacy victory in a large game close to impossible without a decent military (because you need to kill anyone who refuses to ally with you), which means its always going to be predominantly a conquest based game.\n--continuing on for diplomacy: enemies will gladly colonise planets within starsystems you have partially colonized and there's no warning to tell them to ♥♥♥♥ off (as in games like CIV 5), and the same for resources. Early game is basically en-mass resource grab if you dont want to be screwed over mid/late game.\n-pirates/barbarians in 4X games are normally some kind of great equalizer early game to prevent a military/expansion snowball (eg sins of a solar empire, civ, etc), but in this game they're just annoying and dont do much besides kill the occasional scout. also, AI dont appear to be bothered by pirates, so its just a player handicap.\n-once you start going balls to the walls crazy large military, the game will start glitching out your "military power" parameter, which means for the purposes of diplomacy, one turn later everyone will think you're the weakest, declare war/♥♥♥♥ with you even though you could wipe them out. this also contributes to the impossiblity of a diplomacy victory (without killing loads of people)\n-terraforming in the incorrect order can cost you between 1-3 tiles per planet, which is a fair amount. eg if you use a higher grade terraformer on a "easy" tile, you wont be able to terraform the "harder" tiles, as late game you can terraform as many "easy" tiles as you like, meaning its better long term to hold off on terraforming until you've researched it fully as it isnt always clear which tiles are "easy" or "hard".\n-money is weak, it can take anywhere between 5-15 turns to be able to afford to rush construction (pretty much the only use of money, besides upgrading your military ships) whereas focusing on manufacturing allows you to build anything in 1-3 turns. Basically as long as you break even with your economy, you can just focus on manufacturing and research. Its actually usually better to just decommission old ships and build news ones rather than upgrade them (which will make you bankrupt quick if you have a large army)\n---In other words with the diplomacy + economy balancing, there is no viable economy based strategy or peaceful based strategy. No matter what, you will always need the strongest military regardless of your intended method of victory (unlike some other 4X games, where you could have an adequate military and with good diplomacy/economy still obtain most victory types you desire). And basically to get the strongest military you need to focus on research and manufacturing.\n- united galaxies is but a shallow addition to the game, furthermore, if someone ever defies (which is almost always), they are permanently booted, which can lead to the ridiculous situation of having a united galaxy meeting of 2 members, while the other 6-10 races are "defiant" (yet have not formed another united galaxies).\n\nmeh features:\n-culture. you must have decent culture to stop other races culture from "flipping" your planets, it also creates territorial space and (I think) it allows your ships to fly further into enemy space. problem is that if your culture is too strong it flips the planets of other races, including that of your allies. this makes your allies weaker and it entirely possible for them to be wiped off the map (further adding to the difficulty of a diplomacy victory). It also may land you a bunch of crap planets that you dont want to deal with. Fortunately you can give the ♥♥♥♥ planets to the minor races (who are immune to culture flipping)\n\nnote: most of these issues dont apply to multiplayer games, this is predominantly a critique of single player. although culture flipping feature will suck when playing co-op with friends.\n\nDo I regret buying the game at full price? a bit\nam I enjoying the game? yes\nshould you buy this game full price? only if you plan to win/enjoy by conquest every time or if you only care about multiplayer\nshould you buy this game on discount? yes, if it were at 25% discount it would be a good price\nit should be noted that stardock have a good trackrecord for improving/patching their games post release, so I anticipate that some of these issues I have raised will be gone in the future.","May 19, 2015","true","68.6"," 331 of 383 people (86%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","86","331","383","9","6"

So, I watched all the podcasts and read all the release notes. I watched features come and go and learned why from the developer himself. They were very transparent in everything they did and included in the game, they talked about its future and all that they had in store in DLC and just plain patches.\nI have read a lot of peoples reviews claiming the Apha was a brick and condeming  it in the early reviews, the problem to me on this, was that Stardock said  it was a brick.\nStardock always in all its states of the game told the buyers long before the game came out the state it was in. Yet the reviews that said don't buy this game kept coming up on steam.\nFor some reason all the Statements that kept saying Stardock was ripping people off and not telling the people what kind of game they would be purchasing was 100% not true.\n\nI suggest before you buy this game watch the streams, read the posts on the Stardock site and understand just what kind of game you are buying.\nIf you do this like I did there will be no disappoinments and you will enjoy the game for exactly what Stardock says your gaming experience will be.\n\nNow My game review\nFirst I will tell you the type of gamer I am . I play my games solo against the AI, never multiplayer so you will not see any thing about that mentioned in my review. I like immersive games and love the graphics, 3d , textures and partical effects in games. I zoom in and out to see details, in the games , I don't do quick moves, my graphics settings are the highest, I watch all my space battles and I like grand strategy , turn based games.\n\nWhile many Companies are trying to stop modding,  Stargate is welcoming it, though I am not a hardscale modder that alone gets my approval\n\nCinema Graphics, the opening and the Campaign opening gets you ready to start playing the game and for once the massive fleets you se depicted in the cinema graphic inserts can be at your command and Stardock takes it further in the campaign the opening cinema makes you hate the Dregin (again this is only if you play immersive ) and want to kill every one of them, in the cinema you see, the pocket universe fleet emerge and you say wow what power and unlike many games that don't live up to or even come close to there cinema story , Stardock hands you that pocket fleet in your first mission and tells you to go destroy Dregin, Then they give you a spectacler battle viewer to watch it all unfold.\nMissles streak across the screen, to be shot do by anti-missle systems, then beam weapons fire, and as the range closes, mass throwers throw projectiles into there victims, or they just bounce of the protective armor. Engine trails light up the screen, tiny to massive explosions dot the screen, there is no retreat in Gal Civ 3 only victor and loser. You can click on any ship for its vital information or slowly watch your fleet indicators turning from full strength to red while the top bar counts down you ships left in the fleet vs the enemies.\nYou can rewind and watch the battle again change the Camera view and watch it again.\n\nRaces available for play: There are less races for gal civ 3 then there were in Gal Civ 2 and Stardock explained this as the races appropriate for this story line, and Gal Civ 3 is more story based than Gal Civ 2. Stardock says that eventually the same races in Gal Civ 2 will be introduced as expansions with their further developed stories, but Stardock has included something to make your own story in the vast Gal Civ 3 universe a custom Race creator.\n\nHere is my brief experience and out come using that tool. I decided to make an insect based race based of a picture I found in the race image library , I named the race its leader and all its drive and motivations very quickly in this tool, I wrote  quick back story for flavor and after about an hour I had a race that I felt was very mantis bug like and put it into the game. So far it is one of the toughest un-yielding races I have ever run into, so once people get there custom races onto steam you can imagine all the possibilities Stardock has put out there to experience using this tool.\nfacing up too 100 different races with player written back stories will be quite exciting. My mantid race for instance will be quite a challenge.\n\nOk now onto building the universe to play in, from the development stream Stardocks goal was to make this game massive and if your computer can (and thank the maker mine can handle it) the amount of size and detail to their universe is mind boggling. There are so many different options of, size density, clusters, minor races, artifacts, richness, and the list goes on that you control or just through caution to the wind and put it all on random.\n\nNow your victory conditions, there are about 6 victory conditions you can turn off or on , some , one or all I like to play with all my self , but if you are a warmonger conquest can just be turned on but just remember all the races AI will change to a conquest intelligence and races that were usually peaceful in nature will have no choice but conquest. Of course to me there is nothing more annoying than the count down victory of an ascension victory for another race way across the galaxy.\n\nOK now the game builds the insane galaxy and I usually choose spiral to make it more like the milky way. On my computer it take about a minute to make it . Then poof lots of black and your home world, if your Terran its very familiar if not its a whole new experience. I no matter how many times I have played zoom all the way in and checked out my stars, planets, nebula's and ships, when you zoom in all the way you also get the ambient sound and hear the swirl of the nebular, the roar of the suns , with headphones of good quality  the back ground noise is amazing, when you move your ships and the engines cut in with sound and trails to me its like sipping a good glass of wine, and the ships the default ships are amazing but Stardock throws in a custom ship builder so if you want the Terran,s to be the Federation from that famous TV and movie series and if you are a terrible ship builder , other people can build the ships and you can bring them into your game. Gal Civ 2 had the ship builder as separate interface right of the start screen and in this version you have to be in game to use it , many people in there reviews act surprised at this but again Stardock said they were going to do it and why and they also said in a future patch they would try to tab it the way it was in 2 but that the new way they handle the builder it is easier said then done. Now to me when a company says this is what they are doing and why , I am not surprised when I open 1.0 and the tab is gone.\n\nThe tech tree, again all the reasons why they did what they did was explained by Stardock so no surprises to me and its fully mod-able, it has nice pull downs with lots of information, I can see for meta gamers it to be way too clunky but for  immersive gamers like me  I spend a lot of time in the tech tree.\n\nThe planet screen, when you first start out you have few choices and they are important ones , but this is not a tutorial this is a review. The interface is loaded with info, probably to much for a meta gamer but great for me , again I check out everything from top to bottom , and many complaints i read in the forums about planetary  invasion as an example, I laugh to my self and think how do you expect to throw off an invasion, without planetary defenses installed on your planet?  This interface is a very common sense interface.\n\nAt the text length limit.","May 18, 2015","true","032.4"," 425 of 529 people (80%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","80","425","529","26","16"

I want to love the game. I really do. I've played it a lot but most of my time has been bug-fixing. Fixing typos, errors, and what can only be described as sloppiness. It feels like I'm beta-testing a game and trying to patch the game myself. I've tried to push through this, but even ignoring all of the bugs and crashes gameplay itself is shallow. Civ5 has much deeper gameplay. GalCiv3's gameplay is just so simple. When you get down to it, past all of the glitter, it feels almost like a mobile game. There just isn't a lot of depth to the game.\n\nIf you are a die-hard 4x fan and can't get enough turn based space games, then go for it.\n\nThe rest of you? Stay far, far away. GalCiv3 in its current state is a bug riddled, bloated, crashy, unstable mess. Expect your game to crash to desktop without any warning or error messages. Fortunately it has autosave, but there are so many stability problems that you're going to need those autosaves.\n\nTo start with, the positives. The game is gorgeous. It looks so very pretty. The ship designer is amazing. You can design almost any ship you want, anything from an Imperial Star Destroyer to one of Starfleet's finest. The level of customization is immense. The game is also very easy to mod as it is based on xml files, so tinkering is easy. All you need is notepad.\n\nUnfortunately I've now finished the list of positive aspects of the game.\n\nThe game is riddled with typos, both spelling errors visible in the game as well as typos in the xml files that run the game behind the scenes. Research buildings are flagged as factories. Ship blueprints are poorly written, so that ships will be built with the wrong ship modules or missing vital ship modules entirely. This also leads to a very poorly performing AI because it is stuck with the stock ships. You can design your own ships, and by designing a well balanced ship you will be able to smash the AI.\n\nTo make up for this, at high difficulty levels the AI blatantly cheats. This game doesn't have an advanced AI. Its only made challenging by cheating. The AI ignores fog of war. It gets free production, free money, and free science. Its ships get more range and can install more modules than you. It also outright gets free technology every few turns. It needs all of these things to keep pace with a human player, and even then, the AI isn't much of a challenge except for sheer brute force due to cheating.\n\nThe AI isn't clever. It appears to pick a random planet to attack. It builds lots of ships and keeps flying it at that planet until it gets lucky. Unfortunately the AI forgets to build any transports on a regular basis, so it has trouble actually capturing planets. Diplomacy with the AI is very limited. You can trade things with the AI and you can declare war/peace with the AI. Thats about it. Want to get one AI to form an alliance with another AI? Can't do it. You can ally with everyone but you cannot broker peace in the galaxy. The AI's diplomacy is also mostly based on power. Do you have the most ships? Everyone loves you. Do you have the weakest fleet out of everyone? Everyone hates you and will declare war on you. Thats about as fancy as the AI gets.\n\nThe game is immensely bloated. 6gb of RAM isn't recommended. 6gb of RAM is barely the minimum. The game can use upwards of 5gb of RAM just by itself. Windows is going go use anywhere from 2-3gb of RAM. You need at least 6gb of RAM free. Not installed, but free/unused RAM. So you're looking at 10-12 of installed RAM to properly play this game.\n\nIn terms of visuals the game sure is pretty, but its pretty on par with Civ5. Its a turn based strategy game. However the memory usage far exceeds that of Civ5. Your computer may be able to play Civ5 without a hitch, but its going to crawl on GalCiv3. For some reason the game uses vast amounts of system resources (mostly memory) but it doesn't use them efficiently in an way. Expect your page file to get a lot of work. Your virtual memory is just a swap file on your hard drive. This file is going to get a ton of usage due to the memory requirements for this game. Hard drives are very slow things and virtual memory is to be avoided at all costs due to its terrible performance. Well, for GalCiv3, thats just what happens. Expect to chug along, especially if you're trying to play on a bigger map.\n\nManagement of your empire in game is also a chore. It chugs along. There is zero macro-management and zero automation. You have to micromanage every single planet, starbase, fleet, and ship in your empire every turn. On a tiny map its tolerable, but on big maps? Its micro management hell. And its not the fun kind of micro management. Its pure busywork. Its pure tedium. Starbases are particularly bad. They require a staggering degree of babysitting. Even planets, if you have a lot of them, get bad. There is no way to automate any planets in your empire. On a big map you might have dozens or potentially even hundreds of planets on the biggest map size. Every single planet must be manually ordered to do everything. Its just not fun. It is absolutely tedious.\n\nThat said, negatives aside, the game has a lot of potential, but it feels like I'm playing an early beta build. Its just so rough. The game feels so unfinished. This game is not ready for release yet. Not even close. This is not a finished product nor should it be advertised as one. It hasn't even been optimized yet. It is a bloated, buggy, incomplete mess, but at the same time it is a gem in the rough.\n\nUnfortunately gems in the rough aren't worth much. They need to be polished first. GalCiv3 is lacking any and all polish. For comparison, I'd say that Dwarf Fortress has fewer bugs and is more stable than GalCiv3. Dwarf Fortress feels more polished than GalCiv3.\n\nThats right. You heard me right.\n\nDwarf Fortress  is a more polished, stable, and bug-free game than GalCiv3.\n\nSo if you're a die hard 4x fan and want another 4x game regardless of how unfinished it is, by all means, pick up GalCiv3.

While the rollout of the beta updates has been slower than I would like, the game is finally at a point where it is playable. It still needs a lot of work and a significant ramp-up of the AI, but I am starting to see the game take the shape I was hoping it would.\n\nNote that I have played every AI difficultly so far.\n\nFeedback for the designers:\n- The game engine is running well. I rarely see a point where it is just sitting there processing something or slow/clipping. Keep up the good work as everything is added in!\n- Have the AI place a higher price on their ships. I am able to trade for a enemy ship with cash only and pay FAR less than it would cost me to rush production. The price for a trade or a rush should be a lot closer. This is most evident in the initial survey ship. I find it hilarious that I can quick research Universal Translator and immediately buy everyone else's survey ship by trading open borders and a small amount of cash, leaving all anomylies on the map to me only (which pays back that cash VERY quickly, not to mention the awesome bonuses).\n- The price they place on their starbases is more appropriate than the ships, but could also be raised a bit (especially mid-to-late game).\n- Have the AI be more effective when trading techs with each other, and come to the human player with trading opportunities. It is almost laughable that I can "make the rounds" in the diplomacy window every 25 or 30 turns, only trade one of my techs, re-trade everyone else, and end up so far ahead in tech, cash, and ships as a result.\n- The Ultra-Terraformer is TOO EPIC! If it is that powerful it should cost a lot more of research or the AI should place a lot higher value on that line of research. So far, I have been able to ping-pong back and forth between manufacturing and research techs (keeping tech pace with the other races through trading), then start researching the terraforming line once the majority of my planets have built the majority of their buildings. Once I get to Ultra-Terraformer, the game is essentially over because I am able to build top-tier ships in a single turn due to the manufacturing adjacency bonuses. Another example is that with only 2 economic-centric planets I was able to get a per-turn income of 8K just from those 2 planets; no more need to trade techs...just buy them from the other races!\n- I'm not certain how the Hyperion Shrinker actually works. The ship designer doesn't allow me to build a design specific to a shipyard (that I can tell), and the help text on the Shrinker seems to indicate that it only affects the shipyard the planet is sponsoring. Am I able to fit in more ship components on my Shrinker planet somehow? Or is the help text just wrong and it actually applies globally?\n- I have run into many crashes, which have mostly been a result of me trying to perform operations too quickly or taking actions while a turn was running. I assume that these crashes are reported to you automatically, but might it help if you pop'd up a message window on crash where I could explain what I was doing? In many cases, I could almost write the bug report for you because by the 2nd or 3rd crash repeat (loading from autosave) I have a very good idea of what type of (if not the exact repeatable) action that I know caused the crash.\n- After playing around with the various "Rare, Uncommon, Common, Abundant" settings, I am a bit confused by how the map creator determines what is actually generated. It would be great if you could provide an approximate number of black holes, stars, planets, ratio of habitable planets, etc on the game creation screen so that I could adjust the dropdowns so that the map is created how I expect. My personal ideal map for small and medium sizes consists of 2-3 habitable star systems per race which contain a total of 4-5 habitable planets within the system group. So for 6 players I would want between 12-18 stars with habitable planets and 24-30 habitable planets spread amongst them, but I am having trouble determining how to get the generator to actually create that consistently.","December 14, 2014","true","148.0"," 144 of 165 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","144","165","2","0"

Yeah, I'm sorry Stardock, but you don't get to call your game a "beta" yet. Late-alpha at most. Certainly nowhere near beta.\nWhen the chance of getting the game running off the bat is something of a 50-50 due to a graphical bug that can render all UI text invisible, you're not a beta.\nNow, I only recently got into the Gal Civs 3 "beta" but from what I've gathered on the game's forum, that little issue has been around since the last apha build. So there's that to look forward to if you just got the game.\nThe issue's "easily averted" by telling the game to not use your dedicated graphics card. And once you're past that, well then- Welcome to Gal Civs 3: COMING SOON. Ok, I won't rip on an Early Access game for not having all its' features present. But really?\n"Beta" implies you're "feature-complete". I.e- you've implemented all of the major mechanics and features you intend for your game and are balancing and tweaking them for best effect, along with dusting for the odd bug.\nThe current state of the Gal Civs 3 "Beta 1" is missing all sorts of features. From tactical combat to the above-mentioned Diplomacy mechanic. Instead, once you meet another faction you're immediately considered "at war forever", which makes playing against more than one opponent tricky at best since they will all kinda gang-up on you. Even if they them selves are technically at war with eachother, the AI will much prefer targeting your ships and colonies over other factions'.\nTargeting ships and other stellar... targets (wow, such vocabulary) in itself is kind of underwhelming since fleets in themselves aren't really a thing yet either. Meaning most of the combat will involve single ships. Winners are auto-determined by a stat-check and apparently nobody bothered telling captains that retreat is an option.\nThe game also seems to have a hard time letting go of its' pre-made ship designs. It generates a "new version" of the stock designs every time you unlock a new technology (even if it had nothing to do with spaceships). What's either sadder or funnier about it (also irritating) is that they're not even slightly different than the previous version it gave you. Unless you've unlocked a new module, that Corvette M1459 will be the same as the Corvette M1458. It just adds the next number up after the name of the design. No, game... I know you spent many a sleepless night over those blueprints but why would I use designs that are inferior to the ones I come up with. That and mine are inspired by Star Trek... Yours look good and all, but again... Star. Trek. (I mean the designer literally has all the parts you need to make your own TOS Enterprise or TNG Warbird.)\nSpeaking of the ship designer. Who's the genious that made the background pitch black and then gave the parts' no lighting effects when viewed from below? I already wear glasses. You're not helping, game... The camera controls are also glitchy at times and somewhat frustrating, but that can be deat with. The designer also fails to tell you what direction is forward. Or to give you a unified indication of which direction you're augmenting a part (dimensions are relative in space). So if you ever wanted to see how the USS Enterprise moves in reverse... You can do that...\nOther than that, I don't have any major complaints. Some part models are missing thumbnails and the player-made ships don't have thumbnails as well, but at this time, that's a non-issue.\nThe designer is really impressive, quirks aside. Other "reviewers" compare it to the Spore one, since I'm guessing the one from Gal Civs 2 is before their time. But to compare it to its' past iterration would be like comparing a crossbow and a rifle.\nAlthough not that graphically advanced, the fidelity of the game's textures is impressive. I can see why they're going for the whole "64-bit development only". And both the devs and I do mean it- if you're hoping to somehow frankenstein this on a 32-bit machine- forget it, the warning at the top of the Steam page is there for a reason. Even the smallest maps available are quite big and the game renders everything at all times. Ship icons on the map are the fully-rendered model of the ship in question, rendered to its' fullest. There can be a dozen black holes on the map, all animated and spinning at all times, as well as stars with planets and moons; and although planets don't spin around their suns (yet?), the moons do. There's also nebulae, dust clouds and asteroid fields, as well as randomly generated wormholes that can be used as shortcuts around the map (if you don't mind not knowing where you'll end up). And everything's always on. For all factions. The game doesn't drop a single model off memory.\nWhich means that A) It runs like a truck. Alt-Tabbing is guresome, albeit not impossible, even when running it in a window. Loading times are also a pain. With optimisation it's probably gonna get better. But then again B) The actual in-game response is really nice. Once everything's been loaded at least once, the only long waits you're gonna have are if you're loading between multiple saves. You'll still get the odd stutter but that's usually when the game autosaves and takes only a second.\nThe technology and ideology trees are vast. Really, really vast. If you thought the "tech-web" from the upcoming Civ: Beyond Earth was staggering... This might just one-up it. While not an "interconnecting web with randomised technologies" and still sticking to the tried-and-true linear tree, each faction gets its' own, separate, technologies with different benefits, increasing the variety available to the player. The whole "age of expansion, war and ascention" thing means that at certain times, different techs will cost more or less turns, depending on what tree they're from. Since the ages actually progress as you research technologies under them, it also means that you can't actually research every single technology (as far as I can assume, haven't gotten to the end yet; will change as I do).\nThe ideology system is equally interesting, albeit as of yet not fully-featured. As you colonise worlds you'll get events with a Pragmatic, Benevolent or Merciless resolution. Each adding to a pool of points you can spend towards some form of passive benefit. That's pretty much all there's to it right now but I'm intrigued at how they advance this feature.\nAnd that sums it up, for now. The AI is from what I can tell limited to "expand as much as possible and produce as many ships as possible" which usually means they have control of about half the map by the time you encounter them and from then-on you get regularly assaulted by the stock "bomber" ships of the faction of your choosing, only later, and then still rarely, being "graced" by a larger vessel's incursion. Imagine someone releasing a swarm of mosquitoes that only comes in small waves and you have a bug-zapper and infinite supply of repellant. Not really a challenge unless on higher difficulties but I'm expecting that to change once they add Diplomacy and fully-feature the tactical combat.\nOther than that, I have nothing else to say about the Galactic Civilisations 3 "Beta".\nDue to Steam insisting on the "yay-or-nay" system, I'm going to "thumb up" this just because I have faith in the franchise.\nHowever. I will insist on what I said in the begining. A "beta" is "feature-complete" and Gal Civs 3 is anything but that. Do not buy into it at its' current version ("Beta 1"/Ver 0.40) unless you're absolutely OK with not having a fully-featured game. As a long-stanging Kerbal Space Program fan, I can deal with that. But you need to answer that question for yourself. Think before you buy.\n\nAddendum: I would strongly recommend the opt-in patch.","August 19, 2014","true","163.0"," 326 of 422 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","326","422","0","24"

I do that as well. When I say I would not recommend this game, it is not because it is not a good, or even great, game. I absolutely love it. However, this is not a game for everyone. This is not a game most of my gamer friends could get behind, even those who love strategy games. It is far too...exotic, that it almost feels like it strives for a niche market instead of a mainstream game. Thus, I would not 'recommend' it. But, if you are reading this, then you have interest in 4x, grand strategy, or at least some form of strategy games. And in that regard, consider it, at the least. It is one of the most intricate and complicated strategy games I have ever played, from Warcraft to Total War. But I do not recommend it for the following reasons.\n\n1) This game is hard to learn. Or at least quickly. My first few playthroughs on the campaign, I was always beaten, and on a custom game, I was crushed. The learning curve is brutal. It was very oppressing to have enemies invading you with these advanced ships, or with many times your own fleet, because you don't understand the minute specifics of the game. Once you grasp it, it becomes SIGNIFICANTLY easier. But for those whom do not have the patience to learn it, or are just not willing to reduce themselves to learning strategies online, this game will likely disappoint.\n\n2) The A.I. is far too predictable. Now, perhaps it is simply me, but after a few playthroughs, each race had a fairly predictable course of technology and action. Some focused on creating a tremendous amount of influence to make others not hate them, some tried to be great merchants and sell and buy everything, some tried to bully their way into everything. It eventually comes to a point where the game is far more interesting to craft races to combat.\n\n3) Military might is overpowered. Now, I understand why, at least a bit. However, those races that choose the malevolent path, and focus on building the power and size of their fleets, will utterly crush the opposition. Playing on the largest map setting, by the time I had started exploring the galaxy, I found that those who were invading conquerers were plentiful compared to the other paths, as they did not have the means to survive their enemies. This could be overcome by enemies that split their focus a bit, and researched technologies in other trees, but for the most part, opponent A.I. is very singleminded, and thus, only the strong-minded survive.","December 23, 2015","false","115.5"," 601 of 815 people (74%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","74","601","815","21","30"

I thought this would be more awesomeness with a better updated skin, but unfortunately it's not. Of course I picked up GalCiv2 after Anor, so maybe I'm used to something more mature?\n\nPros- This game looks great. The graphics don't disappoint, the ships and effects are awesome. Building your own ships is a lot of fun and some of the ships on the workshop are amazing. The new planitary setup where adjacency matters makes for more thoughtful colony decision making. Creating you own faction also has a lot of fun options to try.\n\nCons- I really don't like having to setup the same treaty (open borders, exploration, etc) every 50 turns. Having to babysit diplomacy, while possibly realistic, is not something I enjoy in a game. The AI is also illigical to put it mildly. Factions constantly beg you for free stuff (tech or money), then you suffer a diplomatic penalty with them if you don't give it to them. How is that a good idea?\n\nAnyway I was stoked for this game and was disapointed.

I had (and still have) high hopes for this game, bought into the prerelease and followed its development. I'm a fan of Stardock, and have often suggested their apps to clients in my PC repair work.\n\nThis game takes the overall Galciv formula, which is an amazing take on 4X allowing both depth, as well as intuitive/satisfying gameplay. The reason that this series is one of the best 4X Space games around is that it gives a wide range of customization, with very little micromanagement.\n\nGal Civ 3 brings in a bunch of great new features such as off-planet shipyards, specialized ship components, some improved game customization, and the much needed new pile of content for those like myself who have burned themselves out on the wonderful universe of Gal Civ 2.\nI really love the on-planet adjacent tile bonuses, and the strategic resources. Strategic resources add a whole new realm of combat, fighting over otherwise empty systems and giving you some great design choices to buffer against research lag (Building a few ships utilizing special mass drivers and elerium beams saved me from a race that suddenly appeared equipped with advanced missile defense technology after I sunk all my research down that weapon route; giving players more tactical options like this really gives the gameplay some depth).\n\nThere are quite a few changes that I don't agree with, but I think have some merit and can develop into improvements in the long run: The replacement of world projects with luxury resources, ship defenses decreasing when used instead of applying against every attack, the new research screen (thank goodness you can still switch over to the standard tree view). I also miss the space station appearance changes as you upgrade them (they persist in this version for only the first few upgrades, after which you are stuck with a very generic looking station).\n\nOn the subject of space stations, the military one is seriously nerfed in Gal Civ 3. Whereas before they were incredibly helpful fortresses to build around your most integral planets, now they really just provide minor buffs. They’ll tip the scales but by no means serve as the your defense forces’ fulcrums any longer.\n\nI have a few minor gripes such as where did the AI personality go? The only messages I get in game are the generic “You’re a noob to have so few warships. I’m going to eat your parents!” messages when my ship count is low, or the “Yeah I’m going to invade you now, l8r” transmissions. I’d love to see some more personality in the AI scripts that split them apart a bit, and maybe even some storyline/quest like communications that can be thrown in.\n\nOne other minor bug is that whenever I exit the game I have to go into task manager and kill every process that doesn’t look normal to get my computer to run at anywhere near modern computer speeds (Some component seems to glitch out and take up tons of resources but does not show up in procmon).\n\nTwo major areas are killing this game though-\n\n1.	A vast number of features that have simply been stripped in this iteration, including several that had previously been the source of much of the games charm. Where is asteroid mining, ship leveling, espionage, the charts screen, civilization party elections.\n\nThe Tech tree has been cut down SEVERELY. The nebulous tech tree in Gal Civ 2, with its charming comedic wit has been reduced to a very simple and limited version with much drier text. The lack of witty or even useful descriptions and tooltips throughout make the whole game seem much more sterile and flat.\n\n2. The MASSIVE Battle Results bug. So the battle viewer doesn't work well to begin with, cinematic view just sits there doing nothing, but the real issue is that battles that you watch seldom actually turn out the way they are displayed.\n\nFor example you have a fleet of four ships, so does the enemy. They start pounding away at each other, and half of their ships get stuck at 0HP, but are still firing away, well no big deal because it glitches for your ships too sometimes, maybe it evens out. Get to the end of the battle, you lost two ships while the enemy lost all four, *whew* tough battle, click "OK". It cuts back to the galactic map and what do you know the enemy has two ships that survived and your whole fleet has been destroyed. This occurs in my games in about 50% of all battles, and 9 times out of 10 to my detriment.\n\nBecause it often works against the player I think the problem may be with some of the new ship components such as weapons rechargers that make your guns shoot faster but do less damage, or maneuvering jets that get you in range of the enemy quicker and allow you to dodge a few of their shots. My guess is these new components work correctly in the viewer, but the actual battle results use a different equation solely based upon weapon and defense numbers. The AI doesn't use these components much.\n\nAs it is, this a game breaker. Playing in pre-release with no battle-viewer was boring but acceptable for pre-release. This now working (kinda) version does nothing but add frustration, and if my hypothesis concerning new components not working in battle is true the situation is even worse since the new ship components are one of Gal Civ 3's few major pluses over its predecessors.\nI hope they continue to flesh out this iteration. The game engine, though a bit glitchy and poorly optimized (jump from one side of the galaxy to the other on a large map and the game hangs for a good 15 seconds) seems remarkably versatile. I think there is some great potential here, and I look forward to some improvements.\n\nAs it stands if asked if you should purchase this game I’d be split 50/50 at full price, but I would say definitely get it if they fix the battle results bug. Until they do I cannot justify the purchase unless it’s on sale.","September 22, 2015","false","121.1"," 177 of 223 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","177","223","4","6"

If you'd like to try this game do so with the knowledge that features may be missing or not working yet.\n\nOverall impressions are good - the game feels identical to the previous installment and yet brings with it new mechanics and features which greatly improve upon it.\nI was skeptical at first as a big fan of the previous game, and the genre in general.\nIn the early days I would tend to agree with some of these negative reviews, lots of bugs, lots of crashing, lots of lagging - but what do you know, they went and fixed all that (an example of why you should ignore reviews this early on!).\n\nColonies are much easier to manage than they were in the previous game, you simply choose you buildings up front and as you research new techs everything is upgraded for you.\nThere's a nice little feature where colonies can share space ports, allowing you to have (in theory) double the amount of production in that centre.  This is great for players who focus on money, influence or other factors.\n\nStarbases aren't finished yet so there is no point in reviewing them.  Same basic mechanics as the last one with the addition of new modules and mining mechanics.\n\nCombat is greatly improved, no longer do all of your weapons fire immediately and your mass of lasers simply destroys everything up front.\nNow weapons have more realistic and varied fire rates, which can be modified by ship modules and research to customise your ships more (for example, loading lots of rapid fire mods onto powerful missiles).\nDefence needs a bit of work IMO as defence are quickly worn down by weapons.  Two shots from a laser with 30 damage will take out a ship with 60 shields.  Sounds sensible, but there's nothing to stop you loading dozens of fighters with huge lasers to wipe out capital ships.  Most Space RTS suffer from the same issue, so this is more a personnal bug bear than a problem.\n\nDiplomacy is relatively straight forward, what you see is what you get.  Tech, finance and treaty trading.  The UN resolutions add some more dynamics but they soon get old when you realise 90% of them would hinder you...\n\nInfluence has been improved a lot, now if you occupy a planet deep within another player's influence it will be almost immediately transfered to the other player.  This stops those pesky AIs colonising Mars for no discernable reason!\n\nThe tech tree is great in this game as you can either research improvements or new techs.  "Do I really want a new type of laser, or do I want to improve the one I've got?".  Obviously the answer to this will be "Eh, I'll take both thanks" but it's a good start and does much more to change the way you play "One more tech then I'll make my new ships, promise!".\n\nShip design has gotten a whole lot easier as internal hardpoints are now hidden, so it's much easier to attach things where you want them than it was before.  Great for creative types.\n\nNothing on planetary invasion yet, so I can't comment here.\n\nTo sum up it's a good start and definitely work keeping an eye on it.  Unless you're really interested in it's developmet there isn't much point buying it just yet (unless you're keen to get bonus stuff when it comes out like they usually do...).\n\nPlenty of +/-ve reviews out there, none are helpful in the slightest at the moment.  Keep watching, keep reading and reserve your judgement until you play it yourself or the full game comes out.\n\nHope this helps clarify what's what objectively at this stage.\n\nOh, the dev team has also been very good in responding to bugs and issues.

It's often indistinguishable from Civilization V, but that's not a bad thing (unless you're paid to judge works on uniqueness.)\nThe depth added by designing our own combat units is interesting and allows for more freedom than other similar games when planning strategy. For example, rather than stumble about blindly or use up mass allowances on combat vessels, you might take a page from modern AEW&C. Or perhaps develop a raider doctrine with long-range, independent vessels capable of hunting alone. Or combine the two and create hunter-killer teams. There's huge potential to evade some of the worst aspects of min-max play in just this one concept.\nSpaceships!\nCons:\nRather buggy for a game priced in the AAA range. Not that AAA titles are bug-free at first release, but that doesn't make it less annoying to pay more to buy less quality earlier. The ship designer in particular is a bug-ridden mess. And that's not a small problem for a game with few other reasons to play it over similar titles.\nThe ship designer user experience--bugs withstanding--would have been reasonable ten years ago. Not today; especially with other, cheaper, vehicle building games out there such as Kerbal Space Program. It's so out of line with modern user experience it feels like Stardock is laughing at us. I've little hope this will improve much, as perusing the early access forums reveals players were pointing out some of the current problems long ago.\nAt times, it feels like Civilization V with a different skin; same pleasures, same annoyances. From the direction early game faction scouts and settlers drive play to the over-engineered leader "discussion/diplomacy" screens containing dialogue even less relevant than a response from Eliza, it can feel an awful lot like an outside contractor team revamped Civilization V without understanding it--and therefore not knowing how to qualitatively improve it.\nThe user interface glitter and glam leaves the impression the team wanted to match Civilization V dollar for dollar, but ran out of time or money. And that is a shame, because so many great games have shown us glitter, sprinkles, and twirly umbrellas in the user interface don't fundamentally improve the play experience and here that money and time was clearly needed elsewhere, e.g., the help system.\nThe help system. Or lack thereof. A few tutorials that start strong and fizzle out. Little to nothing in-game and no real manual to speak of. This is a game much like chess, where mechanics are made up solely to balance one another and so one's intuition and life experience have nothing to contribute (and folks who paid even slight attention in physics or astrophysics 101 are going to be at a disadvantage.) So direct explanation of mechanics of play is essential, and almost entirely missing. Again, for cheaper titles with established forums and wikis, this is palatable. Not so for a title priced in this range.\nAnd, the big problem. The play simply does not balance when playing the largest map sizes. And the largest map sizes are presented as a significant differentiator from other like-minded titles.\nI hope Stardock builds upon this in the coming months with updates; it's a game I'd love to love. There's a mountain of potential here if they find the budget and courage to come at some of the genre's problems and their solutions with fresh eyes. But, today it's not in the same league as other titles in the same price range nor is does it have the unique personality or creativity of its cheaper, indie brethren.\n\n[Updates]\nI've played around with this a little more. Few more things I've noticed:\nThe opponent AI feels inferior to Civilization V, or even to Eliza. I feel as if I've I've as much chance of calling a random die roll as guessing what an AI-controlled opponent will say or do. Not to mention to the glaring inconsistencies, e.g., declaring war one turn and telling you they'll probably declare war on you the next. There's no sense of connection or rationality.\nThe battle mechanic, or lack of one, is uninteresting, even pointless. You move your ships onto enemy ships (or vice versa) and a seemingly straight calculation is performed to determine the winner. I've tried saving and loading a dozen times before a few close battles and saw zero variation in outcome. Moreover, you have no input on battle tactics other than selecting as part of ship design what role a ship will play, i.e., you fix ship roles before construction. But that's not a real problem: roles are too simplistic to have any profound effect. You cannot call a retreat, ships gain no experience and have nothing to differentiate them from one another. Very like chess, very unlike other modern, deep 4X titles.\nAfter a little more play; the feel is even more cardboard, generic, soulless. There's nothing to differentiate it from deeper, more accomplished titles except the concept of a ship designer; and that sabotaged by a poor implementation in comparison to its competitors.","May 20, 2015","false","27.5"," 221 of 291 people (76%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","76","221","291","11","6"

I have literally thousands of hours clocked in GC1 & 2, and feel I have given GC3 a good chance.\n\nSomewhere in there is a great game, but it is going to need a lot of help getting out. The problems are too numerous to list in total, so I'll just point out the worst examples:\n\n1. If there is a textbook telling designers how not to create a UI, then GC3 UI designers have followed it to the letter - constant moving from one side of the screen to the other with the mouse, as buttons / clickable options just seem to be randomly placed. Very limited keyboard shortcuts. Completely unsortable lists of ships / planets / starbases etc. You can't even change what a planet / shipyard is producing from these lists (like you could in GC2). The whole thing is a recipe for carpal tunnel!\n\n2. Micro-management hell. The production wheel is a nightmare - setting anything to 100% is a game in itself, trying to drag the pointer on to the one pixel on the screen that does so. You can't progress to the next turn until every planet / ship has a valid order (even if that is just do nothing). Really useful when an AI surrenders to you and dumps you with 800+ ships. Yeah, thanks for that - quit game!\n\n3. Diplomacy is so broken, it is beyond hilarious. As an example of what you can do... I just started a Suicidal difficulty game, gigantic galaxy, all stock AIs on "Godlike" intelligence. I researched Universal Translator, then set 100% economy and built nothing. No ships, no planetary improvements, nothing. By turn 35 I had 182 planets, 54 starbases, and was earning 14000bc per turn - yep, the godlike AI just gave me everything they had as soon as they met me.\n\nTime to move on - hopefully Stardock will fix this game, but I'm not sure I'll be back to check or not.","May 24, 2015","false","139.4"," 218 of 288 people (76%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","76","218","288","26","4"

Unfortunately this game has missed the mark, Stardock just didn't do enough with the franchise to give it 'new life', and while some things they did were exceptional (the customization of everything, see below), it has too many negatives to warrent a recommendation, especially for the price of $50, this is not a $50 title.\n\nWhat GalCiv3 did right:\n- Ship customization is FANTASTIC, they hit the ball out of the park with this one.\n- Custom race creation and balance is really interesting and in-depth, great stuff.\n- Custom game setup options are plentiful, letting you tune the game to the experience you want.\n\nAreas GalCiv3 falls short:\n- The Combat animations are bare bones at best, and while this would be bearable (the particle effects are good, as are the ship models which are completely customizable as mentioned above), the camera controls/modes for viewing are beyond poor, the ship pathfinding for movement is really poor (battles just proceed in exactly the same paths again and again) and the space skyboxes are AWFUL. This really lets it down.\n- As just mentioned the space skyboxes are not very pleasant\n- The Campaign is not really worth bothering with. It sadly feels like a last minute stitched together skirmish game that unfortunately really doesn't show much love and care.\n- The User Interface isn't fantastic by any means. While it's not terrible, there are many unnecessary/overly complicated tabs and windows that just don't need to be there. A Perfect example is the comparison between the Research page in this game compared to the Research page in another Stardock (published) title "Sins of a Solar Empire", SoaSE does a much better job than this game in terms of UI in areas like that. GalCiv just feels clunky.\n- No where near enough new content or innovation to make this a worthy successor to GalCiv2. I could have forgiven it if it was an almost PERFECT execution (I adore Homeworld: Remastered, while it does have a few faults, that game is a stunning remake), this game just has so many flaws I just don't get excited when playing it.\n\n\nTL;DR: Customization options are fantastic, but the game just doesnt feel polished.

I'll mention what, for me, makes this game great:\n\n* A wicked AI.  Seriously.  I prefer to play 4x games solo.  I need a good AI to keep me challenged and interested.  On the Challenging difficulty setting, the AI expanded at about the same rate I did (sometimes a little faster), kept up with me technologically and economically, even sent warships ahead of its colony ships to clear out pirates so it could colonize worlds before I could.  It designed its warships to counter the strength of my warships (since we shared a border).  It understood the threat when I moved warships close to its border, which affected our diplomatic relations.  And so much more.\n\n* The Ship Designer.  No other 4x game (or other game that I know of) gives you so much freedom and control in designing your own ships (if you want to; it has a basic template of ships if you don't).  From a palette of basic ship parts, combined with powerful design and even animation tools, you can create awesome looking ships that actually work and fight in the game.  Yes, weapon, defense, and other components matter in the game and can mean the difference between defeat and victory, but designing my own ships and seeing them in the game is just SO COOL.  I even created a warship that looked like a mythical dragon.\n\n* Custom civilizations.  Powerful but simple menus allow you to create your own civilizations quickly, providing many different traits, behaviors, and strategy options.  Ten opponents not enough?  Make 20 more!  Each of them different.  You can even play sandbox games as one of your custom civilizations (which I do).\n\n* Modding.  This game is designed with modders in mind.  Don't like something about the game?  Change it!  There is hardly any gameplay aspect of this game you cannot mess with.\n\n* Insane map.  I like big maps and I cannot lie.  Okay, not everyone enjoys really big maps with thousands of stars.  But if you do, the insane map is for you.  (Beware that management of your empire can take awhile on a map like this.)\n\nThere's lots more and I highly recommend this game.  And, Stardock has committed to supporting this game for years to come.  As good as the game is now, it's going to get even better.","May 13, 2015","true","805.4"," 130 of 171 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","130","171","7","4"

It's not a bad game.  It just isn't exceptional.  Ship building is bugged currently.  The game itself froze up on me a few times but after a fresh install seemed to run better.  It still stutters at times, even on the small tutorial map.  Combat is uninteresting.  You have no capacity to command your units, not even to flee.  So you send your guys in and hope for the best.  Worse, the combat camera is fairly horrible and you spend a lot of the time listening to battles happening off screen.  It's a bit chaotic.\n\nI have read that diplomacy is a greatly improved in this game.  If so I didn't see it.  In the two games I have played so far my allies seemed fairly erratic, almost like a crazy person you find yourself dating after an online hook up.  One minute they threatened to obliterate me for not following their doctrine.  The next minute they are showering me with credits as though they feel badly about how they acted and are desperate for you not to leave them.\n\nIf there is colony management automation I couldn't find it.  Managing your economy is a matter of moving a slider.  Again, not bad.  Just not interesting.\n\nThe Universe in the couple of games I have played seems fairly lifeless.  At first black holes look really neat.  But there are no civilian ships to be seen.  No convoys.  Besides some basic animation of a moon orbit or the odd comet it seems like you are looking at a stagnate game board.  Again, not bad per say.  Just not interesting.\n\nTowards the end of the games I found myself clicking a lot to just shuffle through turns so I could finally get to the tipping point of overwhelming my enemy.  This involved stripping his final system of defenders and then doing a sort of auto resolution troop invasion.  Then a wall of exposition and a victory screen.  It was around this point that I realized that finishing the game had been more work than actual fun.\n\nThere may be a solid core of a good game here that can be greatly improved upon with further patches and DLC.  But for $10 more you can buy Distant Worlds Universe.  With a bevy of mods that make it a living breathing universe.  Or just play some Gal Civ 2.  Or Sins of a Solar Empire.  I do not recommend dumping $50 into Gal Civ 3 at present.

It took me about two hours of researching to find solutions and playing around with the game's files to finally get it going for that first time. Then, the game continued to crash during play time. So, yet another hour or so of my time to find methods of keeping it running properly. The mothertrucker still crashes to this day at times.\n\nThat right there costs the game some big points in my esteem. When I pay 50 bucks for your game, it better damn well work the first time I click on it (unless my computer is the problem-- which it was not in this case.)\n\nTechnical issues aside (as glaring as they are), this is a really lackluster, mediocre game. Nothing special to see here folks.\n\nDiplomacy is pretty standard with nothing deep going on there. It's the standard trade agreement that we have already seen in hundreds of such games before (give me this tech for that tech, declare war, etc). The diplomacy system in older games (Alpha Centauri among others) is probably much more complex. If anything, diplomacy is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with the AI factions acting all bi-polar on you. They shower you with praise and credits at one moment, then they declare war two turns later. I enjoyed the quasi-United Nations thing they had going there though (planetary alliance or something). That was a neat highlight.\n\nThere is no ground combat / planetary invasions - defense game system. It's a very random thing. In most of my playing, taking over a planet is pretty automatic. Very rarely did I need to send in a second wave of invading forces. You don't need to prepare too much in advance. Planets that are outfitted to the wazoo with defensive things still get taken down fairly easy. Honestly, why has no game of this sort not put some thought into the ground game? Look at Emperor of the Fading Suns. There's a great old game that did that in a very fun and engrossing fashion. Seriously, no one has even touched the ground game in years.\n\nThe space combat is ridiculous. You have zero options or control. Starships fly and charge at each other like cavalry. Once close to the enermy, they then begin to rotate around each other in a dancing fashion and deal their damage. Seeing capital starships fly in circles around one another like fighters in some kind of demented NASCAR dogfight took a lot of punch away from the highlight of the game (starship battles). I found myself skipping the combat scenes pretty early on because A) You can't do anything anyways and the ships are governed by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cavalry charge tactic. 2) It makes me laugh because it's so off putting... the way the ships dance around each other in a circle.\nSeriously, give the player some tactical control. Make the game interesting by still having a chance to win even if you're the underdog with the smarter opponent having an edge of some kind.\n\nThe universe is pretty dead. Ships take forever to get to all the corners of the open space. No jump drives or something that could speed up fleet movement over the map. This isn't even slow burn tension, it's like driving a golf cart for 8 hours.\n\nThe only thing that I really enjoyed about the game was the custom faction option. I had fun populating my map with Warhammer 40K and Mass Effect inspired races / factions. I played with my own custom made Kilrathi Empire faction. I had more fun creating factions than actually playing the game though.\n\nSo, no, on the whole, this game isn't worth 50$.","June 13, 2015","false","7.7"," 92 of 118 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","92","118","4","2"

That said it has been pretty stable for me.   (Four year old dell xps 8100 with 16gb and a 750 Ti video card).   At present the plan seems to be to a go for a final release in May.    There will be frequent patches before then and perhaps a beta 6 release (beta 5, with enormous additions, was released yesterday (Mar26).      If you don't like encountering bugs and reporting them to help the game, then wait for the release.   Of critical importance remaining is tuning the AI to be smarter and more aggressive, imo.\n\nThat said, with yesterday's release the game is really starting to take shape.   I played and enjoyed Galciv2 (for which, coincidentally, a community update is being finished at the same time).    But GC3, even a couple of releases ago, just looks so much better, and the game will optionally be so much bigger (largest size is "insane" and it is just that, largest number of factions...100!) with many more custom races allowed, more minor races and a much improved ship designer (which is a game in itself that one can get lost in).     Colonizing of planets is more tactical with the new adjacency bonuses and on planet resources.     The battle viewer will remain a strategic choice rather than a tactical  (one can organize one's fleet with different numbers and classes of ships, of which support ships are critical) but it also looks much  better than GC2.    You can change camera viewing angle during the battle.   Watch a 30 vs 30 ship battle, enough said (check stardock.com to see live stream game examples).   Then there are various galactic items like nebulae which restrict defence and accuracy as well as numerous strategic resouces to mine in addition to relics that give civilization wide benefits.  The ideology table gives some sharply different choices depending on whether you feel good, bad, or neutral.   Diplomacy is rapidly improving but has some way to go (as I said)  and will I think be a key to success in a big game.\n\nWell, I could to on and on.  I am a long term 4x player (started with civ 1 in the day) and my advice is that this game will give a 4x challenge that feels, looks, and plays much different from, say, Civ 5, but with the same next turn tension and the same scramble for multiple objectives that makes a 4x game enjoyable.\n\nUpdate May 13 (day before 1.0 release)\n\nI am updating this review because the official release is roughly 24 hours away, and because the numerous patches and updates since my original reviiew have changed the situation.  First, my comments about "glitches", at least for my system and experience, are, as I predicted they would be, largely history.  In fact, the improvement in the performance of the game is beyond what my expectations were.   For example, as of the original view my CPU was running in the low 70 C range, (which is not a problem, mind) but since Beta 6 it has been running in the mid-60s C, a surprising improvement.   As a second example, a typical issue I was having was freezing in the mid to late game.  I have not seen this whasoever for several weeks.   As two more examples, key issues were occassional battle viewer and invasion hang ups. These appear to also to now be completely solid.    Perhaps the biggest change, though, is the enormous increase in content, of which  I might mention the inclusion of custom classes, meaning that I can now create my own races with an enormouse range of choices for abilities and characteristics, or borrow other peoples' creations (which I have done), to  include in my games.  I can, and have, played against the Angry Joe Army.   I have about 30 available right now, all tested and working.\n\nI should add that this is important if one want to play on the "excessive" or "insane" size galaxies, so that there are sufficient factions to fill in the univierse.  Yes you can play with dozens of AI opponents and the game works.\n\nIn other words, as we count down to official release, my take is that things have progressed better that I predicted or expected.   I think that is important to mention.   And looking forward there is a schedule of a steady stream of patches, updates, expansions planned for GalCiv 3 over the ensuing months and years.\n\nI wish I could give 2 thumbs up.","March 27, 2015","true","093.6"," 57 of 66 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","57","66","0","2"

While I owned and played a good deal of GC1 and GC2 they were always so/so to me.  I enjoyed them and got my money out of them but they never really engaged me as much as I would like to have been able to say that they did.  GC3 so far is holding my fancy though pretty good.  It has some flaws, the AI like most 4X games sucks at diplomacy.  The biggest sell to me is the HUGE maps.  I like games that go into the 500-1000 turn range and this game has that in spades with the larger maps.\n\nThe game does suffer from some CTD (Crash To Desktop) from time to time but that is when I am on huge and larger maps, and it is somewhat expected with a new game.   The CTD haven't really hurt my progress as I save often but they could cause someone to be upset if they don't save enough.\n\nOne bad thing is that Stardock is clearly in the game for the long haul and has plans to release DLC and expansions regularly.  This is a plus and minus.  I like a steady stream of content but there are some things that I feel like were left out of the game just to be an easy sell later on like Spies and other races.   This isn't a huge deal though as I am a game collector and I don't mind decent DLC/expansions.  I spend a small fortune with games like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis IV so I am used to this sort of deal.  However if you want a full experience I would suggest waiting later and picking up the game in a few years (if you can wait that long) for a complete edition at a sale price.\n\nBut if you enjoy the genre and don't mind having to pay as you go for features to be added here and there the game is worth the money.","May 18, 2015","true","34.2"," 72 of 91 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","72","91","5","0"

Ship design: although I am to lazy to play the ship designer, I believe there are people out there having huge fun with it. and customize their ships to every little detail.\n3.

Techtree: You got "normal techs" everyone can search but you have "specializations" which you have to choose from three, and the other two you can not research but trade with other players. which make every gamerun somehow different. But unlike "Endless Space" you do not have race specific research.\n5. limited building lot on planet represent the quality of planet. on a "Paradise" planet you can build like 15 buildings and on a "barely habitable planet" only 4, sure terraforming can change it quite a bit, but not like other 4x games each terraforming research you do only let you terraform 1!!! tile (in the early-middlegame) and you have to research further terraforming research to convert more.\n6. adjacent effect of buildings: If you build more fabrics together, they get bigger bonuses and a embassy boost the market places around it. So you have to plan your buildings ahead and for example leave a space in the middle of a big industry complex for let we say a refinery or a power plant to hugely boost its output.\n7. last but not least the really special thing I realized: The spacestation: unlike other space 4x games, you customize your space station with modules and well a "ring" around it (just like DS9) the ring is limited to 1 per station and determine which additional modules you can further install into a station. For example you can not build a culture modul into a station with a mining ring. And not only are station used to protect your boarders, they give moderate bonuses to planets around as well.\n\nFrom my point of view, I have seen all these positive facts expect point 7. somewhere else, but it make sense to combine them, it make the gaming experience rich and complex. But now I have to talk about the negative facts:\n\n1. The game do not really feel finished, from my opinion it is a late beta version. the descriptions of technology you research is a total mess: everywhere you see like, "maintenance -10%" you think great, it gives you a flat bonus of 10% on every building. WRONG: you have to look carefully and read the flavor text of the tech to see, it's only specific to "commerce building" or "research building" and there are still bugs while the symbol of a bonus don't match it description. and there are thing like the technology "industrial specialization" which gives you "manufacturing cost -5%" and another "manufacturing cost -5%" so is it 10% or is it only 5% and there is a bug? And in general the game do not tell you in a intuitive way. For example, I still do not know how my raw production and raw manufacturing/research and net income is calculated. So 1 or 2 more months is needed to get rid of some of these and make other things clear I hope.\n2. "Planet potentials" you know your planet is class 16 with 16 tiles you can build on, but how far can it get? my capitol can only be terraformed to class 18 and another to class 24. So it's kind of a pocker, how good your planet can get.\n3. Terraforming: It is not really clear that there are different "terraformable tile quallity" -->  salvageable, decent, less, and almost useless quality. the tech "terraforming plant" f.e. can be used on salvageable and decent tile, but keep in mind, that in the late game you can terraform all salvageable tiles but only ONE!!! decent tile. So you will "waste" your "terraforming plant" if you use it inefficiently.\n4. No Espionage. What shall I say, I read about that GC2 had it and GC3 will get it per Addon...\n5. Culture/border/spacestation: If you are a highly cultural race, you will push the enemy border back and take over their planet, but not their spacestations, in fact AI stations will continue mining your precious resources and you can't do anything not even build your own one next to it or buy it from AI, you have to blow it up. And on top of that, AI at peach even build station actively in your territory, that make it more difficult to play cultural race.\n\nSo from my point of view, this game is really nice, but at the moment, things are still not final, that's why I do not recommend it to everyone interested. Wait a few month, there will be a discount on price and the game will be "hopefully" more finished.","May 17, 2015","false","76.4"," 111 of 153 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","111","153","2","1"

It's a for 4x space strategy game for the uninitiated, but much more than that for those familiar with its inner workings.  For one, you can custom design your own ships from the ground up as opposed to being restricted to certain designs.  "Galactic Civilizations III" dances to a familiar tune but introduces some new gameplay mechanics (like Ideology) that fans of "Sid Meier's Civilization V" will be familiar with (it's similar to culture).  Having played the Beta for some time (I managed to get early access), I'm pleased to report that it's shaping up to be everything I expected and more.\n\nWhile I explore this game more, feel free to check out an hour's worth of Beta footage via the below videos:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rt6sPzICbe8\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWHBpFJmya0","August 14, 2014","true","9.6"," 166 of 240 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","166","240","0","5"

I also wrote that I couldn't find political parties, but forgot that this came with a diplomatic research option in the previous games as well, so I am retracting that point too.\n\nAdding 2 more things I noticed after playing another 1.5 hours today, though.\n1. The zoom on the minimap seems to reset every turn, so you have to keep changing it to the scale you want.\n2. Money is not prominently displayed like it used to be, so financial decisions are a bit more of a pain to make.\n\nNone of the things I'm finding are gamebreaking, and I doubt that I will be posting any more of them here. The point I'm trying to make here is that there shouldn't BE all these little things in a finished product. They should have been caught and fixed in beta. To the individual who thinks I'm "an old guy"... don't really have an answer. I don't think I'm that old, and I invested hundreds of hours in GalCiv 1 and 2 when I was younger. That was something like 7 years ago.\n\nBut as for being stuck in another gaming era... perhaps. I remember how I felt when I played GalCiv 1, and what a huge improvement GalCiv 2 was at the time. I just don't feel that GalCiv 3 currently offers any major improvement on GalCiv 2, and it doesn't feel as polished as well.\n\nSorry?\n-----\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\n\nI'm a little disappointed, to be honest, that there don't seem to be many reviews that are completely honest about the state of the this game. I love Stardock and the GalCiv franchise, so this negative review is being written out of love, not spite. It isn't a bad game, but it certainly isn't yet what I'd term "ready for launch."\n\nI'll start with what I've noticed in the first couple hours of playing, so that anyone else who's thinking about shelling out $50 for the game has at least some idea of what's what.\n\n1. Battlecam is a mess. In the normal mode, ships eventually fly out of view of the camera during battles and you can't see what's going on. If you switch to free mode, the controls are so sensitive that the slightest touch will send the camera flying off into the far distance or way too close, making it impossible to see anything. It's very difficult to get the camera into just the right frame.\n2. Tutorial is not very thorough. I've played GalCiv I and II quite extensively, and there are a number of new features in this game which are not adequately explained in the tutorial, i.e. intricacies of adjacencies, behavior of ships in battle based on various stats, and more.\n3. No espionage. I heard this will be included later as DLC, but why are they going to be charging for something that was a feature in previous games?\n4. Units don't gain experience in battle anymore.\n5. AI frequently says inane things to you during the game. I had a computer that was "close" to me in diplomacy who nonetheless kept threatening me for no reason.\n6. Soundtrack is not seamless, with very noticeable pauses between switching tracks.\n7. From what I can tell, you can't concentrate production values on individual planets anymore to focus on military, research, or social production, nor can you adjust taxation level to help with morale. If I'm wrong about this, then that just goes to show that things are not well-explained in the game.\n8. No more asteroid mining to help with production.\n9. It seems like there's also no more political parties, meaning you can't be ousted from government. I'm not really sure what morale does, in this case. Either way, it makes the game less interesting.\n\nAnd a number of graphical stutters. I'm sure I'll find more issues as I continue to play--and I do intend to continue to play, and will update my review once I've had more time with it. I have a lot of love for this series, and I want it to succeed. I know from playing the previous games that Stardock will pour a lot of effort into making this the best game they can. However, I cannot honestly say that this game feels ready or polished and, in fact, it rather feels like a rehash of old territory, but with features taken away.\n\nI really hope they make significant progress. I want this to be the best GalCiv yet. It just isn't so far.","May 14, 2015","false","7.3"," 364 of 555 people (66%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","66","364","555","25","30"

This coupled with a developer with a proven reputation for supporting their games for a long time makes this a safe buy. Journalistic reviews are very favorable as well. If you are in for the long haul this game has amazing potential for the future, and unlike most other games in the genre recently has the financial means to deliver.\n\nBig Features\n-Fully 64bit & DirectX11: Perhaps the games most important feature, removing one of the genres biggest limitations: the 32bit 4gb memory limit. This allows the scale of the game to increase by a order of magnitude in terms of map size, amount of ships, planets and stars, and complexity of AI routines.\n\n-Adjacency on Planets: The way you place planetary improvements matters. If you put 2 improvements of the same category next to each other, they will buff eachother. Combined with terrain bonuses native to the planet and clever terraforming means you can get factories or research labs with 6+ bonus levels on your high quality planets quite easily, massively boosting your production.\n\n-Map Size: The largest map in civilzation: Beyond earth and Endless Legend are around 10.000 tiles[forums.civfanatics.com]. Galciv3's biggest map size is 432.061 tiles, appropriately named Insane. Keep in mind that a insane map requires at least 8gb ram to even start.\n\n-Campaign: A rarity in 4x games, this game offers a campaign. The main benefit this brings is that it allows newer players to jump straight into a game that in well in progress, giving them a chance to see the beauty of 4x games without having to struggle trough the learning curve to much, it starts of with a couple of large space battles to give players a taste of what is possible. A experienced 4x player can probably beat the campaign in one of two afternoons, while a new player might take a bit longer.\n\n-Ship Designer (cosmetic part): A iconic feature of the series, the in game ship designer is a powerful tool that lets you build virtually any ship you can imagine, such as ships form popular TV series.  Chances are you can see a bunch of them in the screenshot section. The game comes with a bunch of pre-made designs and workshop integration will allow for easy downloading of other players ships if designing ships isn't your thing.\n\n-Ship Designer (gameplay part): Choose the stats and combat roles of your ships. Research ship components like enginers, weapons, shields and life support, then put them on your ships to create your own style. build anything from large capital ships, carriers that launch strike craft, bombers and interceptors to freighter hulls loaded with lazers. Customize your ships to be optimal against the enemy you are fighting. You can assign your ship combat roles that determine how they behave in fleet combat (ie interceptor, support ship, assault ship, etc) This part too is not mandatory, the game will dynamically generate ships for you as you research more parts, those ships will do the job but might not be exactly what you want.\n\n-In Depth Faction Creator: upload your own pictures and icons (or videos) to use for your faction, choose what positive and/or negative traits your faction gets, your ship style and looks, UI color, tech tree, etc. Set up how the AI should play your race if you want to fight against it by giving it personality traits and priorities.\n\n-High moddability: The devs went out of their way to make this game easy to mod, allowing virtually every aspect of the game to be changed. In June steam workshop support will arrive, allowing for players to easily share their mods, custom factions, ship designs and components, custom maps, balance changes, etc.\n\nUsual 4x features\n-Large number of opponents: The game supports up to 128 AI opponents for truly insane games, where entire factions will die out before you even meet them.\n\n-Multiple Victory Conditions: Standard feature for any 4x worth it's salt.\n\n-Faction specific tech trees: The tech tree is large enough that in a regular game you will only research certain parts of your choosing form it. Each race has a couple of unique techs, and gets certain techs earlier then others, each tech tree has its own full set of flavor text per race. Specialization techs offer you a choice between 3 techs of which you can only choose one, though you can get the others trough trade if you want.\n\n-Ideology: Colonizing planets and galactic events present you with ethical choices allowing you to choose a benevolent, pragmatic or malevolent path. Each choice might have pros and cons for the planet you are colonizing, and gives you ideology points to spend on perks. The perks become quite powerful in the higher tiers and each path offers strong options.\n\n-Multiplayer: Play with friends and stuff. 4 player multiplayer atm. At the time of writing there are still some stability issues to work out but that is slated to be fixed within the next weeks.\n\n-Diplomacy and AI: Still a bit in it early shoes but is constantly being worked on. A common pitfall amongst 4x games is that this area lacks on launch, nevertheless the AI performs quite well compared to other games. The AI will regularly contact you with trade request, comment on your relationship (move ships out of my area, dont build up troops near my borders, your army is weak, i like that were trading, i dont like that your friends with the other guy, etc.). It's noteworthy that the AI doesn't cheat nearly as much as a lot of other games in the gerne, it can't see the entire map for example.\n\nFuture Support\n-Dev has stated multiple times that the life cycle of this game is around 7 years.\n\n-3 expansion packs and 12+ DLCs are sheduled. Expansions include major new game systems, DLC includes non-mandatory things like extra civilizations, custom scenarios (evil squirrels take over the galaxy scenario confirmed), ship parts, etc.\n\n-regular free content patches are planned during this period. This includes basic gameplay features like AI updates, Ui improvements, steam workshop/mod support, bug fixes, etc.\n\n-Features slated for expansions include: espionage, fleet commanders, hypergate long distance travel, increased starbase complexity (and hopefully starbase designer), increased diplomacy complexity, planets with population from multiple races. ofc no promises no official announcements have been made.\n\nInfo on Developer\n-Dev has a history of being nice to customers and supporting their games for a long time.\n\n-Dev is financially solvent and game was fully funded before development began, game is selling like hot cakes (100.000 units sold before launch, beat GTA V on top sellers list for two days after release), so there is no risk of the game being abandoned for financial reasons.\n\n-Dev communicates well with customers, there has been a dev stream[www.twitch.tv] every week for over a year before release, where they take questions from viewers. They are active on both the steam forums and their official forums. Even the CEO of the company has made multiple appearances on the stream.","May 16, 2015","true","108.4"," 83 of 112 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","83","112","5","1"

Some nice ideas, alright to brilliant visuals, nice tunes, OK diplo, etc. But the game design... dude... This is a nightmare. The kind that slowly, creepily, haunts you at night.\n\nSo for starters that game is ultra slow. If you like your 4x turns to take about 30s to 1min, then this game is alright. But if you want one full game to last less than 30hrs, then this game is NOT for you. Pacing is always a big issue in designing a 4x game (as Jon Shafer explained in a couple of great articles), and this game is proof. I remember ranting about Civ 5 taking too long to complete even on Fast setting, but this... See, at the time I'm writing this review, I'm clocking about 20hrs of game time. That's 1 tutorial and 2.5 campaign missions. Thing is : the tutorial took half of that.\n\nWhy this game is slooooow isn't a computing problem (I've got a nice machine, turn goes by without even noticing a slowdown, everything goes fast), it's a game design problem. The perfect recipe for a 4x game is when you have much things to deal with at each and every turn. Meaningful and interesting choices if possible (yes I'm talking to you Pandora). Is Galactic Civ III, turns went past me by the dozens just because everything is this game take 20-30 turns to happen. I soon realized that every single strategic choice I was making was to improve the rate at which things where building JUST to push the damn game forward! That wasn't a real strategic choice, that was just a comfort choice, so I could make something happen in the game under 6 hours.\n\nWhen you end up fighting the game rules to speed up things, something went wrong...\n\nFor instance : you have a build queue on every planet you have. Great. Alright. Buildings and ships are built that way. They all cost a certain amount of "Manufacture" (Prod) and conveniently, your planet generates "Manufacture". If a building needs 45Man and you produces 15Man a turn, it takes 3 turns to complete the building. Right?\nNow if you have three buildings that all cost 15 and you build them on a planet that produces 45 a turn, how much turn do you need to produce all three of them? One? WRONG. You need 3 turns. Because it doesn't push unused "Manufacture" to the following builds to the point it can build multiple things at the same turn. so even if you get a planet with 150Man a turn, and a bunch of buildings each costing around 45-60 Man, you will NEVER build more than 1 building per turn.\n\nSo a build queue that could have taken 3 turns, ends up taking 10-15 turns... for nothing!\n\nSo of course, every turn, you have something new to deal with : "Hey! here's a new building we could have built 6 turns earlier, we just wanted you to know we don't give a damn! And NO you don't have anything to do with it, this is just a message filling your log that you can't do much about!"\n\nSo much for a good 4x recipe...\n\nThat's just an example of how the game makes you go mad. Here are a few others :\n\n- Ships are put into Fleets, Fleets have a maximum size measured in "Logistics". Each ship in a fleet costs part of this "Logistics". You can have Logistics reduction on ships so that they end taking less room in the Fleet so that you can put more of them. The problem is that "Logistics"stat is stored in a decimal value (but displayed as a integer value). So you end up with Ships costing 1 Logistics that cannot join a Fleet of 28/29 Logistics... because ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\n- Some technologies (Specialisations) expect a choice from you. Most of them have 3 possible choices, mutually exclusive and definitive. Some of them won't go with your plan, some others will exactly fit your master plan. Turns out these techs are available for diplomatic trading, but since each Specialisation choice is a separate tech, you may end up earning a Tech that you didn't choose based on the fact it was a exclusive choice. Such technologies won't appear as "Specialisation" tech in the trading screen. Now you're stuck with the strategic choice of another civ... because ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\n- The Ship Designer is a complex and rich piece of software that lets you assemble, scale, rotate, fiddle with, even ANIMATE ship parts in a very, very, very profound way. You may end up spending countless hours designing splendid vessels to contemplate ingame. The same goes if you ever want to build a working useful ship. There is no "Just give me a ship with Defense AND Attack please" button. There is no "Just fit my ships with what they need, even if it's not perfectly optimized just build them" button. But there IS a core listing of ships that the game provides for starters... but these ships are only complete and in working order when you research some specific Technologies first. You can build them, fly with them, but they'll only be of any use if you get to those techs. But it WON'T TELL YOU WHICH ONES... because, again, ♥♥♥♥ you.\n\n- The planet screen lets you place buildings on its available tiles. The basic buildings all have multiple upgrade buildings (better versions of the latest) that you build on-top of them. At any given point, if you have the technology to build an upgrade version of an existing building on the map, it will show on the list of available buildings that you may place and build... but you can't place them anywhere you want because they only appear there so that you are reminded that some of you buildings may be upgraded (which is already the whole point of having a big "up arrow" on top of those buildings with an "Upgrade" button next to them). So it is just there to further dwell you into madness and anger... because ♥♥♥♥ ergonomy. Anyway, who cares about ease of use nowadays?!\n\n\nThis game is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to play. I needed this game to be great, so I kept playing, and playing until something happened to make me love it, but it kept striking me with stupid UI design, bad pacing job and worst game design flaws that absolutely forbid this game to earn its legacy's reputation.\n\nThis game doesn't need a patch, it needs to be remade correctly.","May 17, 2015","false","19.7"," 78 of 107 people (73%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","73","78","107","6","1"

Although the game officially isn't in early access beta any longer, there are still several bugs left to be fixed, multiple game balance changes are made in each patch, and miscellaneous other improvements are still being worked on besides those already implemented in the two first patches. The feeling one gets from all this is that this game hasn't reached gold quality yet, but that it'll happen in a few weeks or months. Several issues remain to fix, including fully implementing some features.\n\nGalactic Civilizations III is an ambitious update of the popular predecessor, Galactic Civilizations II, with numerous changes of the game mechanics, and a general improvement of the graphics, both of which take advantage of the possibilities that 64-bit operating systems provide. A consequence of this is that this version uses much more of the computer resources, such as CPU, RAM and GPU. Since the game isn't fully optimized yet, despite being sold as a finished game, there are some performance issues like lags and freezing, although the latest patch to version 1.02 seems to have brought several performance improvements.\n\nSome of the biggest changes are the upgraded ship editor and the new battle mechanics. The ship editor has become more advanced, with new functionality which makes it easier to create good-looking custom ships. The space battles are now more complex, with each ship having a designated tactical role which is selected when saving a new ship design.\n\nDiplomacy and espionage has been changed in several ways, but neither is fully implemented yet, so the current version is more limited than the previous version was at the end of its development.\n\nThe manual is still a work in progress, so reading the forums is sometimes necessary to find out how some aspects of the game work. Some features aren't yet fully implemented, so some frustration with strange behavior and even inability to continue playing in some situations have to be endured in the current condition. The developers are hard at work with patches, and an upgrade to version 1.1 is expected in the near future.\n\nMy overall impression at this moment in time is that this game is a promising 4X turn-based strategy space-themed game which currently can be viewed as a playable public beta. Recommended only if you want to start learning the game mechanics, and explore possible tactics and strategies, while waiting for all the features to become fully implemented, and if you can stand the various bugs and unfinished balancing of the game. It'll take some time to master all the aspects of this game, so playing it now can be considered as preparation for the real gold version in the near future. The developers listen to feedback, so posting in the Gameplay Feedback forum is recommended.","May 27, 2015","true","205.1"," 65 of 86 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","65","86","3","0"

I'm getting an issue where the whole screen just goes black except for the mouse cursor, and the music continues playing.

I would've held off on spending $50 if I had known that this many bugs were still present.\n\nedit: A few months on and I have to say I'm still disappointed.

The Drath were freaking cool too.) and the DLC has so far added...events, a goofy alien campaign (for a minor race no less), and well that's about it. I also have to say that I'm disappointed it only supports windows, with the Win10 debacle I've been moving towards linux slowly but surely and the lack of linux support is disheartening - especailly considering that linux is a huge force for 64-bit OSes. The game is by no means terrible, and it had big shoes to fill to begin with, but these things still stick in my mind.\n\nEDIT------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNow that a bit of time has passed, I though I should update this. Lots of bugs have been worked out, and the AI is finally up to par with the previous games in the series. I'm still disappointed by the lack of races - where are the Torians and the Arceans? I really wish the Drath and the Korx were still options to play as well. The DLC released so far is OK, but I'm going to wait for a sale since it doesn't really add anything that I'm dying to have in the game. If they were introducing new races (besides squirrels!) that would be awesome. Really my only complaint with the game is the lack of races. Right now, I would say if you really love this kind of game then buy it. If you want to ahve more races to play with/as, then I would wait for a sale. I would say that the game is worthwhile as long as they keep expanding it and adding new options.","May 17, 2015","false","121.9"," 68 of 91 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","68","91","2","1"

As in, EXTREMELY hard.  StarDock has done an excellent job with GC3.  That's not to say there still aren't quibbles over the direction certain features have taken, but the reality is, that if you actually want to release a game, certain decisions are going to have to be taken, and you're sure to ♥♥♥♥ off someone who wanted that feature and didn't get it.  But GC3 is a solid and entertaining game, if not a radically innovative one.\n\nOn to the specifics:\n\nA big positive is a revamp of the "alignment" system from GC2, which was, frankly, pretty primitive. The new one is far more nuanced, and continues to be relevant through the entire game.\n\nThe game has changed from square-based to hex-based, and whether or not you love it or not often boils down to whether you used to be a paper boardgame player. I for one much perfer it to squares.  Movement and area of influence or effects are much smoother and visually linear.\n\nYou'll note that the game is 64-bit only. There's a reason for this: GIANT MAPS.  This is a highly-threaded, fast game engine, and high-end gaming boxes can play on a map of 1000+ planets and 50+ opponents.  Turn times are reasonable at this point, but you still want a darned powerful box if you're playing on these ginormous box.  It plays nice and smooth on a typical i5 with 8GB with modest graphics card, against 10 computer opponents on a 50+ star map, and there aren't any noticeable bugs at this point; it certainly is stable and non-crashing.   My rig is high-end (8-core Xeon & 24GB of RAM, with SSDs and a Nvidia 750), and I have absolutely no problems at all on my 200-star maps and 25 opponent games.\n\nThe planet improvement scheme is VERY much improved by adjacency bonus; it now matter as much as to HOW you place your buildings on a planet as which ones you build.  And, speaking of buildings, there's easily twice as many different ones to choose from, and three times as many "bonus" tile times.  The AI generating the tiles still needs a bit of tweaking to avoid some stupid layouts, but that's a minor quibble, and likely will be improved more via free updates.\n\nThe ship builder is more complex, and much more interesting to use. Ships now have a wider choice of weapons (including chosing between ones with different ranges, rates of fire, etc.), and larger engine selection. Unfortunately, I find it a bit clunkier than the GC2 one.\n\nThe Battleviewer is pretty much unchanged since GC2.  The promised tactical settings (i.e. "offensive", "defensive" for your fleet tactics) has yet to materialize.  Probably won't until later this year, and either an Expansion Pack or DLC.   There will be no Tactical Combat player screen. I'm very happy about that (I don't want TBTC in my 4x), but some others feel it should be there.\n\nThe Graphics are excellent for a 4X.  Personally, I think they're just right - nice, without being over the top and loading my system down with work for something that's really not gameplay-relevant.\n\nThe tech trees are custom to each race, and noticeably (if not entirely) different. A new feature is exclusive choice in some techs:  some technologies have 2 or 3 sub-techs in them, and you can only chose one.  This means you can't just load up on the entire tech tree, but have to be careful about how you pick your path through it, because certain choices simply will exclude you from possessing others.\n\nDiplomacy and the United Planets are greatly improved over GC2 - far more meaningful interactions, and many of the "cheats" and such possible in GC2 have been either closed off, or are actively penalized.  Being diplomatic is just as important as being militarily strong.\n\nTrading and the Economy are better overall than GC2, but require a bit too much micromanagement at this point. If anything, I hope this will be further improved by a post-release patch.  It's certainly playable now, just it gets hard when you move up to the really big maps (managing 5 dozen planets can get a bit tedious right now).\n\nEspionage IS NOT included in the initial release. StarDock has said it will be in the first major Expansion Pack, as they want to make a considerable effort to radically improve it over GC2.  So don't expect this until 2016 sometime.\n\nFinally, the A.I. is solid, but rather bland at this point. However, there is a saving grace:  this is a learning A.I.  StarDock has hooked it into SteamWorks, and will be datamining all user strategies to improve the A.I. performance, and will be updating the A.I. regularly when you sign into Steam.  So, as the GC3 community gets better, so will the A.I.\n\n\n\nOverall, solid 8 out of 10 for the intial Release.\n\n\nAlso, note that StarDock has explicitly committed to several "substantial" DLCs per year (read: things that actually improve gameplay, not just skins or bling, but stuff like more races, new ship flavors, etc.) and at least 3 major Expansion packs over the 6-7 year lifespan. Given there track record, I fully expect that these DLCs and Expansion Packs will take the entire game in new directions, and make a very substantial impact on keeping the game relevant over time.\n\nI fully expect that GC3 will graduate to a 9.5 star game over the next couple of years, and, given StarDock's track record of listening to its customers, much of the direction of GC3's improvement is going to be up to the community.","May 12, 2015","true","055.3"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","40","46","0","0"

Some times you were happy to play a half hour at a time. The fan base for this game though is such that it is develouping faster than I expected. Mostly due to the fact that this is one of the devs flagship games and they take the fans serious.\n\nThe game is very much what you would expect from the series. I was hopingg the dread lords would become a playable character with a new uber antagonist replacing them, its still in develoupment though so crossing my fingers. All the origonal playable characters are still there (Currently still 2 to be released). They all now "feel" like self realised races though and not just stat bonuses and a spattering of race only techs.\n\nAlot of the reviews in the negatives for this game was for the fact that they put it up for sale not long after the release. A fact that has nothing to do with the game and is all about the customer. Its a shame really how hurt this games reviews are due to that.\n\nSo here I am 7  months into the game develoupment now. Paided full price, was not upset about the sale as I being a reasoned adult know that means more people on the game helping the DEV's. From what I seen so far I give 4.5 out of 5.

These and other missing aspects of any decent 4X game will be sold at a later date in expansions.  In the end, this game will cost you over $100 just to get what it should have in the base product.  I do not like this trend in some games we are seeing, where an incomplete game is sold for full price as though it were a finished product, and then over the next months and years, the game is finished and released at extra cost.\n\nSecondly, this game is not a third installment, but more like a 2.5 installment.  If you played GC2, you have already played this game.  Almost everything is exactly the same as its predecessor.  Once more, planets have no moons we can exploit, dead planets cannot be mined or otherwise used, black holes and nebulas, are little more than space walls that impede traffic (apparently in space, there is no 3D travel allowing us to fly under or over these obstacles), asteroids belts cannot be mined, either.\n\nPlanet development is the same as GC2, with random tiles conferring random bonuses.  There are no telescopes in this game, so we cannot know what the universe looks like, what planets are like, what stars have planets, etc. until our scout ship (or some other vessel) goes there.\n\nThe races are generic and dull.  Apparently, in the galaxy all races breath the same air as we do here on earth, prefer the same atmosphere and climate, and want the same gravity.  The race creator is as uninspired as the races themselves, being a rather shallow system where you get to pick from a handful of options to create a not all that unique race.  There is no high gravity races or worlds, no aquatic races, no radiation races, nor anything else unique.  The races are more like different groups of humans than species who have evolved on different worlds, except for the fact that they look rather alien (mostly).  Think of the races as humans, and humans wearing costumes.\n\nThe tech tree is as imaginative as the races.  Generic is the word to use here.  None of the tech is interesting.  There are no fascinating tools like shields that extend over other ships in your fleet for instance.  Just a series of faster engines, a series of stronger missiles and bullets and lasers.  You can unlock more squares on your planet, you can get some terraforming so you can live on cold or hot planets...basically, this is the same generic tech tree in every 4X game in the past 7 or 8 years.  There is nothing interesting here, but there are silly fluff techs you need to research in order to discover that you need to research weapons, or engines, and so on.  Even with the fluff techs, the tech tree is so short, that you easily cap out your research.  In order to slow down players' research, there is an age system.  There are three ages, and during each age, you can only research so far up the tech tree.  Why?  Because, that's why.  We don't want players researching too quickly, the AI opponents will feel sad, I guess.\n\nTrade is conducted the same way as in GC2.  In this game, you can send constructors to build starbases that mine special minerals and such floating in space.  These can be magically shipped at great distances to your planets, even passing through alien, even enemy, territory at no extra cost.  Pirates do not interfere with your shipping of these valuable resources, nor do other factions.  the only way to impede this magic transport of rare resources is to destroy the miner base.  Not capture it, no, just destroy it.\n\nThere are a couple things Stardock did improve on, however.  The lousy morality system in GC2 that never even worked all that well, was changed to an ideology system.  The same three morality perspectives--benevolent, pragmatic, malevolent--still apply, but as you acquire more points in these ideologies, you can unlock the ideology tech tree.  The ideology tech tree is more interesting than the regular tech tree, but it is very small, and somewhat redundant across the systems.  There are some variants and interesting things in it, though, and this is easily the only part of this game that is actually any good.\n\nThe other improvement, which is a bit of a mess as implemented, is adjacency bonuses on planets.  Various structures can provide bonuses if they are built next to each other.  Also, certain random bonus tiles on the planets can provide bonuses as well.  This is a mixed bag because the tiles are random, and you will often find yourself unable to take advantage of certain bonuses, or set up a grouping of buildings that feed bonuses to one another.\n\nThe other attempted improvement is the creation of unique tech trees for the races.  Unfortunately, the tech trees are so generic, that the differences are extremely small and not worth mentioning.\n\nIn short, this game is just GC 2.5, but without espionage or politics.  I can only recommend waiting for two years, maybe three, for expansion packs to flesh out this incomplete offering, and get released in some kind of deluxe edition for a reasonable price.  However, I am confident that no expansions will solve this game's greatest drawback:  genericness.  This game is generic mediocre gaming, and it shows in every aspect.  There is nothing innovative or interesting when exploring or colonizing.  Combat is abstracted and forgettable, just as it was in GC2.  Techs are the same, races are humans in costumes, and so on.  Save your money and don't waste your time.  Just load up GC2.\n\n","May 17, 2015","false","30.4"," 74 of 107 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","74","107","4","3"

It is much improved over GC II. This is a turn based strategy game.\n\nRaces\nFirst, you can create a custom race anyway way you want to. Steam Workshop has some cool factions for the pictures and you can customize those as well.\n\nThere are several races in the game. Typical humans, of course, an evil race called the Drengin, and others. I think the background diversity of the races is really neat. The Yor are metaloids with no morals = not evil, just amoral. The Krynn Syndicate are composed of minor races, and the Altarian Resistance is the do-goody cute girl leader. There are other major races as well.\n\nThe minor races are also neat. They do not expand but make good trading partners. Their worlds are also big if you want to conquer them.\n\nEconomy\nVery nice. Each planet based on size has tiles to build improvements. These give small bonuses initially but add up with all of the other bonuses and make a good difference. I usally make most worlds finance so I can rush produce items and have a large fleet. Terrforming is one tile at atime which cuts down on management.\n\nResearch\nI am impressed with the research trees in this game. There are slightly different trees for each race. I like the fact that there are many non-military technolgies as well as a large amount of military upgrades.\n\nStar Bases\nThese make a big difference. Powerful in the early going they become obsolete fast against dedicated enemy fleets. However, Star Bases and planets can have up to 60 points of ships stationed there right from the beginning. The key for star bases is that they have many upgrades for economies. Small increases add up. Up to 4 (sometimes 5) star bases can surround a planet and with all the upgrades the bases will increase the planet economy 200% (so you are getting triple the base). This stacks on the planetary improvements as well. And, there are different types of star bases = economy, military, mining and culture.\n\nPrecursor Artifacts\nThe Precursors inhabited the Galaxy long ago but disappeared. They left behind some goodies. WIth a Star Base you can claim these artifacts and they give bonuses to the whole empire.\n\nCombat\nThis is played out in real time. I like it. There are lots of sounds and shots and explosions. This is very cool. The role of a ship (selected when saving the design) determines where the ship is at battle's start. There are even fighter pods for the ships once researched. I really like the combat in this game.\n\nPlanetary combat is just one screen and no action. You select your attack type and get the results. Different attacks are researchable.\n\nThe Music is very good.

I hated seeing this. I understand it's in Beta, but the only options for you right now are to start a new game or start a quick game. Everything else is blocked off. I haven't played multiplayer so I'm not sure how well that works. I'm not too upset given I spent $25 on the game, but for those who fully supported Stardock back in GC3's $100 asking price I feel right now you aren't getting your money's worth.\n\nSecond thing I noticed: Holy hell this game is beautiful. Seriously, every event that you have to make a decision on has its own piece of art to look at in the background. It sort of looks like concept art, and it's extremely well done and I enjoyed every event because each one had its own art to see. The graphics are nice, a huge step up from GC2, and understandably so. It has more of a hex-based system of movement that was present in GC2 but it's emphasized more in this game.\n\nMusic: Great as always. It sounds pretty much like a Galactic Civilizations game. If you liked the soft, ambient music of GC2 (at least during peaceful times) then you'll enjoy it in this one.\n\nGameplay: Not fully fleshed out, as I'll get to soon, but for the most part the features that are more developed are amazing. The tech tree is massive and overwhelming at first, but with time you'll figure out which techs to rush first and optimize properly. The overall consensus is that ship building is fun, but in my brief period of playing I didn't get around to it. Planning on building placement in planets is pretty much the same as GC2, I'm pretty sure all buildings from both the base game and expansions from GC2 are available in GC3 along with a plethora of other buildings I didn't see.\n\nChanges in the way fleet management and production was interesting and something I had to get used to first due to my extensive time spent in GC2. Instead of building a Starport on your planets to make them able to build ships, you have to produce a Shipyard which you build just like a Starbase, which has its pros and cons such as not taking up a slot on your planets, but being able to be destroyed by enemies.\n\nSo far I feel income management isn't fully developed. When you look at your income all it tells you is how much you're making. I think there might be an option to change how much you focus your spending, but it was a little finicky to get to work, at least in my inexperienced eyes.\n\nWars aren't done yet. The battles are close to GC2, but when I got invaded, all that happened was a pop up saying "You're being invaded" and I clicked OK and my planet was gone. Ship battles are nearly done, though overall battle is a little barren. This is probably one of the bigger deciding factors in buying the game since battle is one of the X's in 4X.\n\nThe tech tree is absolutely impressive. There's sooo many things for you to research that it overwhelmed me at the start. I didn't know where to begin. I think one of the main problems was I wasn't used to how the game ran so I was always at a loss to what I needed to research next, like should I focus on planetary improvements or focus on military or focus on expansion? I was randomly researching a little bit of everything until the Drengin Empire declared war on me and subsequently stomped me.\n\nSo the ending question is "Should I buy this game?" And I think the answer is yes. The developers seem very passionate about making this the best Galactic Civilization game thus far, and I believe that with time it will be.\n\nBut there's one more question: "Should I play this game right now?" And I would have to say no. I say pick this game up when it's on sale (like it is right now) or if you're willing to spend the $40ish dollars on it because the full release of the game looks extremely promising. BUT, I would also say that if you want to experience Galactic Civilizations in all its glory, buy and play GC2 Ultimate Edition until GC3 is more fully developed.","February 27, 2015","true","35.1"," 39 of 49 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","39","49","0","0"

The same graphics, icons, portraits, civilizations, technologies, buildings' names. There are a few new technologies, buildings, ship modules and a new ship creator, but overall it is still the same game - all basic functionality did not change: you can survey anomalies, build starbases, build buildings on planets in exactly the same way. If you want a few extras for Gal Civ 2 you may like this game, but if you got bored with Gal Civ 2 and expect something new - you will be disappointed.\n\nThere are multiple bugs:- SAVING GAME IS OFTEN UNSUCCESSFUL - game crashes when trying to load certain saves. This prevents you from interrupting the game because you never know whether you will be able to load that saved game or not, which in turn makes a game unplayable\n- you can sometimes build unique buildings twice\n- sometimes the technology tree shows that the technology was not yet discovered even though it was, you have to close and open technology tree again\n- the technology tree doesn't show descriptions of other specializations than the one you researched (specialization is a technology such that you have to choose one of 3 available, however you can buy the other two from other races)\n- bugs/mismatches between technologies' descriptions and actual effects\n- AI is pretty dump, they will declare the war against you because they don't like you, but will ask for peace next turn because you are too strong\n- path finding is dump, it will often choose a path through enemy teritory even though equally long path through your teritory exists\n- impossible to rename the planet immediatelly after colonising it, you have to go to the map and back to the planet\n- if there are multiple messages after others turn (war declared, new race found, auto-surveying ship found an anomaly) only one of them is shown\n- when you change production distribution (research/manufacturing/economy) the buildings queue is not refreshed, you have to either change something in the queue or switch to map/another planet and then come back\n- multiple typos in technology tree\n- various graphical bugs (shots not displayed correctly, some weird textures behind some of the texts etc.)\n- ideology traits saying that they give you some bonus which in fact is not applied at all\n- on larger maps the performance is really terrible, when you scroll the map you have to wait for a few seconds for it to load, opening any other view such as planet management or diplomacy also takes 5-10 seconds, a "quick battle" actually takes about 10 seconds of ships waiting on the map before one of them shoots and the other is destroyed; if you try to zoom in (to see actual models of entities instead of their icons) you will probably decide to zoom out again after 20 seconds of game being stuck\n\nAnd multiple annoying "features":- you cannot see the path or the range of the ship, click will initiate movement which cannot be interrupted\n- if a ship is moving towards destination and you press "next turn" button, the ship will move but all remaining movement points are lost, you are not promted to do something with the idle ship\n- the same happens if the ship is set to "automatic survey", once it reaches a destination anomaly site, all remaining movement points are lost\n- it is very difficult to control enemy ships movements - all are done at once and there is no log or "enemy turn replay"\n- all remaining manufacturing/research points are lost at the end of turn so if you have 2k manufacturing points per turn and want to produce a frigate which costs 200 points, you can only produce one per turn anyway\n- you can assign multiple planets to provide their manufacturing points to single shipyard, however you cannot assign single planet to multiple shipyards\n- buying ships/buildings ceases the normal production, i.e. if building A has 1 turn remaining and you buy building B, next turn building A will still have 1 turn remaining\n- although in ship designer there are tabs for "core" and "user" ships, there are no such tabs when upgrading existing ship, which means that you have to scroll through 20 "core" designs to find the one you made\n- micromanagement - each planet's potential can be split between wealth, manufacturing and research (defaults to 33% each). Let's say that you want a research focused planet so you set research to 100%. Once you discover a new type of laboratory, the upgrades will be put onto the building queue automatically, however they will not build because you have 0% manufacturing. On the other hand, if you have 20% manufacturing only for this purpose, once all laboratories are upgraded and building queue is empty, you just lose 20% of planet's potential\n- there are list to view all your planets/ships/starbases but the order in them is completely random with no sorting options\n- music is different in every view (map/ship/planet/governing planet/menu) which gets pretty annoying e.g. when you need to go over 20 ships to upgrade them and you hear 3 first seconds of two different tracks over and over again...\n\nEDIT: There is a beta patch availablehttp://forums.galciv3.com/467453/page/1 however it DOES NOT address any issues listed above... Stardock is promising regular extra content with the first expansion at the end of summer, however the game is so full of bugs that it is really unplayable.

Best thing is to go 64bit, so there is plenty room for an upgrade.\n\n...and upgrade is badly needed, btw.\n\nGame is playable, but sometimes still feels like a beta which was released way too early, while all buyers are getting used as semi-proffessional-testers. There is so much to do, that you have enough fun to explore all aspects of this game. They had some rather good ideas...unfortunately they didn't follow the road to the end.\n\nAs in shipyards. You could sink hours into building your own custom designed ships....but you can't lead them in a battle. All you could do is to have higher numbers then your enemy and wish good luck. They brought in a cinema like view on the 'battle'...but you could do NOTHING to change the outcome.\n\nAs for multiplayer. They totally forgot about founding different versions by simply translating the game without compensation. Us players had to bring voice toward the devs about their hard to stand mistake. About half a year the game wasn't playable in multiplayer. Lately us players found the missing key inside english localization files. But...at the end game is still not working in multiplayer...not for technical issue, but for bad design. All players are in LOCAL lobby to find mutliplayer games. If your local area has no GC3 players, you paid for a multiplayer game which you can't use. There is another bad design....they sold the game on GOG, but GOG players' versions are not compatible with STEAM players' version. They even didn't bring up a simple IP-connection...for their own reasons. Looks like GC3's multiplayer was just announced to have it but never implemented for internet users. Just a word: if I would like to play multiplayer with my neighbour I would have bought a tabletop. Multiplayer is used to be played worldwide not local.\n\nAs for creating your own custom faction. Factions aren't anything other then branches from only one alien race. All do compete on the same ressources, all do compete on the same sort of planets. All 'aliens' do start on little sunshine world same as all other. Devs changed the way those custom factions were stored several times...but you could never find out which one use old (=obsolete and gamebraking) design when you subscribe one from workshop.\n\nAs for Steam cloud. GC3 offers steam cloud for savegames, custom factions and your very own ship designs. Unfortunately it's simply impossible to delete them. Even Steam is not able to delete them completely. But if you have saves from earlier game versions...it is able to break your game. Instead of offering a simple switch to turn Steam cloud on/off for GC3 they just tell you to switch off Steam cloud for your entire account to avoid issues with GC3.\n\nAs for diplomacy. It's there...rudimentary, but it's like living in the '60 where all things are good or bad but game shows no offer for playing it other then by force. Still you can't prevent aliens from spreading colonies or outposts...even within your own zone of control. Player is still forced to run and hestitate to get some of the planets and goods before the aliens grab it.\n\nMy first guess is, the devs cutted out deeply needed parts to sell it later for good money as DLC. Worst of all decissions in my eyes. First one has to bring a totally satisfying game, then one could upgrade his good product with more flavor. Stardock may learn it from Paradox...\n\nI'm really dissappointed about the game in current state and also frustrated about it for a very long time, where no one was able to adress multiplayer issues for longer then half a year. It has great potential to be better then the actual design...but I fear the devs are a) unwilling or b) unable to do better.\n\nHave to adress my good impression about Stardock's helpdesk, those guys really try to fix issues...but unfortunately they can't adress bad design from devs. Yeah, one could say it's all merchandizing...but if I stop to buy things from Stardock, they defenetly regret. Seems there is no other way to get the message through.\n\nBesides there are allready competitors underway which avoid those issues.\n\nHave a look at 'Stellaris', 'Endless Space 2' or even new 'Master of Orion'....all announced 2016.\n\n\n","December 9, 2015","false","326.9"," 74 of 108 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","74","108","4","69"

The game is quite a bit earlier in the developement cycle than I had thought. Advancement is slow with some updates being made every 30 or 40 days. To say that the game is currently "playable" is a large stretch with very few game types functional and very few races available but there is no way to actually finish a game presently. The ship designer kind of works, and you can research stuff (well, you can pick stuff), but there is no combat at the moment.\n\nI wouldn't drop this kind of money on an unfinished product again. I know these guys will finish this and do damned good job, but it is too much money for a game that is a long way off with too many things that can happen between now and then. I'm also a little angry because it is totally diminishing my anticipation of the finished game when it releases.

There's a chance that you will need all computer power in the world to calculate AI turns if you're playing on biggest map option several days in, but space emperors must be patient, for there's whole hexagonal galaxy to explore! Full of intelligent lumps of Christmas lights and bloodthirsty Space Squirrels, of course.\nJust keep an eye over your survey ship, if it's brave captain decides to SURVEY A MOTHERFLIPPING WORMHOLE, it will take years for this ship to get back, their families will be long dead by that time and, most importantly, you will play through early game without anomaly bonuses.\n\nEver had a feeling that you will only play ONE MORE TURN before going to sleep? And then you realize you grew a beard and missed your daughter's funeral? That's exactly what's gonna happen if you get too sloppy! In Galactic Civilizations 2 i played until  there would be either too much fleets to control every turn without overloading my brain or until i run out of RAM and won't be able to save anymore. It may be VERY specific kind of fun for VERY special autists players, but it's basically like Pringle's: you'll eat all of them even if you have whole warehouse full of these lumps of cancer.\n\nThere's traditionally not much fun in war and invasion, mainly because instead of controlling ships directly (god, i miss hijacking Antares ships in Orion 2 so much) we're getting pew-pew-laserbeams-sound-in-space-flying-bricks viewer, and so far it seems to miss really fun mathematics Endless Space had in that field (meaning a solid bunch of ship builds and fleet combinations to play around in multiplayer), but even if war mechanics aren't really top notch, AI in this game, that is probably much smarter than general public of this greenish-blue ball we live on, won't let you get bored.\n\nOne of the trademarks of Galactic Civilizations series is that AI is a DIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIICK. On high enough difficulties they will try to turn absolutely any situation to their advantage. In previous game you could've spend weeks to annihilate powerful enemy which will later surrender to even more powerful enemy, giving them all their remaining worlds just to troll you (you can, of course, abuse savescam if it made you mad enough). Or long term ally will gradually build colonies around you to protect you from common enemy, and then they will ally to crush you because you had too much ascension crystals. On top difficulties you basically have no choice than abuse known loops in game mechanics to win. It will take time to understand how the whole deal works in long multiplayer matches, game after game of course, but it seems that there's not much diversity of playstyles to exist, even with multiple victory conditions.\n\nOverall improvements in planetary and empire management seems to be really solid, but adding connection bonuses to buildings without option to choose initial colony building seems strange. I can't also find tax slider anywhere. Well, Stardock promised to polish things and add stuff even after release, so they will probably tweak minor gameplay inconsistencies.\nI personally liked shipyards in space VERY MUCH.\n\nI still didn't fully dig enough into all mechanics and, frankly, didn't reach actual lategame there, which always turns into hell incarnate at some point, but so far, i give this game 50 000 shades of infrared out of 50 000.\n\nI miss helicopter jokes from old science robot tho.","May 14, 2015","true","65.2"," 71 of 104 people (68%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","68","71","104","56","0"

Pretty irritating since this one is still not finished a year later.\n\n\nUPDATE AS OF NOV:  I am upset that the game is on sale 50% on the  Stardock website with no mention of it being a beta.  I paid $45 for what was an alpha and now they are selling it for $22 -- and the game still doesn't even have combat.\n\nThe only rationale for this I can think of for this is that they expect the game will suck when completed and want to sell as much as possible now.\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW:\n\nI do believe this game WILL earn a recommendation, and therefore I am cautiously assigning it now.\n\nBUT BE WARNED: as of October this is more of an Alpha than a Beta.

Then I find out could preorder the Elite Founders Package and get all future content for $99. It took me all of about 3 seconds to log in and buy Gal Civ3. I have been playing a few games a week since. I will admit I played more GalCiv2 than GalCiv3 in Alpha, but I have not even played GalCiv2 in about 2 months.\n\nGalCiv3 is shaping up to be the best space 4X game that has ever been made. The game is about to be released and most all the major CTD or game stopping bugs have been fixed. Now I find myself playing a game as often as I can with several over the weekends.\n\nHere is what I love about the game: (I have about 350 hrs of game play atm)\n-Graphics- Brilliant!!!\n-Maps-\nHuge maps up to 5 times the size of GalCiv2, but I mainly play on Huge.\n-Anomalies-\nI love getting anomalies with my flagship. I really like atm you can buy the other races flagships to hunt even more anomalies. I am sure this will get fixed soon thou. Also I hope they add back the color system of the anomalies from GalCiv2. I hate clicking on a wormhole until all the good anomalies are gone from my area.\n-Pirates-\nIt will be nice when Stardock upgrades them to be more like Sins. I would love to pay or give ships to the pirates to attack random AI players. Paul said there is more planned options but for a latter DLC.\n-Adjacency system-\nBasically you have to place like buildings near each other to boost the value. Also with this new system there are lots of building types and not all races have the same buildings.\n-Terraforming-\nThere are lots of terraforming options. Now when you look at the planet management screen you see a map with land masses. Pretty much every hex you see that is on land you will eventually be able to terraform it. Oh how I miss the galactic wonder to auto update all tiles from GalCiv2.\n-Tech Trees-\nEach race has its own tech tree. Each tree has 4 areas (Colonization, Engineering, Warfare, and Governance) that are spaced out over 3 ages. A player has to think about what to upgrade now vs just getting to the best weapon/def combo and kill everything.\n-Starbases-\nI love building these. I swear I build a neutral zone with one of these every few inches on my boarders. The same bases are back and we get a new one, Mining. Now there are tradable resources to mine for new buildings, weapons, and ship support systems. I will admit I cannot wait until there is an auto build click option for upgrading Starbases. I swear I spent most my time sending constructors to Starbases. At least this time you can have more than one module on a constructor.\n-Shipyards-\nThis go around not every planet can make a ship. At first I hated this. Now with having a shipyard being sponsored with up to 5 planets you can manage you ship building much more easily. Plus with a great planet set up you can build huge ships in just a few turns.\n-Battle viewer-\nWatching your ships in action is great the first few times in a game. Then after you have 20+ battles a turn you are happy Stardock left in the old auto resolve option. I hope they add a click option to always auto resolve. I will turn in on after I have 5+ fleets in action.\n-Shipbuilding-\nThis time around the default ships are not that bad…Still mine are way better…\n-Fleets-\nThis time around you cannot just spam build one type of ship. You need assault ships, escorts for your larger ships, guardian ships for your carriers. YES we have carriers this time and they are currently very OP. They start each battle with a number of drone ships loaded up with your best tech to kill all aliens in your path.\n-Custom races-\nThis just got put in and I love it. I am making races left and right. The default ones are pretty easy to beat. I need more options: logos, pictures, backgrounds, etc… I keep hearing Paul talk about Jennifer, I think that is her name, and how she is god’s gift to coding most of all the goodies in the game along with the UI.\n-Ideological Traits-\nBasically your good, evil, neutral options. This time your actions take one of 3 paths which give points to buy traits in one of the three trees. You can stay in one tree or spread them out over all of them. Down side is the more you buy the more it costs. So maxing out all the trees is pretty impossible now. I only can pick about 20% of 1 tree now. The points are still under progress I am sure they will change upward soon.\n\nThings I know will get fixed and I am holding my breath waiting\n-AI-\nOne of the things I loved about GalCiv2 was the AI. GalCiv2 has 12 levels of difficulty and I have only been able to win on level 9 and that is only about 25% of the time. I think one of my best memories of the AI in GalCiv2 was when I was building up my fleets near the neutral zone getting ready to invade when the AI contacts me. I get a message that he has seen me do this before and he attacks me before I am ready and the game was over. Currently I am unable to lose on GalCiv3 the AI just is unable to anticipate my game play or put up much of a challenge. This is not to say it will be that way for everyone. I do have a million or more game plays since 2003. Brad will fix this. He likes it when the AI beats up on players…..\n-Diplomacy-\nI love the current UI, the concept, and all the options. The only problem is the AI does not value things the way a player does..YET! Devs read the forums every day and update the AI based on player’s feedback. Although it is pretty fun to sell things I never need to the AI for items they need but think they are better suited in my hands….ha-ha\n-Control N-\nI think I miss this option more than any other option from GalCiv2. If you do not know that is how you can restart a game once you have loaded up a map if you do not like what you see. Also works anytime in the game.\n-Ship Builder-\nBetter UI management and easy way to sort ships you want to use. In GalCiv2 it was easy to only have a few ships at a time in your window to choose from, here not so much.\n-Steam workshop support-\nI cannot wait to see what the players come up for mods to play with this game. I also hate building ships but love downloading great ship builder’s designs to use in my games….\n\nI hope this review helps…","May 2, 2015","true","174.7"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","27","32","0","1"

With this in mind I was able to load it up for the first time and jump straight into game play without much of a learning curve. It reminds me so much of what I liked about the games of yesterday.\n\nThere are nicely renedered cutscenes which lends to the overall grand scale atmosphere of the game. Animations are smooth and the units are clear and easy to distinguish fom each other.\n\nThere is a custom ship design screen where you can change the appearance of the ship. A vast tech tree to climb, and for those who like to micromanage planetary economics it offers enough control that you may do so.\n\nLastly of course this game is still in development and has much room for improvement, with that said for a beta it is relativly complete but not without its issues.

As many are saying there are a lot of features that seem unfinshed and many of the tech tree options are still unfinished preventing some aspects of the game from being fully reailzed. I would consider it Beta not Alpha because you can play the game to learn the basics and there are many techs to explore. The ai can also easliy beat you if you make mistakes in choices.\n\nI would say the early price was a bit high but again I purchased it at a slight discount.\n\nOne of the things that really affects your game overall is something I noticed in the last couple of games.  The ships do not always move every turn while I am sure the ai ships do every turn. I have noticed that at times if you do not monitor and move some ships manually they will not move every turn on a pretedermined path set by you.\n\nAs well unless I missed it there needs to be some sort of notification when a construction vessel arrives at a starbase.  I may have missed the quick way to check it but on a huge map tracking every ship and having to check every starbase for potential upgrades gets annoying.\n\nThe ship movement issue is not a Gal Civ issue alone. There are other games that I own that have similar issues but use different game engines.  Hopefully it will be resolved.\n\nOverall I would say it is a worthwhile game that looks just like Gal Civ 2 with added features that in time if the MP works well will make this a game worth having.\n","November 15, 2014","true","205.5"," 33 of 43 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","33","43","0","4"

They provide weekly Dev Streams where the lead designer demonstrates the capabilities of the game, explains their development intentions, and answers questions from the audience. Copies of the Dev Streams are available for viewing on YouTube.\n\nSo far, I have submitted over 24 bug reports and Stardock support has been very quick to respond to each of them. Most of the issues I raised have already been resolved via game updates or hotfixes.\n\nThe game is 64-bit and therefore will demand more than 2 GB of RAM to operate. How much memory is used depends primarily on how big the map is. On my PC, a small map starts using about 1.7 GB, a huge map starts with about 3.1 GB, while the insane map starts running at about 4.1 GB. Please note that this is about 50% less than what the game was using three months ago with smaller maps and the developers have not finished optimizing it.\n\nI find the game exciting to play, especially in the beginning phase. However, it becomes tedious when my empire approaches 100 planets with only a third of the map explored. Towards the middle of the game it is downright boring due to the number of repetitive tasks (e.g., starbase improvements) and a passive AI. The developers are working to address these issues but they still have a long way to go.\n\nThe game has multi-player capability but this option is broken in my opinion. I suspect this may be due to how the background calculations are transmitted between players since most of the game freezes and crashes occur during the handoff to another player. I look forward to Stardock resolving this issue.\n\nIf you want to participate in developing what may be the premiere space 4X game of the decade then I recommend you join in the fun, and frustrations. If you dislike things breaking for no apparent reason or desire a fully implemented game then I suggest you place this game on your wishlist.","March 29, 2015","true","720.1"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","0"

It was a little jarring to no longer see an invasion battle screen anymore, and the gameplay mechanics were a little hard to get the hang of at first, but in my experience the transition wasn't any harder than it was to transition from Dread Lords to Twilight of the Arnor and Dark Avatar. The only bug I've ever had with this game is the ship designer crashing occasionally, but it seems to have stopped with the recent patches.

Not as good as any of the Civ's. Not even as good as Master of Orion 2. I have the impression that the software team was really tallented (the game runs well, no bugs, beautiful graphics etc), but the gameplay is just plain bad. Here is my list:\n1. The tactical combat screen is pretty, but you have zero control....I have no words....Unbeleavable. I can't imagine why they would do this.\n2. The AI is brutally bad. I played about 20 turns on beginner to get the hang of it. Then played a game on normal and won easily. Then played a game on expert and won easily. The AI makes a ton of obsolete ships and is rarely aggressive in any way. Also way too easy to see how an enemy is designing his ships (heavy on lasers, missles, or guns), and design against him. AI is oblivious to rock/paper/sissors system.\n3. The diplomatic engine is bad. By 10% of the way through the game every civ hates me. But they still trade with me, often at pretty even terms. Even after I've pummeled them badly and offer peace they refuse. Your only options are: declare war and trade. You can't do anything else with the other civ's.\n4. You can build pretty fancy starbases, but they are fairly weak, and get weaker as the game goes on. The AI NEVER attacks them. If the AI, or you, attack a planet with a starbase, the starbase is not part of it. This for me was another unbelievable WTF. The starbase doesn't defend the adjacent planet?\n5. Obviously quite a bit of effort into the custom ship building, but you'd have to be nutty to be bothered doing it. So tedious. When you deck a ship out with 10 guns, they seem to all be able to fire at once, even if they're on the back of the ship.\n6. Planet building is not great. Seems like every planet is always full and you can't do anything else. Gotta wait till you can open up a new hex.\n7. The entire money system is trivial. You don't have to build any markets etc and it's easy to have enough money. I 90% ignored the monetary part of the game and it didn't matter\n8. ok, the tech tree is pretty nice and well implemented\n9. There are a bunch of galactic resources that the AI seems huge on collecting, but they have a trivial outcome on the game. They can be completely ignored\n10. There is this insane mad scramble at the start of the game to colinize every available planet. No regard to how to defend these far off empires.\n11. it is crazy easy to capture an enemy planet. You create a ship, put 3 million (or is it billion?) civilians in it, and it will defeat almost any enemy planet, even if there are 15 million people on it. The defensive improvements you can make give a trivial improvement to defence and you don't actually create solders or tanks. Lame.\n12. I liked the way you could have multiple planets support a ship building dock\n13. No spying. All you have to do is talk to other civs and you can see what techs they have and how they are decking out their ships.\n\nWow, that's more lame stuff than I would have guessed. Well, it's maybe not all that bad. I enjoyed it, but it wasn't a good game. I really think this was a result of the bad management dictating bad decisions.

But it still has bugs, and the campaign is also not available yet, so if you want to play a complete game, wait until the release. But if you are dying for a science fiction strategy game and can live with the bugs, then go get it. And it will continue getting better, even after the release.\n\nYou can design your own ships, and not only regarding its weapons and components: you can completely change their look, add blocks and parts to create your own aesthetics and etc. You can make your own unique custom civilizations, give them special traits, characteristics and ships. The visuals are awesome. The game will be fully modable, that is, modders will be able to create incredible things. The battles look epic, but beware that you can't play them, as they are meant to be looked at and see the efficiency of your ships against the enemies rather than to be played. The AI will be getting better and better as the release approaches. There are several events with choices for the player to make, but so far, there are no "massive" events that change gameplay or add new factions, which I would like a lot to be added. Also, the devs are awesome and listen to their fans.\n\nThe game series has a very interesting story, which you can take a look at here (http://www.galciv3.com/databanks/timeline) and here (http://www.galciv3.com/databanks/our-story). But even if you aren't interested in the story, you can always play a normal game outside of the yet to come campaign and create your own backstory.\n\nOne of the things I feel that is lacking in the game though is a deeper soul. It need politics, bigger events (like I mentioned above) and more things to illustrate the universe and your civilization. But the devs do have plans to include LOTS of interesting things in the expansions to come... so I have hope for these features.\n\n*After game launch edit*\n\nWell, apart from the obvious improvements and polishing, the only relevant thing I've got to talk about is the campaign. I just finished it today and have to say that it is short. But I didn't do all of the optional objectives - I rushed in several parts, and didn't play the campaign with the same depth and care I would have done in a normal game. That's because I was more interested in finishing it than enjoying it. So the campaign can be a lot longer and more interesting if you play it correctly.\n\nMy opinion about the game is still good. Honestly, I don't think that the campaign is meant to be the main game mode. It is comparable to the scenarios from Civ V. They are only a secondary game experience. The core of the game is, instead, to play the classical mode - just choose your opponents and map type and win one of the victory conditions. The same applies for GalCiv III.\n\nI really can't understand the massive negative reviews the game is getting. I haven't got bugs so far - although I might be lucky regarding bugs - and if you followed the dev streams like I did, you can rather easily understand the little flaws of the game, which the devs said they would be fixing until after the game launch. In fact, they clearly said that they will continue to add new features to the game even after launch through free patches. And if you think the game still need some deeper and more immersive mechanics (which I agree with), such as a more in depth diplomacy, United Planets system and population characteristics, then don't worry, because Stardock has said that they plan to add all of these things in future expansions and DLC, so that they can develop these features with more refinement and polish.","April 20, 2015","true","110.9"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","21","24","0","0"

With events you make choices and then use those points to spend on nice bonuses. Like ideas in eu4 or policies in civ.\nAI is the best ever seen in a turnbased 4x strategy game.\nShip designer!! You can create your own ships! Or use the default ships if you dont want to bother with it. Its like you can but dont have to.\nMapsizes are insane. The biggest map is so big you have never seen before, it has half a million tiles and is there so you can play with up to 128 civs on one map. But you can still play with 8 factions on a huge map and will have lots of fun. (recommended)\nThe engine is great, performance is good, turns are fast. DX11 and 64bit and maybe dx12 in future?\nDeveloper interaction is great. They are active on the forums, weekly twitch streams etc. They also already told us there will be 1 expansion every year for the next 3 years and will keep updating the game up to 7 years from now.\nMods!! This game will become great with mods. Its a higly modable game.\nMultiplayer!! You can play up to 4 people in multiplayer. There is no simultaneous turns but thats not an issue. You can manage your planets, set move commands, design ships, everything on another ones turn. You only need your turn to execute move ships and for battles. Great game to play coop against the AI.\nNegatives\nOne more turn syndrome\nPlanet specialization micromanagement hell on bigger maps. (Hopefully they improve it so insane maps with 100 civs is playable)","May 13, 2015","true","85.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","22","26","2","0"

All in all i like the game very much. I was a GalCiv2 big fan, and i also was a bit sceptic after seeing early images, that its to much like GalCiv2.As i played GalCiv 3  longer, i noticed the new features and started using them, resulting in different gameplay. I will write in 2 sections about my experience in points, first section overall, second comparison to Galciv2.\n\nOVerall :\n1 + Decent/good AI. I wasnt able to beat the game at highest setting, despite a few tries. Sure its mostly due to its bonuses I suppose but im still happy i wasnt. On  tough and challenging diff it still  bite back and overall did reasonable stuff. I wish there  was another setting between  tough and sucicdal.Also it would be nice if the AI was playing abit smarter , not mostly being hard due to bonuses.\n2 +The game is slow, as with all GalCiv, so you have to give it some time, learn its mechanics to have most fun.\n3 +The art and music is very nice.\n4+ Overall everything one could expect from a good  4x game: Many races, custom races, long tech tree, many events,ship design, shaping your own ideology, good writing and humour...As with all Galciv games, there is no tactical battle tough. (for some its  a plus for soem a minus)\n5 + Stable. I had one crash in the 65 hours.\n6 - Imho the early game  pace is off. The expansion race is just silly. There is no mechanic to slow you down. its colonize colonize and colonize some more with maybe a few mining starbases. In galciv2 the economy stoppped you from overextending, it doesnt seem to happen in Galciv 3.\n\nI would give the game a 8/10 i think atm. There is still some balancing and AI refining to be done imho.\n\nGalCiv 3 new features, compared to Galciv2:\n\n1- There are now strategic recources that you can use to build very powerful weapons and improvements early on. So you got this tottaly new layer, if you want to race to grab them on , and rely on them. On other hands they are scattered\nand its hard to defend the bases that are mining them. It changed my Galciv2 playstyle in a  big way.\n2-The affinty/morality is  abit different. You got a tiered tree with upgrades that you unlock. Its imho a nice change, i have i  think more fun with this then in Galciv2 approach.\n3-There are now adjecancy bonuses on planets, so you got to think a bit more about designing it.\nOverall i hadnt the impression to be playing a reskinned GalCiv 2, imho its a proper sequel.\n4- Very nice addtion of planet independent shipyards , to which you can assign up to 5 planets. Reduces micromanagement a lot.","June 7, 2015","true","89.5"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xenizkingbaby/recommended/226860/","xenizkingbaby","xeNNNNN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xenizkingbaby/","112 products in account","As someone who is new to the series I was initially impressed with the game and I still am to some extent however there are rather griping issues that are bugging the hell out of me currently.\n\nIll try to list them:\n\n1) the tutorial is not useful. Instead of it being about teaching new players or existing players about new or old mechanics and how they work and how your colonies work with production, manufacturing etc. it is instead used as a story spring board ready for the campaign.. which I really do feel like it should be for teaching as you know it is supposed to be a tutorial, Of course it has information on how things work but doesnt accurately explain it, in other words its extremely vague.\n\n2) Lack of audio communication from Characters. When talking to another race for example, or something your research scientist is telling you about your recent upgrades. I really do feel like if they added some decent voice overs it would bring a ton of depth to the game. I realise many of the old school GC players would not like this that much is clear from what ive read on forum posts concerning this however its a different time now and you need to expect that immersion is important and right now Voice Acting even a little goes a long way, nobody wants to sit their and read paragraphs upon paragraphs while playing. Adding voice acting + a on/off option would solve this anyway. I believe the campaign would benefit heavily from some voice acting immersion. instead of "oh look we're retaking earth lets click our way to victory yay". I have a fine imagination I can imagine voices for the characters but it really doesnt do them justice. in a game this big and this well known they deserve a bit more "soul" i guess would be the correct word.\n\n3) Clarity concerning modifications to your ships and fleet "military research". While most of the research details you go through are fairly solid and easy to understand, things like ship hulls and shield strength and how much it actually adds on to your ships current shield or hull strength isnt carried over and communicated properly making things seem tedious and confusing as if your research something for no reason because you dont understand where it goes or what it does fully. Examples would help this or fix it. I appreciate the lack of hand holding in the game, but again for games to be popular in the current industry they need to accomidate new players not just the old ones. Which is why many feel that the game has not innovated on what had come previously.\n\n4) Governance is ...outdated. Frankly with competition like Civ and others in the mix Governance is an expceptionally dull part of an otherwise enjoyable game. I personally think if they wish to rival Sid's civ games then they really should of though about going a step further than they have or maybe a few steps. Instead of giving a player a set ammount of tiles you should of been able to zoom in and actually build upon the planet you found place your city yourself and the various things you need to get production and influence going etc and by that I mean actually control workers to do thats etc and have way more than simply under 10 or 20 tiles per planet or even under 5. I realise that many will use the arguement of "but its not trying to compete with it" or whatever however companies no longer have a choice these days unless they want to make money and frankly the changes ive suggested are hardly anything that would harm your experience if anything it would improve it. What had so much potential seems squandered.\n\n5) Space battles. When launching real time battles between fleets its abundantly obvious that the battle viewer is extremely underdone, ships consistantly fly out of view..the free cam movement is extremely redundant as moving seems almost a chore rather than something you can enjoy as you watch your fleet tear the enemy apart, its clear that this needs to be dealt with and frankly if it isnt, it will be something that ruins the game.\n\nConclusion:\n\nA game with enormous potential but fell short of it due to being stuck in the past, the graphics are updated and its new enough not to be called a "reskin" based on what ive watched from other videos of GC II HOWEVER this game is stuck in its own past. Instead of innovating they simply stayed still all be it with a few side steps on a couple of things which I personally think is what destroyed my opinion of this game. Now its still possible a lot of the things ive mentioned will be changed or fixed so I will give this game a little more time but this game is far from what stardock hope to achieve which apparently is "The largest, most advanced, strategy game possible.\n\nVerdict?\n\nNot recommended, especially at £30. As I have said while I largely enjoyed this game It frankly just did not hit the marks it needs too in this current day and age, Im glad a game is trying to stick to its roots but if a series is to improve itself it must go forward and not be stuck in the past, I will continue to play this game and try a bit harder to enjoy it though frankly if it was a decent game for the era I would already enjoy it thus I wouldnt have to try.\n\nWhat is starteling is im finding im enjoying Beyond Earth more than this and thats for one reason:\n\nDepth. Now I know what your thinking "Beyond Earth, Depth? Don't make me laugh" but frankly its true if theres one good thing you can say about that alpha centauri mess up is that at least they tried to make the game at least seem like its got a bit of soul. While GC III does a great job of making the galaxy look beautiful (to an extent) and letting you decide what you want your civilization to be it losing out massively on the things ive listed perhaps bar number one as a tutorial shouldnt be the focus of a whole game. Until they add voices and more depth and explainations as to how things work in game by providing an in-game source and fixing the various new features to actually work properly I cannot actually immerse myself in this game not can I call it a good game beyond a simple "meh its okay". if you prefer the silent type and unnessasarily complex mechanics in games then this game is for you if you prefer much more immersion and a bit more ease so you can just have fun without having too feel like your reading a book rather than playing a game I would advise you not buy this until that changes. it is stuck in the past and frankly its sad, it has so much potential but falls quiet short of a great game in my opinion.\n\nClearly Stardock have put a great deal of effort into the game but they got too focused on "sticking to the roots", you can stick to your roots and still evolve your game, however it seems they had no idea how to beyond improving a few small things and improving the graphics thats about it.","May 16, 2015","false","63.5"," 52 of 79 people (66%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","66","52","79","5","0"

The progress was slow at the beginning but the game was, and is running stable. There are still bugs but those aren't frequent. It simply feels like a very solid basis and gets better and better with every update. Now the devs are punching out updates quite often and those mostly add many new features and mechanicks to the game. So you don't need to be afraid that the game gets abandoned.\nMost of the features are already in the game now so you can enjoy playing already. I still think that the AI is plain stupid but that is a subject to change.\nThe game looks beautiful. Lots of nice artwork for colonies and events.\nGameplay is like Gal Civ 2 (what is good) but it also has some new features that make sence, so the game looks even better - it is not just a cheap remake.\nThe ship designer for example looks very nice and is better then in Gal Civ 2 already.\nThe battles don't look that good jet but I'm sure that this is not the final version of it anyway. (early acces it is)\nWhat makes me feel confident about this game, is that it seems to be built on a solid basis and that the devs know what they are doing so there is not much that could go wrong.\nI'm really looking forward into this game when it gets finished because I'm having fun playing already.\nIf you like round based 4X games, then grab it, you (most likely) won't regret it.","April 20, 2015","true","36.6"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

It looks a bit better, and they've stuck Civ's policy tree and strategic resources onto it, but it still has the same problems as GC 2: You need to constantly spam out constructors to build and upgrade starbases but there is no good automation of the process, there's no practical information about where to setup trade routes, and you need to manually build everything on planets due to tile and adjacency bonuses. On top of that, the AI is a lot worse (get used the MUCH weaker races trying to extort money from you and being mad when you refuse) and the combat camera is super wonky. The game is also fairly unpolished, there's various missing texts and the UI calls the same systems by different names in different places which leads to confusion.\n\nWith all the same old problems and worse AI anyone who has played previous galcivs will soon be bored of this one - save you money, wait for a big sale if you really want to try this. If you like 4x games consider checking out Distant Worlds, Star drive 2, or Star ruler 2.\n\nThey also sold this to early buyers at 40% off with the promise it was the lowest pre-release price but then sold it multiple times for 50% off during Early Access, which was quite the con.","May 20, 2015","false","5.6"," 49 of 74 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","49","74","4","5"

I'm a first time reviewer, and I'm posting because Civ: Beyond Earth was a huge disappointment to me, so I'll admit I was ready for another let down.  But this has been a really fun game so far and I want to see good work rewarded!\n\nI consider myself a strategy game veteran but not a min-maxer, so I set the difficulty at one above normal and dived in.  I got my butt kicked.  The second time I have been more successful, but I have seen the computer making a lot of smart moves.  For example, it noticed my fleet maneuvers threatening its worlds and preemptively declared war, and another AI tried a military build up while I was distracted and tried to stab me in the back.  I dumped all my production into new warships to raise my relative level of power, and it backed off.  All of this was trackable via diplomacy indicators, which was really cool.  While it is still early, it looks like the AI in this game is significantly better than I am used to in the strategy genre which is a major plus (sorry, I am not a fan of multiplayer turn based strategy).\n\nIn fact, the game seems in general “designed” for AI – the systems play to its strengths rather than being cool on paper but easily exploitable by a human player.  The diplomacy is awesome, and that is because the AI gives clear feedback on why it is reacting the way it is.  “I need to research diplomacy tech to offset the penalty from my weaker military and the fact that I am trading with their enemy” is the kind of decision making that is actually possible in this game, rather than just being attacked (or ignored) seemingly at random.\n\nShip design is a blast, and I am a fan of the combat system.  On the surface it appears to be a “rock-paper-scissors” type interaction between offense and defense, but this covers a higher degree of complexity beneath the surface.  For example, some weapons are fast firing and short ranged, others are smaller and more powerful but cost more to research for their level in the tech tree.  So far, it all seems “balanced” and I feel there is a lot of depth here I haven't discovered.\n\nI am also having way more fun with the race designer than I should be.  The fact that you can design your own races (every race in the Warcraft and Master of Orion universe for me), give them custom graphics, and play against them is really cool.\n\nMy initial impressions are nothing but positive.  If you are a fan of turn based strategy (specifically, 4x), I recommend this one.

I've been a huge fan of the series, and was really excited by the new features promised in this latest installment.  Sadly, none of those exciting features seem to have made it to the final product.  No "unique" tech trees (they're actually less unique than those found in GalCiv 2), "flexible ideology" is a joke, and the drastic increase in map size is coupled with a drastic decrease in the number of usable planets and stars.  Planetary resources and bonus tiles often end up completely separated from everything else (negating some of their worth), and sometimes a bonus tile is generated directly under the colonial capital where it appears to be utterly useless.\n\nWorse, options that were available in both previous games have completely disappeared, while others have been inexplicably made into DLC.  I can't set a seed for galaxy generation, can't filter known planets for colonization, there are no save and load hotkeys, and no ability that I could find to regenerate the map when I'm handed a crappy one (which is often).  Gameplay-wise, the game is unbalanced, and progression is plodding at best.  Frankly, this game still plays like it's in beta, and it's been out for half a year already.  I'm hoping that Stardock will find a way to pull this one out of the crapper, but I don't see how they'd manage it at this late date.  I understand that they were trying to put a fresh new spin on everything, but they only succeeded in reducing the players' scope and options and the game's playability.\n\nTLDR;  Even if you're a huge fan, save your money.

This game moves as Civilization V did to hex grids but it do allow stacking ships something Civ V did not allow. One other major difference is the way units are, instead of having this historical unit or set unit Galactic Civilization expands on the previous entries in its franchise and offer you to customize every single aspect of a ship. Its like having a Lego box with thousands of Lego parts, you want to build a boombox with a head like a unicorn that shoots lasers go ahead.

If you don't like the sound of it, I'd advise to steer clear of the game\n\nThe game actively encourages specialisation, with most improvements giving bonuses to other adjacent improvements of the same catagory.  From capturing AI planets I can see it has trouble actually doing this properly, which explains a lot about the disappointing AI performance.\n\nA planet can only build one improvement per turn.  Improvements always start out at the most basic level and then must upgrade through every subsequent "level" the player has unlocked.  This is a game where one tile= one improvement and planets can have over 25 tiles.  As the game lacks a good (any) governing or overflow mechanic this introduces a HUGE amount of micromanagement, making large maps horribly tedious.\nEither the player sits there twiddling his thumbs for 10-30 turns after each new tech unlocks, or he manually goes and adjusts production values for all his planets every time something happens.  Some people say this is a good reason not to specialise, but it still means planets can take stupidly long to finish upgrading and still requires/encourages micromanagement.\n\nIn the end I think it's just bad game design.  When I saw the game was out of beta and one upgrade/turn still hadn't been "fixed", I was surprised.  I'd always just assumed it was a bug; not because I want l33t OP planets, but because that's  what seemed natural for the system Stardock created.  Atm it's just left in this weird balance limbo...  not what I'd expect for the price-tag in a release game.\n\nOn the + side it's hard to run out of credits, so I got to swim in piles of gold like Scrooge Mc Duck!","June 24, 2015","false","64.0"," 33 of 47 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","33","47","0","0"

There are frequent minor bugs and occasional major issues that cause freezes or hiccups, and rarely but still-too-common crashes. Inconsistencies in in-game play rules make unit travel and pathfinding unreliable and often nonsensical. Tedious and unfun micromanagement of planetary construction is required, as the in-game AI for planet development is unreliable and does not build in effective ways. Recent updates have been removing important tools for economy and production control. On top of this, many things are being released as payed DLC that should be included features, making the game incomplete and requiring extra payment beyond the initial purchase to access core features. These were released after my purchase, and I had expected regular content updates to the game as it was developed, not DLC releases.","November 4, 2015","false","86.7"," 29 of 40 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","29","40","2","1"

The core mechanics are relatively simple, but offer a lot of depth; which makes it easy to get into, but difficult to master. A good sign for any such game.\n\nBUT... there is one major drawback. This game is simply incomplete. There are an insurmountable number of bugs and glitches that ruin the fun; sometimes by causing the game to outright crash.\n\nOn a slight tangent; earlier this year when Paradox Interactive announced that they would be delaying the release of HoI4, I was upset. But, their reason was to avoid delivering a buggy game to the consumers. Such an attitude would have been wholly appreciated here.\n\nLastly, I don't understand why the developers didn't integrate the modding of this game with the Steam Workshop.

This is monster of a game that requires a 64 bit processor to play and for good reason. The largest map size would take months to complete against up to 120+ AI players plus a few of your friends. If you played other 4x games you could expect 10 minute turn times but no. The AI calculate it's turn during your turn and does so very quickly by using as many processor cores available to it. Turn times is almost instant.\n\nThe player can also create their own ship designs to fight in the battle viewer that uses a rule set to determine the final outcome. Although you don't have direct control of combat that doesn't mean combat is boring. You design a fleets to invade the enemies space and the the AI is able to adapt to your U.S.S. Pwnage and send you back to the design board.\n\nColony Management has a puzzel-esque feel. Each building buffs other similar buildings. So no two colonies are the exact same.\n\nThe game is beautiful.

However at this time multiplayer is barely functional with numerous bugs and limitations.\n\nGame lobby is lacking. Can't see racial information, Can't have more than one of each AI race. Can't see or change game options once people join lobby. Can't have more than 4 human players. Can't play on any decently large maps. Can't use custom races, Can't change color. Can't make private or set password on games. the list goes on.\n\nOnce in the game you get to deal with bugs and bad MP design. Auto upgrading of buildings queues 4 times for each building. Players play in turn and while you can do a part of your turn between turns several signifigant parts of your turn you can't. this makes for very slow turn cycles.\n\nThere are also game sync bugs. Issues loading saves,\n\nWith all of this (and there is more but I'm getting tired of trying to think of everything) There are also all of the general bugs and issues that both SP and MP games deal with.\n\nI expect this game will be very good in SP sometime soon. I really hope all of the issue with MP are fixed as well. At this time however I do not think this game is worth $50, or $30 for that matter. Fix the bugs and I'll be happy I bought the game.

I like how the next button does not show up if you have an idle ship, planet, research, or space dock.  At first I was not sure about it, but now I find that it’s actually rather helpful, to let me know if I have a ship I forgot and its doing nothing.  So good job on that.\n\nAbout the diplomatic system.  I think its not complete.  There was one bill that came in to abolish all current wars, and everyone voted yes, but the 2 wars I was in was not abolished and I was still being attacked.  Also there was an election for the chair and the two races I was at war with voted for me.  That kinda seems odd, I thought they would vote against me.  So perhaps the AI needs some tweaking.\n\nThe Difficulty.  Maybe the difficulty settings are not complete, but I was playing on the easiest that it allows, and I still found it to be a bit hard.  I am a casual gamer. In Galactic Civilizations II, there was a good range of difficulty, the where even some settings that where too easy for me, and some that are too hard.  But in GC III, the lowest setting is a bit too hard for a low setting, so I hope even lower, and perhaps higher settings will come in eventually.\n\nI have noticed sometimes while I am in the manage dialogue box for a planet, and hover over a bonus slot, the details are not completely readable due to the box not being big enough.\n\nThere is one thing I am hoping that would be added.  Galactic Civilizations II for me was nearly a perfect game.  It had so many propertys that where awesome about it.  but there was one downfall in my opinion.  The combat system.  Its okay being able to see the battle conspire, but it was still a bit lame.  I hope that in Galactic Civilizations III there would be a combat system similar to Star Wars Empire at War.  Being able to command the ships you build in battle would greatly take this game to the next level.

I haven’t tried the in-game campaign and have played only single-player using medium and large galaxies vs. all 8 in-game AI factions + assorted minor factions.   You can go much bigger than that if your machine will support it, but I've found large galaxies make for very satisfying games.  I highly recommend smaller galaxies for your first games, so that you can get going more easily.  As others have pointed out, the bigger you play, the more RAM you will need.\n\nSummary:  Fun game, your decisions matter.  AI factions are entertaining, imperfect, and improving.  Ship designer keeps game interesting.  Stardock user community is active and helpful.  There is a learning curve and some rough edges, but lots of entertainment value for my money (more than most games).\n\nPros:\n\n- Most of the decisions you have to make matter.  Each tech you research, each colony improvement you build makes a noticeable improvement -- your ships become more powerful, colonies are more productive, your influence and bargaining power increase.  You aren’t overwhelmed by near-meaningless busy-work or grinding to grow your empire.\n\n- Every faction feels different, much more so than, say, in the Civ series. Tech trees change depending on which faction you play, and the strengths and weaknesses of each faction feel important.  Plus, you can make all the custom factions you want, or download others' factions from Stardock's website (Steam workshop support should be coming soon, too).\n\n- AI factions have personality and give you feedback.  An AI faction might warn you off if you're amassing ships near their border, or let you know they value the trade route you have with them.  I quickly get to like/despise/fear each faction in the game, and this also changes from one game to the next depending on your choices and how the game progresses.  One game, I was planning to go to war with one faction, but then they surprised me with a small gift, expressing admiration for my society.  So I gave them some help, we became friends and are now fighting an enemy faction together.  This has made for a much more interesting story than the old smash-em-all slog that many 4x games become.\n\n- Ship combat is more interesting than GalCiv 2 -- not just rock-paper-scissors, but ships are assigned roles like assault, guardian, escort, support, and these roles affect combat.  Your ship designs and fleet composition make a big difference.  Much like Civ, I would say the battles are fought strategically, not tactically (you're the admiral directing the war(s); you're not the captain making in-battle decisions).\n\n- The ship designer lets you make any ship you want; customize load-outs and/or appearance as you like. You can even download and use others' ship designs – some users have already posted some interesting designs.  I get weary of 4x games where every faction has the same old units -- not here.   While I haven't seen it myself yet, word from other users is that the AI will learn to use the units you design too.  Never the same game twice!\n\n- Adjacency bonuses – e.g., two factories next to each other make each other better – make planning improvements on your colonies more interesting than just loading up a build-queue.  It adds some strategic planning to your colony management without overwhelming you in too many details.\n\n- If you love to micro-manage, you can tinker with just about everything, and most of the numbers you see have pop-up tooltips showing you where they come from.  If you prefer, you can play a rewarding game without worrying about min-/maxing every little decision.\n\n- The UI and graphics have improved dramatically over GalCiv 2.  It's easy to move through the turns and most decisions can be enacted quickly and intuitively.\n\n- Nebulae, black holes, wormholes and asteroid fields add more “terrain” features to the map than GalCiv 2 had, and these can be relevant for positioning, hiding, or escape.  As well, there are more galactic resources which can be mined for improved technologies.\n\n- The Stardock user-community is generally helpful and respectful; if you have questions, ask, and someone will answer pretty quickly.\n\nCons:\n\n- If you're not really familiar with the GalCiv games of the past, or even if you are, there's a learning curve.  There is a manual on Stardock’s site, and you may need to scout the web or forums for help.  I’ve gotten answers to my questions from the Stardock user community usually very quickly.  When playing your first game or two, expect to make an occasional unfortunate decision only to learn later that it wasn’t what you might have expected.\n\n- Game is a little rough around the edges (some spelling errors, the odd tech doesn’t work the way it’s advertised, AI occasionally does something dumb), but no disastrous issues and improvements are happening all the time:  2 patches since release and version 1.1 is coming in June.  I've had one CTD, but with auto-save I lost only a couple of turns, so no big deal.\n\n- Espionage is non-existent, and Diplomacy is fairly basic – you can trade and ask another faction to go to war with/for you (for a price).  Like with any other 4x game, I expect more to come in future patches/expansions.\n\n- Not all information is accessible when you want it – e.g., you can’t review the state of your empire before responding to an AI’s trade request.  While once in a while this can be awkward, it’s far from game-breaking.\n","June 2, 2015","true","318.2"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

I bought this game in early access, last year around christmas.\nThe game was very rudimentary and not very polished, so i played a couple of hours and decided to wait till release.\n\nAnd now, I'm looking at one of the best 4x space games that have come out in years! Serious, it has flaws, but overall it is the best 4x space game you can expect these days.\n\nHere are my pros:\n\n\n- The Tech-tree is gigantic and very diversified. You have often to choose which of three possible techs you want, the others are gone, till you are able to trade the techs with someone else.\n\n\n- The building system on planets is unique and maybe you need a little practice before you are able to squeeze the last bit of efficiency out of it.\n\n\n- Colonizing planets let you make ideologic decisions, because every planet comes along with some kind of speciality.\nMaybe there are natives on the planet and you have now the possibility to decide what will happen to them.\n\nBenevolent, would let them keep their lifestyle, which leads to an increment of your ideologic points and gets you a approval   bonus.\n\nPragmatic, would keep them in a reservat and make a tourist attraction of them. (Also getting ideologic points.)\n\nMalevolent, would enslave them and use as a cheap labor force.\n\nThis system makes a lot of fun and seems to be thought through. (Maybe there are balancing issues, but we will see.)\n\n\n- A lot of winning conditions, not just war.\n\n\n- Customizing your race is nearly as good as in moo 2.\n\n\n- Special resources for prototype weapons or buildings.\n\n\n- Ship designer!\n\n\n- A rich map generator, and last but not least...\n\n\n- Multiplayer!\n\n\n\nThe cons:\n\n\n-  Combat is automatic and the battle viewer has some issues getting the scene right and your spacecraft flying in strange circles around the enemy.\n\n\n- No espionage!\n\n\n- Stability issues.\n(but i could solve mine, by increasing the swap file to at least 4 gb. No problems since. But my friend who wants to play the                                                             game with me, has a lot of problems, although he increased his swap file size too.)\n\n\n- And there are maybe a lot of other minor things that can be personal preference.\n\n\n\nAs a conclusion I can say:\n\nThis game does a lot of things right and gives you a lot of freedom which you would expect, if you played games like Master of Orion 2 before. It goes even further by giving the community the possibility to mod the game.\nYou can spend dozens of hours in custom games or in multiplayer and every game could be a new experience.\nThere is also a new campaign, which i haven't played yet, but this is a big plus for the singleplayers.\n\nBeside some features i would like to see and the bad stability, this game is (can be even better with some addons) the best experience 4x space gamers can get.\n\n\n(Sorry for the bad english!)\n","May 16, 2015","true","85.1"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","21","28","2","0"

Here are few problems:\n\nBeginning with Interface menus that do not offer even a half of the options you had before to customize your experience during gameplay. Resource icons for example make a mess out of the map when zoomed out, making it really hard to observe the gameplay. I haven't found any options to address this.\n\nTaxing system for your colonies is removed and only way to manage your economical income is through single wealth/manufacturing/research slider. I don't yet have a definitive opinion on this, but for now this new income system feels little vague.\n\nThe hype about incredible AI that utilizes each core of your expensive i7 to provide you the best and most complex GalCiv experience is just hype. Reality is that for 16 hours of gameplay I haven't noticed any singe improvement compared to GalCIv II. The opponents react exactly the same in same situations, making same diplomatic propositions, and making same strategic mistakes as before (small example: just leave barely habitable class 5 planet next to your starting homeworld and AI rush to take it, spending a colony ship and bunch of money for improvements, just to loose the planet after few turns due to overwhelming influence of your nearby homeworld).\n\nSpying is completely missing leaving you to guess what your opponents are doing, researching or building on their home planets. I read somewhere that developers plan to program "deeper" spying system than before, so they left it completely out. Really? Releasing a full-priced game without a crucial feature that existed in its predecessor, with a promise that it will be included in eventual DLCs that you have to pay for additionally?\nWhy developer haven't taken more time to finish their ideas and then release the full version, or at least implement the old style feature and then improve it later?\n\nSpeaking to another civilization should lead to trading screen right away (99% of the time this is where player wants to go), rather than opening a pointless splash screen. It is eye candy, but it is very inconvenient as you have to click twice. Furthermore, "trade with you", and "declare war on you" are two choices just next to each other making it a miss-click accident waiting to happen.\n\nThere are more smaller and bigger issues to remark and I will edit this interview if I find more or if I change my opinion on it, but in its current state this release is not worth the money as it offers less than GalCiv II.","December 31, 2015","false","61.8"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","23","32","2","1"

The UI is lackluster, dialogues don't even mention what race is contacting you. You can't check other info before making decisions.\n\nConsequences seem to have little affect, even being at war feels unexciting. Special resources seem massively overpowered, and you can rule the game using experimental weapons so much more powerful than conventional weapons. The manufacturing pace feels out of balance. Killing a shipyard mid game and have it respawn the next turn.\n\nThe game is buggy - I made ship designs in a previous game that required large hull research, in a new game I could build these even though they were overweight if I tried to design it afresh. I've been able to build ships that require special resources with no limit, going endlessly into negative special resources.\n\nThe game crashed to desktop, frequently, without any real reason.\n\nThe battle sequences are completely pointless, take forever and look terrible (especially the way the ships slide sideways and backwards awkwardly). Nobody will ever bother to watch one out, a waste of the developers time.\n\nAll in all the game does what you expect. It's a 4x game with nothing very wrong. Just, everything is sub-par. What you'd expect from a 15 yr old game. Every 4x game I've played in the last 5+ years is better.

This is a superb 4x strategy game, anyone who has played and enjoyed previous Gal Civ titles is going to love this.\n\nNow that the game has been officially released, I have had a chance to complete the campaign, it was good, but a little short...

I always played custom games on the previous version on the largest map possible with max civs too. I love playing a grand, long game that takes forever to finish. I really can't say there is much i do not like about the game except that it does not come with a wide variety of pre-made factions but you can create all the custom factions you want to have more opponents if you wish. It's just all the good things i liked about the previous installment on a grander scale. More and bigger is better imo. Keep up the good work. I am looking forward to expansions that add more races and possibly more tech trees, or custom tech trees would be cool. The more techs and variety the better and more interesting the game will be.

On top of that it looks good, is modable and has a great community of players.\n\nBut (at least at this time) this game is a single endeavor of frustration for me.\n\nThe AI is of palpable incompetence. Due to focus on expansion I had next to no military fleets and a "Godlike" Drengi race declared war on me (finally!) and then did not attack me for 20 turns.  Even then their attacks amounted only to some unorganized probing attacks, while they wasted their time churning up a minor race at the other end of the map.  That is not "Godlike", but rather stupid.\n\nThe diplomacy is hit and miss. I have seen worse and you can work out some nice deals with neighbors. However, as soon as you even start to build enough ships to defend just your core worlds (and not every nook and cranny of your empire) they get worried about your militarism and even the best relations decline rapidly.\n\nThe worst? Bugs, crashes, crippling gameplay issues that bleed all the fun totally dry.\n\nRight now I am +15 hours into building an empire. Am allied with two minor and a major race and at war with two majors and a minor. I do have roughly 20 starbases deployed. Whenever I now hit "TURN" for the next turn, a battle between two Drengi fleets and two of my scouts happens. Which always ends with the scouts getting destroyed. Right when that happens, my game crashes. Regardless if I chose "Quick Battle" or decided to watch it.\n\nSo I load the last save. Which was done JUST before hitting "TURN". And I have to "Upgrade Starbase" again for half a dozen Starbases where I just had said "Pass" to refuse the updating as I am waiting for a more worthwhile update later on. So after clicking through that AGAIN and hitting "TURN", the battles take place again and the game crashes yet again.\n\nWhen I destroy the two Scouts myself, another space battle (a minor against one of my Survey ships) takes place and results in yet another crash.\n\nSo .... looks like the +15 hours I poured into that "Empire" are lost. Do I want to start over yet again? Not until these crippling bugs are ironed out.\n\nStardock has not done itself a favor selling a beta as a "full" game.

It could be the best space strategy game out there. However, two major shortcomings prevent it from fulfilling its promise. First, the interface is entirely inadequate to manage large scale empires - one of its supposedly major advantages over its predecessor. Once you control more than a a few dozen worlds, star bases and ships, this game becomes micro management hell. For example, there is no way to upgrade a whole fleet, you'll have to do it piece by piece. GalCiv's other major weakness are bugs. It's not unplayable but there are just too many to really enjoy it. Why is the guard function not working? Why does it crash or hang every so often? Why does the AI behave so erratically, declaring war and begging for peace the very next turn?\n\nI've decided to stop playing for now and give it another try in a couple of updates.

Galactic Civiliztions 2 is however a far superior game to this DLC and sorely lacking game. Both games are very similar. Gal Civ 3 has superior graphics but not really by much and Gal Civ 2 was a far better game overall bar a memory leak issue which basically killed the game for long term players and stopped any serious modding. Gal Civ 3 does not impress me at all with no real new features, some old ones missing and a dev team more involved in squezing DLC money out of the consumers pockets than actually making a good game. The community really supported the developers the whole way and continue to but they continue to fail to actually bring anything new or impressive. The community practically built this game for the developers with serious bug testing and fixes coming from the very early days. As soon as the engine was running the community has been playing, testing and developing. And what thanks do we get, well none at all. the game is barely finished and if you really want to get angry just check the DLC section. The developers basically sold half a game and are asking more money for very little. Only now is it considered playable with serious issues occuring after official release and continung still but again the community works around it or simply fixes the problems themselves. My faith in the developer is gone. You've detroyed a game i loved. On a final note your modding system also sucks. You should have stuck with the old system that everyone understood and loved instead of the travesty you settled on.","February 21","false","62.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","3"

As seen with this AI this step into 64bit has made this game exponentially better, as it is the best 4x AI I have ever played against. This AI is multi-dimensional in terms of play styles and personalities of each of the Races and the it has this impressive ability to pick up new factions. For example you create a race via custom race editor that you can play which is really cool. However it gets grander when with a few settings the AI can actually play your previous race creations as Major factions. I repeat Major faction not minor so this they way you can customize your entire gameplay experience even if you do not like the default vanilla races, or expand it and have 16 races instead of the original 8 lol.\nThis idea also applies to the Ship designer in regards to simplicity and adaptability it is very easy to pick up and learn the basics and as you play with it you quickly discover it has incredibly powerful advanced options from size, 3 axis offsetting parts, all the way to even adding animations to individual parts or sections. This allows you to be incredibly creative further more these ships can be saved and exported to other games later on as this feature can be quite a time-sink making you fall in love with your creations. Therefore the import and Export tool is incredibly satisfying to see thought was put into taking a old feature and keeping it great if not make it greater.\n\nsince it meets my expectations all around I have little negative to say at this stage I have not attempted Multiplayer at this stage so I cannot comment on this (it was not working during beta 3 but since then have not tried again)\nrare crashes in beta 6 but based on release patch notes these seemed to be fixed.\n\nOk this ended up getting a little longer then intended and quite biased in the positive direction that said I had an idea of what to expect and it delivered so I dont have many cons at this time hahaha sorry","May 14, 2015","true","304.0"," 38 of 61 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","38","61","3","2"

I've played through a few games and overall I think I got bored of it pretty quickly.\n\nI think this is one of those games where if you want to put 100 hours into a round and customize your ships to the nth degree, it could be fun.  But for those without all day long to spend micro designing your fleets, it's quite a grind.\n\nHere's my major gripes:\n\n1) The culture aspect is super unbalanced.  You can win the whole game by just playing super defensive and focus heavily on spreading your culture.  You can turn planets to your own side by doing nothing.\n\n2) Some aspects of the game just aren't useful for anything.  I.E., military starbases.  They're purely defensive, and they don't even get involved in a battle unless the enemy specifically attacks them.  It would make way more sense if they provided defensive coverage in a "zone".\n\n3) They spent time creating some visuals for space battles.  You see them in the screenshots for the game.  They add absolutely nothing to the overall content of the game.  Yeah its kind of fun to watch it like twice, but then you just end up turning all of it off because it takes a long time for the game to have a "space battle" that had an outcome calculated before the battle started.  Should have spent that dev time adding other cool things.\n\n4) Diplomacy AI is weak.  To be fair, almost no game gets this right.","May 20","false","92.5"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","2"

It has a few flaws that are quite frustrating among the stuff that actually are good.\n\nTo begin with, aliens declare war at the drop of a hat for no good reason, and as soon as war is declared, it's a pain to get peace. That means that between warring aliens and pirate bases trade become useless unless you provide escorts (slow, expensive escorts that would be better used at the frontlines) to maybe reach a currently reasonably friendly alien planet.\n\nSecondly, the ground combat is resolved with a mouse click. That's it. No invasion cut scenes, no ground combat tactics, no fighting done. And it is done within 1 week. Yes. With one transporter, you will take over a planet in one week. That's so bad words can't describe it.\n\nThe game is a bit silent. The music is perfect, and it's never tiring to hear, but there is the usual (scientifically wrong) booms in space, and there's no voice acting, not even from the science advisor in your team. That's a pretty bad flaw too.\n\nIt does get a bit repetitive over time, especially on large maps when you are in a perpetual war from pretty much the start: build a star base to increase the operative range of your fleets, invade a planet, collect your fleets again, rinse and repeat.\n\nBut apart from those flaws, the game is fine - the customization options are endless, and fiddling around with the designer to make your own ships is a ton of fun.\n\nOverall, I'll give this a solid 6/10. Well worth a buy, but not at this price, so wait until it goes down a few bucks.","June 6, 2015","true","121.3"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

However, if you are looking for an innovative 4X game that redefines the genre norms, you might consider the design a bit too safe.\n\nThe Good\nThe race customisation options are very cool, there is decent variety in the technology tree and ideology tree.  There are lot of ways to play via the different victory types, set-up options and campaign (albeit brief the missions are fun particularly at higher difficulty).\n\nThe galaxy has a good range of events, bonuses, resources, pirates and minor civilizations particularly if you play with the Precursor Worlds DLC.\n\nThe diverse personalities of the races is very noticeable both in the diplomacy interactions and the way they actually play.  Playing against other custom factions available via the Steam workshop is quite fun.\n\nThe AI is okay but well behind Gal Civ 2.  The AI can build colonies up well but doesn't use some mechanics effectively such as Diplomacy and has extremely weak late game strategies.  The game can provide a challenge early, though.\n\nThe User Interface is intuitive and easy to use.\n\nThe game really is quite beautiful graphically for the most part (except the battle viewer, we'll get to that below).\n\nIn summary, I've enjoyed the game a lot more than I expected and had plenty of playtime.\n\nThe Bad\nThe game is very poorly balanced and there are a large number of excessive exploits available to the player.  In particular, the diplomacy system is the most expoitable system I can recall in any 4X game ... ever.  I've posted save games on the Stardock forums to no avail e.g. Alliance Victory on Godlike Difficulty on a Huge map in just 36 turns etc, etc.\n\nStarbases are a micromanagement nightmare.\n\nThere is a lack of innovation in the game.  Some consider this a positive, and while I agree there is a formula that shouldn't be messed with too much, I couldn't describe the game as leading the 4X genre as a result.  At least not yet.\n\nThe combat is really dull and in particularly it's graphically lame (disappointing given how stunning Sins of a Solar Empire was to look at from Stardock).\n\nUnfortunately there are no cool end game threats (saved for expansions no doubt).  If you want World Destroyers, Stellar Converters or other cool stuff, you'll like have to look elsewhere.\n\nThe Lowdown\nMost 4X fans will enjoy the game but some are going to find the lack of innovation a turn off.\n\nIf you are on the fence about this game I would probably wait.  Stardock are committed to continuing to improve the game and do offer pretty deep sales from time to time.  That said, as a Space 4X fan, I'll likely continue to load it up again after each major update.","May 12, 2015","true","651.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

This is important because I have the following options to satiate my need for space empiring: Endless Space, Sins of a Solar Empire: Revellion and Homeworld. If I had to choose between the 3, I would choose GC3, followed by Endless Space.\n\nMy main gripe with GC3 is the lack of species to choose from. I feel like the devs spent this time on developing and integrating modding tools into the game to allow anyone to create their own civs very easily. Creating your own civ involves having some artwork, selecting/creating some ship designs, writing some fiction and ultimately filling in survey with a lot of tickboxes to determine the AI's behaviour and the advantages of the species - and perhaps because of how easy they've made it, I find it irritating that they couldn't have added many many more species. There are around 5 species in the vanilla version. I think the mercenaries DLC adds two species.\n\nThe range of ships also suffers from a lack of content but not to the same level - I am less upset about this however as the ship editor is excellent and there are some modders who have created impressive forgeries of licensed ships such as Star Wars, Star Trek, Games Workshop and BattleStar Galactica. Civilisations from these licenses are also available but this content is far less impressive and none of it comes close to the quality of vanilla content.\n\nGalactic Civilizations 3 is pretty good as far as 4X space games go. However it's more akin to games like Civilization 5, Age of Wonders and Endless Legend then it is to other space 4X games like Endless Space and Space Empires. This is not necessarily a bad thing however, and as the quality of what is there is so high I end up playing GC3 over it's competitors anyway.\n\nOverall I would recommend the game at 20 NZD which is ~ 30 USD.","May 20","true","38.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","1"

I followed all of their guidelines to get the game to work properly. I have since researched and come to find that the game is very specific on the systems it will run on. Their notice is 64 bit windws 7 or later. But it is much much more picky than that. Also anytime someone reports a game crash or issue all you get is use our reporting tool.

So games like Civ5 and other more recent 4x games are far far more pleasing to look at.\n\nAs far as gameplay, it's very well done except, with the distances so large, and the ships movement so teeny tiny, it takes forever to get a ship or fighter or whatever, from point a to point b. I mean, each ship can only move about 2 hexs during the first 10 hours or so of gameplay before more research is done. Considering that typical planet is  20 hexes from the next nearest point, that's totally insane and feels really like you're in slow motion.

Beta I could go with the flow with bugs etc.  Now with full release, that's not happening...  With my update to this review months after, they're almost worse.  Multiplayer still is plagued with bugs.  The devs don't have enough sense to play their game themselves so they set up "10 computers and let the AI run overnight"...   I think from all the negative reviews they're scared to try it on their own.  Even the log in screen for multiplayer bugs out constantly (Something even 1 billion computers running AI overnight wouldn't reveal).  It doesn't even have a password protect so everytime you're waiting for your friend to join, some other random numbnutz joins your game.

This time it's from a recommend to a a not recommend.\n\nI had faith that Stardock would fix the many issues with the game, but come expansion pack 1 and so many issues have yet to be sorted out.  Rather than holding onto hope you have to just look at the reality of the situation.  Stardock has also pretty much stated that they are pushing any meaningful changes to the game into a standalone expansion next year.\n\nI have put a lot of hours into the game, though 3/4 was during the beta and most of that spent in the ship designer.  It is my favourite feature, but even that gets boring.  It also hasn't seen any love since early beta, though to be fair the game had a lot more issues to deal with and intended features that we are stil waiting for.  The point is I haven't spent much time playing the game as it were.  The fact I have been able to or bothered to finish a sandbox game (and I don't play on particularly large maps) since launch is not a great sign.\n\nThings might turn around in the next year.  Maybe bug fixes and DLC will make me change my mind (again).  We'll see.\n\nHowever, the 4X genre is an exciting one at the moment with the new MoO, Endless Space 2, Stellaris, Polaris Sector, etc all on the horizon.  At one time I thought GC3 might be able to offer a bit of competition to them.  I no longer do.  Therefore it might be better if instead of paying US$50 for this to wait for one of the other games to come out.  Though maybe just keep an eye on GC3 for the standalone expansion due for 2017.  Maybe it can bring the magic back to the franchise.","February 22","false","144.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The shipyards, while a cool idea, can be annoying. If you don't have a fleet strong enough you can't defend your shipyard from aggression, so they made the shipyard overpowered in the early game which can be annoying if you have pirates right outside your doorstep. You also can't build starports on your home planet which is probably because you'd have a planet building two ships at once. But all you need to do is make it so that a planet with a starport can't build ships at shipyards. The fact that you can't build starports on planets is contradictory to the campaign where Earth built a massive armada at the height where planes fly without a shipyard. The last negative is the campaign. While this game's main draw is the singleplayer sandbox, the campaign deserves the same attention the gal civ 2 campaign got. There's three missions, 2 cutscenes (the first one being the best part of the campaign) and some nice dialogue. I beat the campaign in two days. I won't spoil the end, but trust me it's not worth it. Also it doesn't explain the rest of the story, which I was hoping for. I was also hoping Stardock would explain how the Iridium Corporation came to be in game. That way you wouldn't have to search for it on the website. But at the end of the day it's all about the money and I think Stardock is going to release a dlc and force it's customers to pay to complete the story. I was really hoping Stardock wouldn't stoop to that level. As for the rest of the game I think it's a fantastic game. I wished they still had those mega events from gal civ 2 because as far as I know there are none. Final Verdict is 7/10, mostly because the story was very disappointing and the shipyards oh god the shipyards. However I do recommend the game for 4x fans.","May 18, 2015","true","40.3"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","19","28","0","0"

Overall this is a simple strategy game which is easy to play however it has a number of flaws.  Firstly you have no tactical control over battles which I found increasingly annoying.  Secondly if you build a large empire you wind up with a miserable population as there is a massive penalty for having a large empire and no matter how many approval boosting buildings will overcome this.  Equally if you have a large empire winning by conquest is very easy as the other empires aren't large enough to oppose you. The introductory graphics seem to suggest large fleets and this is simply not possible.  I tend to find I have Capital ships facing a few small ships and it's then like dropping bombs into barrels of fish so easy victories.

Building on planets is far more tactical now as adjacency matters big time.  The battles however fall short of the huge ones youre used to in GalCiv2, and the AI seems dumb as hell sometimes.  Make sure you turn off conquest as a victory condition otherwise every game seems to be a rush to invade and ignore all the other techs.  Military starbases seem utterly useless as all they do is slow enemy travel unless they decide to attack it directly.

I suspect that my problem - and perhaps that of some other players - is that the beta and upgrade installation system didn't work quite right.

This is somehow both. This is also the first review I've ever felt inclined to write.\nThis game is like Civilization, Eve Online and the board game Twilight Imperium all rolled into one. Sounds like an awesome game. But a lot of the features feel largely incomplete. There are a lot of balance issues, and things like tourism and other money making things seem like they haven't really been fleshed out. Money seems almost superfluous. All great ideas, but even a rudimentary economy needs more attention than these have been given.\nEarly on in a level, my capital and starting planet have some level of importance. I care about what structures I build. But as the game winds on, planets and resources and even my territory and units just seem so pointless.\n\nMaybe it's the lackluster battles involving an oddly large amount of micromanagement to prepare for, but no real control.\n\nMaybe it's the constant spelling and grammar errors. Like, I'm the kind of person that notices spelling and grammar errors in basically every game I've ever played for the past 20 years. But this was insane.\n\nAnd the stakes just seem so low when the game feels so unfinished. Awesome concept, and there is definitely a game somewhere in there! But this is not a finished game. This is what we come to expect from these pre-released games. Everyone buys into it, and they try to make these deadlines, but they've mostly moved on to the next project.\n\nAgain, I look forward to future updates, and I will keep my eye on this game. But as it stands, I don't feel it was worth my money, and it does not feel like the "V1.0" that the reputable companies of yesteryear would have produced. Hopefully that changes, because there are some really great games out there that rely on pre release funding, and if you don't finish your game, you bring the whole medium down a peg.","May 21, 2015","false","25.2"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","0"

For example, a basic factory building might be 40% production bonus and take a few turns to build, or can be bought with starting cash. The strongest racial production bonus is also of the same order (around 25% as I recall), but only for either ships or buildings. So its basically worthless.\n\nSame exact issue with both space stations and planetary modifiers to production, science etc. All are % based, and largely meaningless compared to a few low-tier cheap building.\n\nThis problem is all over the place in the core mechanics. Overly simplistic to the point of hurting the simulation.\n\nIt very much feels like they have missed the point that fun games arent perfectly balanced. A lot of the most famous games of this genre were famous because they had unbalanced, and fun tricks the players could learn. Not that this game has perfect balance, but it sure seems to try to keep all choices when setting up a game as boring as possible, to ensure you cant do anything fun.\n\nOh, and lets not forget the nickel and diming they have fully embraced by cutting out content that was in the previous game, and adding it as DLC released a month after the game.

Hope the Devs fix the game soon. There are too many little things (I have a list of about 40) in Gal Civ 3 that needs to be fix but never gets fix unless you mod the game yourself. I will list a few.\n\n1. No manual placement of shipyards and colony capital. Capital can get stuck right in the middle of a high class planet. At least for the shipyard I can build a shipyard with a constructor.\n\n2. Can't launch ships from whatever direction you want from the shipyard. Sometimes it auto launch in an asteroid field slowing down movement. The upcoming 1.61 patch makes it so ships won't launch in asteroids anymore. In Gal Civ 2 you can pick what direction you want to launch ships from.\n\n3. The tech tree UI is out of date from 2006 Gal Civ 2. Even Endless Space had a tech web where you can zoom in and out on one screen with all the techs. ES had the ability to queue research but not in Gal Civ 3.\n\nThe original Gal Civ 3 is worth 7.25 / 10 and with all the updates and newest expansion it is worth 7.75 / 10. Sometimes it just feels something is missing when playing Gal Civ 3, some features that were in Gal Civ 2 were remove in Gal Civ 3.","February 25","false","306.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","2"

I created a ship using the Ship Designer and it worked fine (at first) then I created another ship spending 45minutes getting it just the way I like it. I went to save the ship as a template so that I could change the loadout on it when the game saved the file as my original design! I lost all that work that I put into the ship and will never see it again! This is the frustrating part of playing a beta, the bugs are frustrating. I have since tried to make several quick test ships and they all have the same problem, they all save as the first ships design. When I highlight the template to try and delete it the game crashes.\n\nI like the concept, but wish I had waited for the full release. I cant at this time recommend this game until the bugs are worked out and all the functions are functioning.\n\n*UPDATE* My game, much to my surprise has miraculously made a full recovery. I did nothing but log in one day just to see if I could correct the issue and found that the issue has corrected itself! With Crashgate behind me and a good 20hrs sunk into this game, I can now reccomend it. However, there is a caveat attatched, your individual results may vary when playing this game and you could grow to have a love hate relationship with it (in Beta). That said, I do like the game when working properly, AI is weak but that is common knowledge and the game could do with some better dialogue but all in all a very enjoyable experience when working properly.\n\nI would like to see the diplomacy improved a bit though (probably already being worked on by the devs) but I just find it a little disconnected for example I'm at war with the Yor, and I open up diplomacy and they talk to me as if we're best friends and yet their status is furious. Things like that take away from the experience, but as I said the Devs are probably already on it.\n\nI would also like to encounter more random things in the galaxy like space born lifeforms etc just to give the game some more depth, suprise and intrigue.\n\nIn it's current state when working properly I'd rate the game a 7.0 out of 10 and that is without a lot of the features in the game being active.","January 8, 2015","true","284.9"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","7"

Only thing I miss is for some of those Terran models that has a hangar door in it to be bent - I'd love to create circular shapes or hangar arms if possible. That is all I'd like to be added.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun enough, but limited due to it still being Beta - some things are however still in 'Alpha' - the AI for one. The planets are nicely detailed, if not a bit lacking in construction. A few more building slots would make it a little more fun and easy.\n\nThe mechanics largely work as well, but saving any custom ships or save the game still does not work properly, and loading a game is impossible, since saving one is equally impossible. But it will be remedied later.\n\nIn overall? I strongly recommend this game to GalCiv fans, and people that enjoy games similar to it - and especially to people that just love or even LIVE the game JUST to design custom ships - or redesign ships from other franchises. But when it comes to buying the game, I say it is up to you.\n\nAdmittedly, given so many core mechanics and side-mechanics are still missing, I have to agree with Waddles the Pig; the game is still in alpha, or late alpha, mostly.\n\nThat is about all I have to say, I think, and anything I've missed will likely be covered by someone else.\n\nI do however really hope that Stardock adds the ability to export and import our custom ship creations, either to use in a different game or in another Civilization, or give it to other players. A bit like mods, I guess - that would be sheer perfection! Ship-sharing!\n\nThis is DanRagr47, signing off!

From the screen shots it looked very pretty and I particulary like the hex maps.  Unfortunately playing the game is a lesson in frustration.\n\nRight from the start, even with habital planets set to abbundant the nearest dozen starts to my starting location have no useable planets.  When I finally can reach the other civs territory they have a lot of planets.  This of course has a massive effect as the game progresses.  They are able to get a lot of planets right out of the gate, which means they get a big boost to every stat.  Looking at the graphs, all of mine have very little growth and theirs sky rocket.\n\nOh and let's talk about how civs will go hostile to you for no reason and reguardless of what your diplomacy is.\n\nThis wasn't just one game, this is every game.  I've restarted several dozen times and it's the same story every time.  I've tried changing the settings from the start and same results.  I can only conclude that either I'm unlucky in the extreme or this sort of thing is done on purpose.\n\nI'm going to unload the game for now and wait for another update and see if anything changes.  For myself this game is just to broken to play and there is no way I'll spend any more money on expansions in the hopes that they somehow compensate.

(such as the moment you build a station, even though there are no ships in the area, they know, and will have it destroyed before you can even buy a fleet enough to defend it from 6 moved away)\n-AI does not yet use resources much. i would like to fight over those rather then blitz their planets\n-easier to use influence to win a war and completely oust a race than to do it by military, too easy.\n-its hard to tell what is the for sure reason for happiness drop on a planet. and too easy to keep your planets happy, at least for me\n-i would like to see some more things affect diplomacy\n\nthats all i can think of for now but will add or take away as the game evolves...\n\nits an awesome game even like 70% or whatever it is finished... i cant wait to see it on full release.\n\nbuy it now, buy it later, you wont be disappointed in the end.\n\n","December 13, 2014","true","16.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

I definitely recommend it to fans of 4X games, and particulary 4X in space, but also recommend being ready for a few bugs as you play it.","August 13, 2015","true","190.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

The gameplay mechanics are archaic, and other games in this genre offer a far more entertaining experience, game is over-priced. Good Studio behind the game, could improve with Future patches.\n\n\n\nI purchased this game very early in development. Why not? It is from a Studio i know, and love.\n\nIn the end, it was the ship-designer that created the Impulse buy. Which stemmed from the desire to play a sandbox/creative space-game. To boot 4x games are by far my favorite genre. I love Endless Space, SotS 1/2, and SoSE, why shouldn't i love this game too?\n\nMany reasons. First off, i find myself only really enjoying the ship design. The game itself is kinda filler, and really unappealing. The races/factions are generic, and provide no real unique experience to play, you will choose races based upon who has the ship designing the elements you want, not because they offer different game-play mechanics, or atmosphere presence. It's the same, watered down game irregardless of the faction.\n\nFrom there, lets talk about game-play. You find yourself only really wanting to end turns to advance research to be able to unlock more items to design in the ship designer. Notice a trend? Yes, the only thing you'll find yourself caring about is the ship designer. -- Combat is terrible, and unentertaining, or interesting. The "Cut-Scene" battles are ackward, glitchy, and unappealing. Plenty of Space 4x games provide amazing cut-scene battles that make every exchange feel immersive, not this game. The animations are jittery, graphics basic, weaponary discharges basic, and overall the experience is painful. Sadly ship design does not really make the ship more combat effective as far as design shape, and part positioning. A ship with 4 lazers is a ship with 4 lazers.\n\nBottomline is i couldn't bare to play this game for too long, nothing pulling me in... when it comes down to ship design other games offer designing to a greater degree, with better graphics, animation, and the design plays a role in combat effectivness, other games provide a better more indepth 4x experience. Those same games are 1/4 the price of this game, and have been in circulation for some time - Bottomline? Get one of those games, not this one.","May 16, 2015","false","24.0"," 28 of 48 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","28","48","3","0"

It has great potential to be played for many of hours. Civ 5 is my alltime favorite and this game is very similiar with city management and not letting it get too complicated. The game still lags bad on my pc and occasionaly will freeze for about 5 mins so best to wait till launch before buying. But in all it is still very fun to play untill the maps and ship counts get so large the system bogs down, then i just tinker in the ship building for awhile. ship building without a tutorial is complicated so i hope that is something they will add at launch but i enjoy crudly pasting peices togethor to make something diffrent. So in short this game is good 7 out of 10 but could be my all time favorite TBS 4X game ever once the bugs and crashes get fixed. Good job everyone working on the game and keep up the good work.\n\nP.S. i dont totally under stand how to post this to the discussions board but a usefull tip would be to add atleast an 1/8th of an inch gap to the rows in the tech menus. them being stacked just makes it fell like your choices are all simialar and being slightly seperated would help that.","March 26, 2015","true","574.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

I had issues before and both times i had help within an hour from a dev to try and help me/them get to the route cause of the problem.

I'm not the complicated type.\n\nAlthough, I was in madlove with GCII and I really enjoy playing GCIII, I have a few reasons that I hope you will not encounter if you ever buy the game.\n\n1.  the A.I. is too predictable, and you usually can tell when you are about to be invaded or declared war upon in let's say 5 to 10 turns beforehand. Which isn't a terribly bad thing if the reason for the invasion weren't: lol scrub u only have 5 ships while i already have 89132589581927 in turn 5 git gud.\n\n2. The game crashes around 6 times at launch before I'm able to play. Too bad all the fun got away in the meantime. Also, after every single crashes or after exiting the game, I always have to go into Task manager and kill every process that might be related to it otherwise everything goes crazy.\n\n3. I still think opting for a military approach is the way to go. Not to say the only way... But that might be me being UNSKILLED.\n\n4.

I've encountered a few nasty game-breaking bugs (with the worst one being unable to load your saved games, though the opt-in beta patch fixes this)and a bunch of balancing issues. Gameplay wise, there are a few things that bother me:\n-Diplomacy is somewhat lackluster, you can't really do anything aside from making trading deals (which also include alliances and the likes) with other factions. I really hope this will become better in the near future, as it - as advertised - should also be a diplomacy-heavy game.\n-No espionage.\n-Issues with the AI. The Drengin Empire seems to disregard upgrading its logistic capabilities, and thus can only field small fleets, even though their ships are pretty powerful. (but due to the lack of logistics are pretty easy to take down) I also noticed that other factions, until they are threatened by war or wishing to start one themselves, have little to no military ships. (and thus, make them easy targets for a military-heavy faction to conquer)\n- The game's a little too easy unless the difficulty is cranked up immensely. (which will give the AI handicap bonuses)\n- Planetary invasion feels weird and shallow.\n\nHowever, these are pretty much my only qualms. Apart from this, the game is absolutely fantastic and a real treat, and is in my opinion, the best 4x game on the market, (only contender would be Endless Space in my opinion) especially when you consider that the game shows a lot of potential to improve and expand in the near future!\n\nFinal verdict: Avid fans of the genre will definetly enjoy it, those who are more skeptical, wait a few months until they flesh out the bugs and improve it a bit.","June 10, 2015","true","36.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

There's a read me in the program files that tells you what to do if you have this issue, so i guess it's something that's been there for a long time and was never properly fixed.

Races feel much less distinct than they did in TotA, game ruining mega-events are still a big problem when you enable the feature (unless you actually enjoy spending 4-5 hours setting up a strategy only for a single pop-up window to make it completely inviable -- though, this is much less of a problem when playing conquest based playstyles), and the planet improvement system, while fundamentally not a bad idea, is extremely tedious to set up for a large number of planets. Finding information when you need it can be extremely annoying, and things can flip around without your notice between turns, leading you to make critical strategic mistakes for no other reason than you were unaware that a statistic changed because you didn't check your diplomacy menu every turn.\n\nI really, REALLY want to like this game.

I don't think it's a great game. It is sometimes fun, sometimes frustrating (as it should be) but what it's not is GalCiv. GalCiv2 was what everyone needed after a long time had passed since MOO2. Obviously, based on that success, fans were expecting another home run with GalCiv3. And what they got was a single.\n\nThere's not much new. If anything, it feels "streamlined" and has less overall "stuff" than GalCiv2 did. That could just be my perspective but I'm certainly feeling less involved this time around. I have mixed feelings about the AI as sometimes it was incredibly smart if not too smart and other times I shook my head in embarassment for them. It just doesn't seem consistent at the mid-to-high difficulty levels.\n\nVisually, which is usually not a 4X game strong point, it's pretty but it's not mind blowing. The game has held my attention for 4 or 5 moderately long sessions so far. I'll play it through a few times but if you're expecting something above and beyond GalCiv2, I just don't feel that it's here.\n\nThat said, this is WAY better than the MOO reboot in Early Access.

This system effects both colonization and diplomacy and helps diversify playthroughs.\n\nHowever this games diplomacy system is very lackluster and very barebones.

Unfortunately, with this game that is not the case. In pre-release videos developers lauded tools that would help players more effectively manage their empires, however this game is filled to the brim with micromanagement once you build the massive empires that the game advertises that you can build. That is, if you can build a large empire. Currently the "large empire happiness penalty" is extremely crippling and really hurts the ability to build the large empires that most people love building in a space game. I don't mind building a small, extremely efficient empire, but if I want to do that, I'll simply play Civ V, because right now that game does that better. People want to play a space 4x because you don't want to have the same constraints as a game like Age of Empires, Civ, or Rise of Nations. Instead, you want to build an empire that has hundreds of planets and hundreds of ships. At this point, it's best to keep playing GalCiv II until they get the game balancing figured out.

A LOT LOT more with those resources and things you can do with them.\n\nh. A lot more with regards to gray market, black market and kind of quasi-war stuff (read up on the 1790s for more info).\n\ni. A lot more with invasions, espionage, funding opposition, destabilizing, inciting rebellions.\n\nj. A lot more on serious galactic events.\n\nk. More satisfying fleet battles both visually and how the player can feel more control over them (not tactical battles but giving more priorities to things).\n\nl. A lot more technology options to allow players to play the game differently (this is an offshoot of the cabinet concept and political party concepts but rather has to do with being able to recruit personnel to "get things done" for you on things you don't want to micro manage).\n\nThat's just a few of the things off the top of my head."\n\nThe game works and is still playable aside from some bugs, low FPS, and the screen freezing on turns.

If they optimize the game and integrate some new features like steam workshop, espionage, etc. it will have more re-play value. Otherwise, it is like a rehash of GalCiv II as many owners point out.\n\nIf you want to buy the game anyway, I suggest you watch some let's plays and dev team twitch live streams, look through the Galciv forums, and ask some owners of the game on steam what they like and dislike about it first before purchasing the game.","May 18, 2015","true","52.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

I am SO glad I didn't pay pay more for this.\n\nUnderstand, the game itself is beautiful, ther are are some nice gameplay mechanics, some other are missing (experience for ships), but overall it is a nice experience and you have fun playing the game, and you may even end up still playing at 5am because the time passes well.\n\nBUT\n\nOne year after its release and there are still so many bugs ??? Right now I haven't been able to finish even one game without seing a bug. And I'm not talking about some minor glitches, but really crashes. If I'm lucky, it will just be a crash to the desktop. If I'm unlucky, the game will mess my drivers and the whole system will hang, requiring a hard reboot.\nCrashes when ejecting ships, invading planets, and now the last one that made me write this review, crash in the ship designer when selecting a ship model.\n\nMost programs have crash handler, or some sort of window popping up, asking if they can report the bug, but on this game the game simply crashes, to windows, no "crash" window popup, and only a good firewall will warn you that the process tries to submit a bug report =_=.\n\nSo yes, there are savegames usually a few turns before it happens and if I remember which elements of the UI crash, I can avoid using them. But seriously this is annoying. Restarting the game and loading a savegame and replaying missing turns. At the time of writing, I have played 14 hours, and I've probably wasted more than one hour because of those bugs.\n\nMaybe this only happens because I'm playing with somewhat high graphics preset (GTX 860M), but it's not a reason. I shouldn't be told to play with lower res graphics because high-res graphics make the game crash - that's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I have avoided buying early so I could enjoy the game -- not to be hired as beta tester.\n\nI hope they make good use of those crash reports they send in the background...","February 13","false","25.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I had really high expectations, and during the beta it showed a lot of promise.  Then when it released it seemed like things just fell apart.  The multiplayer was broken, and still is limited.  Features that existed and functioned well in beta disapeared.  SInce release it seems like a 2 steps forward 1 step back approach is being implemented on the updates.  For every 2 advances in stability or gameplay features we get an update that fundamentally changes the game.  The most recent example of this is the 1.4.2 beta patch.  It promises us more advanced AI and easier management of your empire.  And I suppose it achieves this by eliminating the player ability to micromanage their planets.  Having your planetary governing skills labotomized would make the AI appear to be harder and also simplfies the managing of your empire, but it is done so by taking away a very powerful resource held by every human player, the ability to use ones intelect and planning to stregnthen ones own position.  Now I have every hope that the developers of this game would see the angst bestowed upon the paid customers of this game and remedy this situation.  But until things are fixed and updates stop attempting to take away from the player, I cannot say I am glad that I bought this game and therefor cannot recconmend it.  I hope one day to be able to change my review to positive, but for now it just remains my hope.","October 16, 2015","false","242.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

In it's current beta state it's still a bit buggy (however I left it running overnight for 8 hours and then returned to play, so it doesn't get worse over time, just how beta-stage games are), never crashed on me. If you were a fan of Gal Civ II, then this is definitively a continuation of that game and the few new mechanics introduced already make a positive difference.\n\nI particularly enjoy the feature of choosing sponsors for shipyards, which makes them much more effective facilities that do not require extensive infrastructure or research. The graphics aren't dramatically different (which I actually like), they're just cleaner and clearer. The core gameplay mechanics haven't been altered either, which I like as well (the method through which starbases are upgraded remained the same, planets still have the grid), they really retained a lot of Gal Civ II, making the game very easy to pick up after not having played in years. Needless to say they didn't try fixing anything that wasn't broken to begin with, like many other companies do with the sequels of their most successful games.","October 11, 2014","true","43.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It is an upgrade in almost every way to GalCiv2. I've had the entire family playing it, even 5 and 7 year old girls building dragons, dancing robots and beautiful bugs in the ship designer (and laughing a lot). Still has room for more features and expansions, but there's already plenty to sink your teeth into.\n\nMy personal list of improvements in GalCiv3:\n1. Planet buildings now have adjacency bonuses. The screen feels familiar to anyone who's played GalCiv while adding a new mechanic that makes it important not just what you build but where you build it.\n\n2. The ship designer. It's easy to make and animate some very pretty things (bugs, transformers etc.). Star Trek ships can already be seen on the forums and I'm sure once the game is in a final state and hooked-up to steamworks it won't be long before there'll be lots of fun total conversion mods to choose from.\n\n3. The Developers have been doing weekly twitch streams showing the latest build and talking through their grand plan for the game, balance, bugs, updates and future features. It's up to 47 videos in the youtube playlist each ~45mins long +/- 10 mins. Some laggy/framedrops/audio problems at times but still very informative.\n\n4. Resources, they're big and fun now. You can find them on planets (e.g. snuggler colonies), in place of planets (thulium), in asteroid fields (durantium), orbiting black holes (antimatter) or hiding in nebulae (elerium). Each has benefits:\nPlanetside - they let you build special buildings with powerful effects and adjacency bonuses\nDiplomatically  - you can trade them\nStrategically - you can turn them into prototype guns/hyperdrives/etc for your favourite capital ships.\n\n5. More race options. The old 'super-abilities' from GalCiv2 have now become 2 (still quite super) abilities. So you have even more ways of mixing and matching for your perfect race. That's in addition to the % modifiers. Also you now have the ability to change your home system and tech tree for custom races (without having to fiddle with xml).\n\n6+. Everything else:\nHexes rather than squares, upgrade to 64-bit so bigger and better maps. Unique tech-trees as standard. Bigger and better cutscenes. More animated backgrounds, portraits, gizmos, doodads and thingamajigs. More epic fleet battles. Shipyards draw resources from multiple planets (less hassle). Chris Bucholz (new writer extraordinaire on the team from Cracked.com, improving whatever he touches).\n\nThe Bad:\n1. Micromanagement on larger maps is a chore, additional features to reduce the hastle would be greatly appreciated. More information at a glance, more ways to group/sort/view planets together, mark important features (what is this planet's highest % bonus?) what is/will be my plan for this world?\n\n2. You'll have to wait for a future expansion to get admirals and xp, planet-killers and spies. Not entirely a bad thing. I'm glad some features were pushed to a future later date to make sure that everything gets the time and attention to detail that it deserves.\n\n3. Needs a big balance pass. Lots of tiny (but significant) adjustments, and some time to play the game and work out what is needed for everything to settle into more comfortable values.\n\nExamples:\n3a. The large empire approval penalties being too strong on large maps, making race abilities like patriotic (which negates the penalty) equally strong. (They were % based which broke the game when it reached 100% penalty. Flat now, but still a problem at high values)\n3b. Planetary projects/special buildings being a little too fiddly and confusing. Is it better to set the slider to 100% wealth or use a project to convert excess manufacturing? Is it better to build a factory or a resource refinery? Sometimes you need access to a spreadsheet to see what should be obvious, since you have to factor in build-times and stacking % bonuses from different sources.\n3c. Exploits like 'ancient' giving 10% research per relic, quickly reaching 10x the research rate of other races once you gain a handful of relics(+%) and ascension crystals (+raw research).\n3d. Sensor ranges for ships/planets/starbases aren't balanced against each other. (Blind starbases and planets, with all-seeing cargo-scouts).\n\nBut all of the above require tweaking the odd number from +2 to +3 or adding caps/diminishing returns where appropriate. Easy to fix by 1.1.\n\n\nConclusion:\nA game with big boots to fill, and lots of room to grow. But it's already an improvement graphically and mechanically over its predecessor. I hope you try it and have fun with it. Have a look at the developers twitch streams if you're not sure or are interested in the growth of the game - the videos can also be found on youtube by searching for Stardock Games.","October 7, 2014","true","232.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It just feels like it was released too early...\n\nIt hurts to write this review. I really looked forward to this game and had hoped the best for it, but I cannot recommend this game for the full price in its current state. The game feels like it should not have been released this early, there is a lack of polish in many of the options and features. If you look through these review you will see that many other players have said all of this better than I could say.\n\nLack of diplomacy, spying, in-game help for many of the mechanics are frustrating. The constructor-spam situation is real and very annoying right now. I read about this from a handful of others and thought they were just being touchy, but having played a couple of games now it is a very real thing. Other players build starbases in your territory, stealing your resources and you can do nothing about this unless you want to start a war; you cannot even complain about this on the diplomacy screen! The enemy seems to keep fleets of constructors that just rush right to every resource location right from the start...\n\nI could go on, but I strongly suggest anyone that is thinking about picking up this game look at what the other reviewers have had to say and take it to heart.\n\nNow, it does look like the company is working to fix these problems, but who knows how long this will really last or where it will end up. I personally wish I would have waited for next year to buy this game and would suggest that potential buyers delay their purchase until many more patches come out and see where this game ends up.\n\nI think I am going to delay playing this game and come back to it after several patches and see the state of it then.

You wouldn't think too many is bad but it is. They all are so similar.  Honestly, the tech tree could be cut down by 2/3s. Most of the techs are forgetable as you just click next your next research goal without really thinking of what you just discovered. Many of them are just filler until you get the one that actually has a benefit. The devs should have taken the lead from Civ V. The tech tree was excellent. Every tech you discover gave you something.\nAnother problem with having so many techs is the benefits you get when they do pop up are so minor as to be unimportant - 1+ food, 1+ research, meh. This is similar to the problem that plagued beyond earth.\n\nIf I had one wish, it would be for a pared down tech tree with significant beneits gained with each discovery - in the vane of Civ V.\n\n(2) Diplomacy is so boring. It's hard to believe but Civ V's diplomacy is better. For one, making any agreement is a chore. IF you offer something for trade you can't just click a button to say what would you give me for this like in Civ V, you have to go by trail and error to finally find something they'll trade you. I just gave up.\n\nAlso, most of the interactions from the AI are either them begging for money or telling you they're unhappy or happy about open borders.\n\nThere is the odd taunt but you can never give it back to them as in Civ V.\n\nI was expecting much, much more with diplomacy given Gal Civ's history and it being from Stardock. I am very disappointed.\n\n\nThere are fun parts of the game, certainly tweaking the position of your buildings to get the optimum bonuses is fun. The exploring and settling part is good too as are the ideologies.\n\nUnfortunatley, overall the game doesn't do it for me. I was surprised they didn't take more ideas from how Civ V did things to really make Gal Civ III shine. I keep coming back to CIv V because there are so many great things Firaxis did to make that game accessable, fun, and easy to play. Stardock certainly could have brought over some of the ideas. I mean there isn't even an option to have the game automatically end your turn. You always have to click the button.\n\nI really, really, wanted to love this game but I can't recommend it.\n\nShort review:\n\n(1) Tech tree is too expansive and the individual techs are forgetable.\n\n(2) Diplomacy is worse than CIv V.\n\n(3) Exploring is fun as is settling your planet as is optimizing your building position.\n\nI don't recommend it, unfortunately. The game has been uninstalled.\nSorry Stardock - I'm still a fan and I hope you can fix it.","June 9, 2015","false","32.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

So as more of a casual coming into Galactic Civilization 3 I didn't know what to expect due to the numerous comments on the learning curve and crashes/bugs.\n\nI will have to say that the game isn't too hard to pick up honestly. I've played far more difficult games as far as entry level is concerned (Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis 4). The tutorial campaign could use a little more polish to teach you some of the more unexplained nuances, which sadly there is a lot of. For example, it doesn't explain very well ship roles. It also doesn't explain the more intricate part of starbases and just how important they actually are.\n\nBut really I was off and racing experimenting with a few practice games and I also picked up a few tips outside of the game online. However that doesn't mean I have become by all means excellent. I feel like I am picking up new techniques and research build orders everytime I play. In addition to that the difficulty does seem really challenging even on normal. I am very calculated and careful in my play yet the AI always seem to end up leaps and bounds ahead and this is usually due to the fact that faction power is calculated largely off of ships you have on the map at any one stage.\n\nThe game runs very smoothly for the most part. I have a decent gaming rig with and SSD, 16Gb Ram and a GTX960 and the graphics are nice and smooth, however I feel it does need a little optimization. For example when scrolling the map especially on large and above maps with the anti-aliasing tunred up and draw grid map enabled there are little pauses here and there. So bare in mind it is good but not perfect. Lowering the AA down to 4 or 2 especially for large maps and above is pretty useful to iron out the tiny half second lag you get on large and above maps. However having said all that it's a treat looking over the bright star and nebula filled galaxies in the game. Turns in later games and on larger maps are pretty quick too so far (now about 18 hours into it). Granted I haven't started a super huge map loaded with races just yet but I aim to do that in the near future.\n\nThe honey moon period is starting to wear off the game but so far it's still okay, honestly this game can keep me glued to the computer for hours. I don't even realise sometimes how much time has passed. If a game can do that to you, then it's clearly a good game right? The game has a great ship creator (love the 3D printing support by the way - regardless of me not having a 3D printer).\n\nThe depth of the game really comes from the way you pick your research and how you manage your resources and planets and diplomacy and a little more annoyingly starbase management too. It is a fun game and I could honestly if it weren't for kids and work sit there for hours and let the days and months dwindle away until I have completed a huge map and emerge from my cave soiled and hairy.\n\nAnyways give the game a go, the developers are great and are working closely with the Community to better develop the game. I have however become skeptical of the price of the DLC vs actual content. This does feel al little over the top to pay $5 for "events". The game is no doubt fun but I see many online starting to call out Stardock on their DLC content. Give it a go you may just become addicted like I have!\n\nUPDATED: 17/03 - To reflect my current thoughts after giving the game a more decent amount of time.","November 21, 2015","true","26.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","4","4","3","0"

Each game played has been a different experience - although my personal play style seems to keep pushing me toward diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe visuals are great, though the some of face animation in cutscenes leaves something to be desired.   The sound is not bad.  But really, it is all about the game play and customizability which will allow this game to have long-lasting value.   And the AI is capable of beating you if you are not paying attention.  This makes the game challenging and fun as you react to decisions made by AI factions.  For this and tremendous customizability (and scale) of the game, I consider the game well worth the value, especially of you are the type that likes to tinker and customize your experience.\n\nIt is, of course, not without its faults.\n- Now that the campain is released, I find it underwhelming.  I was looking forward to a deeper story and more than a few maps.  I understand that more will be added in the future.  However, the present campaign is thin and lacks the drama that the trailers seemed to promise.\n- The game still has a range of random typos, mismatches in what a few techs or improvements say and what they actually do, to go along with the rare crash (rare for me, anyway).\n- The cinematic battle viewer is great in concept,... except for when suddenly it choses an angle that isn't showing anything at all.  I guess a camera person fell asleep.\n\nYes, some of these problems are annoying.  But I think what will make this game endure and makes it well worth the price is that it can be played, replayed, and played with for a long time.  With easy mod creation, it will not be long before there are many quality mods to enhance play.  Because ship parts can animate, the creative among us can create "transforming" ships.  The game is as much about being space emperor as it is about the game within the game (the customization of it).\n\nPeople looking for a deep engrossing story will be disappointed.  But people looking who like building ships, making designs, making new races, and playing with all your created toys... (people like me) will be able to play this thing for a long long time.","April 28, 2015","true","402.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","4"

The the planets are spread out on the map as cities, and stars, asteroids and other bodies act as other kind of terrain. The ridiculous scales bother me more than little, but not enough to make me hate the games. I think this game is mediocre. It's not bad, but doesn't do anything that other space 4X games don't do better. Reasonably smooth, but unimpressive.\n\nSome are bothered by the fact that you can't control the tactical combats. I am not, though I would prefer bit more detailed standing orders and setting formations beforehand. Now you just set the ship role as you design the class and that's it. Ship design isn't that impressive either if you don't care that much about the cosmetic aspect of it.\n\nNevertheless, the game was good enough to get me on "one more turn" state at least for a while, so it's not all that bad. If you are a big fan of turn based space 4X games, this might be worth a look. I would recommend waiting for the price to drop first, though.

Galactic Civilization II was one of the greatest strategy games of all time for me so I was a bit worried and stoked all at the same time for the new game. The good news is that fans of the past games will enjoy this 3rd game in the series and that some new players might like it aswell!\n\nThere is TONS of customization in this game and the maps can be HUGE HUGE HUGE HUGE! If you like 4x strategy games or space games or stardock games from the past check this one out!  The graphics are nice, the gameplay is fun and like always in stardock games there are alot of options for customization/modding.\n\n5 hours into the game so far and my experience is 98% positive! Had one small bug but that is really the only negative I have atm! Pick up this new stardock Galactic Civilization 3 game and start taking over all the planets and kick some aliens butt! Feel like creating your own faction from scratch? You can do it in this, customize anything from spaceships design, whole factions,etc...\n\nWhat is here now is a wonderful base game that I hope gets a good expansion pack like Galactic Civilization 2 had. Stardock imo is the best at these 4x Strategy games, they nailed it with Galactic Civilization 1 and 2 years ago, did an awesome job on Fallen Enchantress Legendary Heroes and of course the wonderful Sins of A Solar Empire series that Ironclad and Stardock work on.\n\nIn the end if you are wondering if this is new one can measure up to the old ones or not.... The answer is its more great GC from stardock and its very much worth checking out if you don't mind a slight learning curve and don't mind your social life getting destroyed! (This has the "JUST ONE MORE TURN!!!" feeling of Civilization games and good 4x strategy games of the past).\n\nNow back to my game as Spock and his faction as we try to take over the world!

You are NOT required to play or even touch the alpha, I have played it twice and honestly I am so good, from my long history with GC series that the AI usually doesn't last more than 20 turns, since there is nothing more to do other than wipe them out, the alpha can get quite boring, quite quickly.

Sure enough one came, and even added multiplayer to it.\n\n4X games aren’t overly popular due to the fact you take turns. In the case you are playing multiplayer, this could mean you will probably have the chance to go and make coffee before their turn is over.\n\nAction is certainly not a descriptor for games like these. If you have played Sid Meier’s Civilizations VI or V, you should feel right at home. There are quite a few similarities between the two titles, but there are the differences.\nRight off the bat, the tech tree in Gal Civ is much, much, much larger. Trading technology has its advantages, as trade does in general.\n\nThe difference in scale is also very apparent. Setting a requirement of a 64-bit operating system to handle the much larger maps/universes was viewed to be a necessity by many (including myself). Those without Windows XP will find themselves unable to play as well because of the Direct X 10 requirement.

But this newest version adds almost nothing to what Civ 2 had, leading me to wonder why this game was given a 3rd iteration if a creative spark was lacking.\n\nThe interface is similar to galactic civ 2 in that the majority of the vital text necessary for gameplay is crammed at the bottom and left-hand edge of the screen. When one invents a wondrous new engine or social policy we are greeted with a gigantic picture of a server bot doing a repetitive hand display with the actual description of the invention a few terse sentences at the bottom of the screen as if it were an afterthought. Shouldn't the flavor text and practical statistics of a new discovery take precedent over a server bot? We have to look at this guy for hours and hours of gameplay.\n\nMore summaries are needed. Granted I do not mind sifting through Excel-like spreadsheets to feel clever about discerning a new way to refine my galactic macroeconomics, but a quick rundown is often necessary just to get a better jist of a planet's well-being, especially when the player is embroiled in chaotic conflicts with one or more opponents. The entire UI text is too small and ignored throughout.\n\nOn the subject of combat, I have yet to design a ship that consistently wins battles. This may be some sort of personal failing of mine, but I am having trouble figuring out what I should or should not do. Range on mass drivers seems limited, which makes no sense in the vacuum of space, and other races always seem to evolve faster than myself, as if they were optimally programmed to know exactly what to do or something. How strange! Granted additional time spent with the game will probably find me honing in on workable strategies, I have to note that playing several hundred turns into a game only to then find that my plan was flawed is depressing. A few failed attempts at various weapons and engines with  little learned on how to improve has discouraged me from wishing to replay.\n\nThe relatively underdeveloped story does not allow me to enjoy the wonder of exploring a universe with any given race. Is it expensive to pay writers to add additional depth and creativity to a game? I honestly don't know, but I would be willing to forgive my military failures if I could at least love the universe a bit more.","June 2, 2015","false","23.1"," 24 of 43 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","24","43","0","1"

Could they add enough to the game to make it fresh without spoiling what made GalCiv2 great? Could they deliver a game that exceed the golden memories of GC2?\n\nYes. And they did.\n\nThe core of the game remains much the same. Your fledgling empire starts, isolated and alone in an unknown galaxy. Move quickly, colonize new worlds, research new technologies, raise a fleet of warships and crush your enemies into powder. Or sooth them with diplomacy.

First of all, I love Galactic Civ 2. I think it was and arguably still is one of if not the best 4X TBS games, and I have 1000+ hours in it. I did buy the $99.99 elite edition so I get all of the DLC and expansions free, so I still have hope.\n\nUnfortunately, GC3 just isn't as fun. I have many problems with the game; here are a few that really annoy me.\n\n1. Economy/Hapiness- This is the one thing I really hate about GC3. In GC2 managing the economy, taxes and production capacity was one of my favorite parts of the game. It's all gone. Tax rate can not be adjusted, instead you only get the wheel to adjust where spending goes. Hapiness also sucks now. For example, I was playing on largest size map. I was suffering from large empire penalty, an awful addition, and was building two stadiums per planet to maintain hapiness. Finally, I just stopped caring. My global hapiness dropped to 7%, with most planets at 0%. Guess what happened? Absolutely nothing. Planets are supposedly more suceptible to invasion and grow slower, but not a single one leaves. In GC2, you would literally die if you did this. One time in GC2 I changed tax rate from 39% to 100% for one turn to bail our my economy, and my citizens literally killed me, taking 119 of my 120 planets, leaving my relpacement I played as with a clsss 4 and half a fleet.\n\n2. Pacing- Somehow this is pure awful also. I am 250 turns into a game, and havent met a single other civ. I dont think exploration was changed; what changed is how long turns take. All units must have orders, and this doubles turn length. In GC2, I could get through 50 turns in 5 minutes if I wasn't at war. In GC3, I would be lucky to get 50 turns out in an hour. The era lock on technologies is also bad, making all civs make mearly identical research choices.\n\n3. AI/War- GC2 has an amazing AI. Better than the AI from any other strategy game I have seen since or before. GC3 throws this legacy away and instead goes in the direction of CIv V's AI (Not that Civ IV had great AI, and Civ V is good enough that I have 2000+ hours on it) aand is awful. Especially in warfare, AIs are completely incompetent. GC2 Ais were on par with me most games, but GC3 AIs suck at politics completely.\n\n4. Ideology- While I very much like the concept, many policies need to be curbed or removed. There is a neutral on tthe FIRST level that makes it so you cant declare war on whoever gets it for 50 turns(about an hour of gameplay) which I hate, especially because minor races will always take it and other majors as well righht as you are about to invade them. Many others are overpowered; for example a malevolent one gives 5 transports, which have 6b population each. At the point of the game you can get it, this literally doubles your population if you land them.\n\nThere are other things that annoy me as well, but theses are the most game breaking. If the devs want to fix this game, they should:\n-Re-Implement GC2 economy features\n-Remove large empire penalty for all civs- May be why many races stay small and never meet you\n-Let players end turn if units need orders\n-Fix AI- Need to be way more agressive and expansionist\n-Rebalance economy\n\nAll in all, I do think that this will eventually be a really fun game. As for now, GC2 is better. If you are considering buying this, instead go for GC2. It is really modern despite it's age, even supporting 1920x1080 resolution, though the UI is dated.","June 22, 2015","false","188.5"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

Far too many words for not only the attention span of the average reader, but even more words than a Steam review can allow. So let me sum it up: Bad AI, unpredictable game bugs from minor to game breaking, plus everything mentioned below. Honestly, this game was at a: "Don't buy until on sale", but after putting more hours into it (and then rage quitting because of a daftly mind boggling stupid bug that made me uninstall the game in anger) I am now just saying: Avoid this game until it has plenty of patches. Don't trust this developer to deliver quality. I should have known from the beginning when they launched the early access at $99 that this game was a sham and a rip off. I'm still kicking myself - a week later - that I bought this game at $50. Terrible, terrible purchase.\n\nOriginal review below:\n\nI'm having a hard time getting into this game.\nFor most 4x games, particularly the Civ series, 2 hours is way more than enough for the game to sink it's hooks in and keep me going for "just one more turn!"\n\nIt's easy to draw similarities between the Civ franchise and Galactic Civilizations III, partly because "Civilizations" is in it's title, but it is also a 4x game with similar rulesets as the Civ franchise, which maybe is where I am having trouble getting in to it.\nCiv5 made it easy to pick up and play. While it's not without it's bugs (especially at launch) some of the basic fundamentals seems refined.\nGCIII, on the other hand, seems to have clunky controls which is the bare-bones basics of all games. The UI often provides too much unnecessary information at times, while at other times, it doesn't seem to give you enough feedback (like when building on a planet)\n\n***EDIT***\nbelow I mention using directional keys to move the camera bugs when selected on a ship. This isn't entirely true. After checking key-mapping, it turns out the W and the S key were mapped to 2 items, resulting in the seemingly weird bug. This comes back to my complaint about the UI not providing enough information. It would have been nice if the game informed me there was another function already mapped to those keys.\n\nThe camera - which I map to WASD - is picky. I can move it freely while I am NOT selected on any ship or planet, but should I select one, it locks my camera to the X axis, preventing any vertical scrolling. As for movement paths themselves - going back to the UI not providing enough feedback at times - when you tell a ship to auto move (either to your predefined location or just setting it to auto-explore) it seems like any action, big or small, while the unit is selected, will set the ship to idle and remove it's auto-path.\n\nRace customization seems almost pointless. Aesthetically, there are very limited options to chose from - unless you want still images, which I find un-immersive. It does provide some RPG-esque stats to try and specialize your race in certain areas, but I found it to be so inconsequential. You only get 5 points to distribute, and since this is not an RPG - as far as I am aware - you do not get any more stat points to distribute.\nWhile you could intentionally REMOVE points from existing areas to get more than the 5 stat points, it always feels like if you want to properly specialize your race you have to intentionally hinder your race. Honestly, It feels like it has the illusion of a deep stat system, but frankly, I think a basic "Choose 2 specializations and choose 1 weakness" from a small list of trees like, "Research, Commerce, Growth, Warfare, Politics" would have provided a more meaningful choice than the existing "specialization tree".\n\nShip building is a fine example of how clunky controls can be in this game. It feels like an almost direct copy-paste job of the ship building in GCII, and it has not aged well.\nThere is NO undo/redo option. There is NO copy-paste option. As far as I am aware, there is NO save and edit later function. When you have as many functions to control objects shape, size, appearance, and animation, the lack of the above listed utilities is a huge disappointment on Stardock. This makes repeating similar pieces for symmetry's sake tedious as hell with no copy paste. And if you use the gizmo's to control rotation, translation, and size, then it is very easy to accidentally click on a different piece than the one you are editing and wind up adjusting the wrong piece, which can result in screwing up the ship and without Ctrl-Z to undo, it can be astoundingly frustrating.\nThe use of snap-points for pieces also seems archaic, and often, getting the piece you want to snap to the points is a headache in it of itself, but more often than not, these snap points don't seem to want to work in your favor anyways. Often it seems like objects want to snap to the most illogical placement, such as clipping inside the object it snapped to, and usually with weird rotations.\nI feel like a drag-and-drop system or a click-on system (without snap points) would have been more effective, but, without it, as a result, the ship-building is just a headache.\n\nI came into this game hoping to experience a Sci-Fi equivilent to Civilizations with extensive customization, but I left feeling like I was burned by a bad game with poor, clunky controls, an uninfomative UI, and shallow, frustrating customization.

If only you knew half of what this game went through in the beta. The devs really kicked butt and got a mountain of good work done in the month before release.\n\nJust as with GalCiv 2 before it, the spaceship designer is the best part about this game - like playing with a customizeable box of Legos, you can take pieces from anything in the game at all, resize them, stretch them, double them along both lines of symmetry, move the lines of symmetry to wherever you want, and animate anything. That's not to say the default designs aren't amazing -- heck, they're so good, you could go the whole game using just the default designs and never feel bad about it, but the personal touch you get from designing your own ship will make you excited to play future games, where you know exactly what techs you need to start making those ships (the designs stay with you until you delete them).\n\nObviously, this isn't just a spaceship designer, it's a space 4x, and it is a deserving successor of the GalCiv franchise. Everything is bigger, better, and with more room for expansion. The move up to 64 bit allowed the devs to go nuts with features, and even more stuff is on the way. Best of all, GalCiv 3 is easy to mod, and mod support is better than ever. Don't like the default balance? Changing it is as easy as opening an XML and changing a few numbers. Once it gets integrated into the Steam Workshop, the floodgates will open. Make an awesome ship design and want to share it with the world? Do it.\n\nI honestly didn't think this game would be ready in time when I saw the release date.

I've played all of the previous Galactic Civ series and all of the Master Orions before that. This is the succcessor to those and it shows.  While the game is still in beta, it certainly playable and new things are being finished/adjusted and added regularly. Going to 64 bit only has really allowed them to make immense glaxay settings available, so much so that you can't get all of the possible galaxy on a 1920x1080 monitor at once. :)\n\nMany things are similar or familar but with tweaks. Most obvious first change is that the game map is now hexagon based. The tech trees are per race, and there are big differences per race. As another reviewer noted, it's easier to build your colonies with automated updates, but as they now give bonuses for similar neighbooring improvements so careful  planning can be game changing.\n\nYou have significant off planets things to mine or harvest- asension crystals, artifacts, resources and asteriods (although asteroid mining isn't implemented as of Beta 4). Grabbing these can also make a large difference in the game, depending on your play style.\n\n6 or 7 different ways to triumph, including a turn limit/overall score mode, make this version potentially superior to the previous ones replayibility and variety.\n\nThe beta isn't polished or complete, but is worth having. Oh, did I mention multiplayer? Haven't tried it yet, but should be interesting to see how they keep it moving.\n\nBuy this. The nice thing is that Stardock has a great history of continuing development (not just bug fixes) way past the point more rational developers would start making the next version. You can tell that this a labor of love.","March 5, 2015","true","843.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

TLDR; I'd recommend if you are a serious fan of 4x space games or a gal civ fan, but not for most people (yet)\n\nSo what are the positives?\n++The game has far finer control for making custom races\n+The ship creator is much more detailed\n+++The mechanic of ships having roles is actually pretty interesting (if a bit weird to figure out at first)\n+++The addition of space resources to harvest for powerful buildings and ship weaponry and fleet boosting modules is pretty awesome and can really change the way the game plays out\n++The wide number of tech trees makes custom races feel more unique, and each race feels more unique for the tech trees\n+Space combat is pretty interesting both due to a large number of support modules and ship roles.\n+The new space ports (which i hated at first) have grown on me. Now you can build big vessels by focusing five worlds together, which means that those massive vessels late game won't take 150 turns to build.\n+More support buildings make it easier to specialize worlds and create more powerful empires earlier on.\n+++The new morality system is much more rewarding than the old system, as it grants you bonuses in every alignment based on how many points you spend in each area. It really makes your empire feel like the sum of its choices instead of just paying money to change alignment.\n\n\nNow for the negatives\n---Planetary invasions are as dull as dishwater. There are no battle scenes, rather you just look at the planet to find out your odds. This needs MASSIVE support to fix.\n---Still no customization of invasion forces. I would love to see it set up so you could choose how you want your invasion forces to look (even something simple like 30% infantry, 25% Heavy vehicles, 15% anti air, 30% air support would be a nice improvement in my opinion).\n---Diplomacy is god awful in this game. No matter how close you are to a race, if they are stronger than you, they will attack you. It doesn't matter how many fleets you destroy with your super vessel, as long as their combined stats are higher than yours, then they don't care. I built, for example, a ship with over 400 stats in every offensive and defensive role, and could wipe out entire enemy fleets with every turn using that ship. I was destroying them as quickly as they could spam them, however, so the AI never let me sue for peace. Pretty broken mechanic imo.\n--I wish you had the option that no player can build anything in another's ZOC. It really ticks me off that the AI keeps building starbases in my territory, then I have to either bribe them to give it to me, go to war with them, or accept that I can't have those resources, which really sucks.\n--The campaign seems like a boring tutorial more than the in-depth fun storylines they used to be.\n\nSo overall do I recommend this game? Yes, I do. If you are a fan of stardock, gal civ, or are a huge fan of space 4x games. But unless you fall into one of those categories, I would recommend you try out Gal Civ 2 first, and wait for more support on this game. The good news is they plan on supporting Gal Civ 3 for a long time, so I am sure these issues will be addressed.\n\n****UPDATE FEB 2016****\n\nNow I left the original review up there for a reason. I want to show the known issues of the time versus the new ones. So it has been several months, and I have to say I am borderline upset at how little progress has been made with core components of the game that I would think would be high priority. But first, some new complaints altogether:\n\n---They removed the better ability to control a planet's output. When I wrote my original review, they had a system where there was essentially a production wheel, almost like a color wheel in MS paint, and you could choose exactly where to put production. So maybe planet A was 26% production, 32% research, and 42% economy, while planet B could be 48% production, 48% research, 4% economy. They have since REMOVED that feature, and gone back to civ 2's mechanic of choosing where to focus, but with no fine control. This deserves a special mention since they actually removed a fantastic upgrade, all in the name of "simplifying" the game. There is, to my knowledge, no way to re-enable it.\n\n--- You can not adjust the freaking sound sliders mid game without restarting the game. Seriously? It may have been there before, but I never noticed it until now. How can a game made by a reputable company have this kind of issue?\n\nNow, the other reasons I am upset with stardock:\n5+ months later, military invasions are still just "look at the odds and decide if you want  to attack or not". This is a massive DOWNGRADE from the previous entry in the series, and the fact that they have still not addressed it shows a lack of any interest to fix it anytime soon, despite how lack-luster it is.\n\nDiplomacy is still identical. Any race you encounter will attack you if you are considered weaker than you, regardless of who they are. This means that relatively peaceful races in the game, including the religious ones, will just outright attack you for being weaker.This just seems so wrong. Other than that, there is no change from Gal Civ 2, so there is not much else to say, outside of it is disappointing.\n\nThe AI will still build bases in your territory, with not even a toggleable option to change their ability to do it. See my above review to get the general idea.\n\nThe AIs also still just build into massive debt. They just keep producing units, and go quickly bankrupt. Imagine if america suddenly multiplied their military budget by a 1000 fold, and you get the idea of what they do. But of course, these are usually weaker units, and your ships can ususally take them out by the fleet later on. This means that you get stuck in wars that go no-where, as they just spam to keep their numbers up, while you destroy as quickly as you can, making little progress. Since you can only dent their fleets temporarily, you will find it hard getting peace treaties if they get too large, just because tanking their military rating will be so hard.\n\nAnd of course, we have to talk about the DLC. They have all these issues, but they keep releasing more DLC. in the five months between my original review and the current one, they released two new DLCs, but so many big issues that I have outlined multiple times (both in this review and in comments made to the devs in discussion boards) seem to go unnoticed/ unresolved. I did not expect this from Stardock, and I am thoroughly disgusted by it.\n\nSo overall, I am changing my review to no, not recommended, unless you are a massive stardock fan, and the issues above do not bother you. The game seems to be making no real progress, unless you want to buy DLC, and that seems to be their focus. The military is bland when it comes to ground forces, and the diplomacy is down-right attrocious. I was willing to overlook those issues in my old review because I had seen the game making positive gains, and I did make sure to note that there was still a lot of work to be done. But now that the game seems to have stalled on progress for DLCs and other cash grabs, I can not recommend this game. If they start making good changes and fix the bigger issues I have mentioned, then I will revisit my review and will give them credit. Until then, however, you have lost a customer here Stardock.

I really enjoy playing this game, and it has some very good features. These include and are not limited to extraordinary graphics and a built-in ship designer that is second to none, as well as faction creation that is excellent. There is also a very nice feature that allows play on smaller maps if you have a lower powered computer, so that you aren't locked out of the game just because you don't have a top of the line gaming machine.\n\nThere are a few big flaws: first, there needs to be a reset to defaults button, badly. After playing a number of games, your galaxy setup will probably be way off from the start, and this can be a problem if your games have been going in the wrong direction and you want to backtrack without losing customized ship designs and the like. Second, there needs to be more options for the type of galaxy in a meaningful way. Although there are multiple galaxy types, in reality the planetary and star distribution don't have signifcant differences except in two cases, especially in smaller maps.\n\nOn the whole, I would recommend this game to anybody looking for creative ship design, a generally good play experiece, beautiful graphics, and the patience to work around the flaws.","April 8","true","242.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I have fond memories of previous installations of this series and I was immediately rewarded with enjoyment and relatively bug-free gameplay from day one of install. I have been a pre-release backer of this game for a good while, and I almost uniformly hate pre-release games and early release iterations of the "finished" product. This game, however, is an exception.\n\nI spent my first half-hour post-release immediately building a custom civilization, modding in leader foreground and profile pictures and generally tinkering with the galaxy and opponent settings. I love the customizability of the game, the depth of scope is up to you, the density of worlds, number of foes, opponent preferences and play styles, the ability to define your race, its ships, styles and techs, and so much more. The game is deep and yet streamlined to really make for easy navigation and hands-off (if you prefer) gameplay through governing, templates and auto-building (using star-base requested constructors etc.)\n\nI am in the middle of a game currently and will expand on this review shortly, after the Drengin succumb to my planetary bombardment of their home world, but alas I was driven to write regarding a particular feature of the game that can be exceedingly off-putting to some players. This feature is as-intended but could (and should be) modified slightly for players who dislike it for reasons noted below.\n\nAs in Gal Civ II, there is a built in surrender feature that the AI will use to effectively give-up and hand over the remnants of its civilization to either the player or a friendly AI (based on diplomacy and relations). This feature can be exciting when it works in your favor, or even when it doesn't. This feature can also add to late-game fun or end a long-slog of conquests planet-by-planet that can end a "won" game. Now, the problem I have with the feature is its inability to be turned off, as it can drastically alter a game you might have been enjoying, for example, a huge build-up, an initial invasion and then sudden, irrational and instant capitulation of every planet in your enemy's empire after the loss of a single border world, or even just a few ships.\n\nThis is entirely my opinion but I see it too often. I see empires, thirty worlds strong, casually give their home world and all their people to another race, and just "quit," based on a relative difference in power to their foe, without even fighting, trying, altering strategy (or ship weapons/defenses), going after strategic resources or using diplomatic means to isolate the foe or recruit allies. This feature is too vaguely defined, and often far too quickly enacted. Would humanity just capitulate outright to an alien species or would we fight, even to a bitter last stand? Now, there are times where it makes sense, but races surrender sometimes to enemies, often ones they are already at war with, to spite the stronger aggressor. This can quickly unbalance games, throw off strategy and realism and steal your fun if you haven't even begun to fight and they are immediately giving up.\n\nThis is a personal nit-pick for me, and I don't want it to discourage people from buying the game, as it's the only thing at all I have had any issues with, the game is polished and otherwise excellent. I only want people to be aware that you can very quickly see your long-time allies causally surrender without losing a planet to their most random neighbor, or a race across the entire galaxy at the opening of a conflict. You might also unfortunately inherit a cash-drained empire, whose ships and worlds sink you into instant debt. You cannot refuse the surrender, you cannot oppose it.\n\nMy one hope is that this feature will be able to be toggled on and off at some point, as I would love to fight my foes to the end, or see the weaker of two forces try other tactics to tip the scales. Change their force consistency to target enemy weaknesses (ex.: exploiting the enemy’s lack of shields, or countering their missiles with point-defenses), maybe target star-base mined resources, recruit allies diplomatically, ask for embargos, petition the United Planets for a peace-keeping force/funds or sanctions or simply fight on until they cannot resist any longer. Too often I get the Thalan empire randomly surrendering their whole populace and territory, despite my having nearly no contact with them, simply because they lost a single world to rampaging Yor forces. I've had Altarians surrender with twenty planets and a huge military (larger than my own in fact), simply because they fought a few turns with the Krynn who were only slightly more powerful.\n\nMy only gripe, my only wish would be to see the surrender mechanic changed to be toggle-able.\n\nBeyond that, throw your money at this game, it's worth it. I have another three or four hundred hours to go before I even consider another game, and with the frequent patches, updates and interesting tweaks, I may find myself dragged in even longer. Please support the game, do purchase it, and do have long late nights of losing sleep to the one-more-turn nature of this amazing game. And thank you, if you've read this far.

It is your typical 4x space game, with somewhat dry lore, with the addition of a racial morality system, complete with perks. The early gameplay is actually quite peaceful and focuses on expansion and diplomacy. It is not until the mid-game is reached that the technology for invading planets with billions of soldiers is unlocked. As with the previous entries, there are a multitude of win conditons: diplomatic, cultural, ascension to a higher plane of being, research, military, etc. The combat is automated and is based on a sort of rock-paper-scissors model, which allows the AI to be a competent oppent. Overall, solid AI provides a decent challenge. If you like creating and building neat spaceships, fear not, for this game features an extensive ship creator, allowing huge freedom in designing the look and loadout of your craft.","June 6, 2015","true","31.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's not there yet.  You might want to read the reviews on the expansion to understand the current state of the game, bellow is my impression some months after release.\n\n[Review from the game's 3rd major update]\nThe game is far from what it should have been. I've backed the game in the alpha stage, but after reading into what they were planning to do, have avoided playing it too much prior to its release as, I didn't wanted to spoil my experience after that point. Now, in perspective, I should have waited even more for the game to be completed... but here we are.\n\nAs with the previous Gal Civ, I've spent most of my time playing this game in the designer mode. In this new iteration, the designer is even better, if you can believe it. If you like Sci-Fi, you'll really like designing your own space faring armada. And with the changes they've made, ships will look more smooth and you'll have more options in terms of angles and shapes. With mods, this can only get better in time. If the developer adds more artefacts, it would really be awesome.\n\nHowever, this great feature isn't, yet, backed up by a balanced and immersive game. There are tons of little misgivings that ruin immersion and I won't go into details to avoid spoilers. Game balance is a big issue though. For me the experience started on the wrong foot, the map didn't spawned the resources required once I've changed the defaults of a new game. Think how it feels finding this out 50h into a savegame. Once you learn how to workaround all these issues and spend several hours to epxand, you'll run into the AI issues. In my case, the AI was passive in many playthroughs. I was the only player on the map with fighting capable ships for 1/3 of the duration of the playthrough in some of my games. I've tried changing my playstyle to see if anything changes. Nope. The AI does an aggressive job at some of the Xs out of the 4x. Exploration and expansion are performed gregariously by the AI, they don't know how to exterminate once they reach another player's borders, human or AI. Also, it's not clear to me how does the AI have the resources to spawn as many ships as it does (it might have been fixed with the latest patches, but it's really hard to playtest this, players don't have enough time for it and it should be counted as a negative for the developers for letting this slip by to begin with).\n\nImprovements from the previous Gal Civ 2, like the hex pattern and adjancency bonuses, are nice and all, but they add too little to the gameplay to compensate. They're great ideas, but it's not enough and considering that the game feels poorly balanced, they don't really compensate for the shortcomings.\n\nOther nitpicks. The UI looks nice, but it's not well thought through. Elements that are required are barely visible, while non-functional elements take most of the screen (in the designer or shipyard for example).\n\nDiplomacy is rather childish and the text options are repetitive. Game length is too high considering what it has to offer. Customisation exists, but you'll be more likely to run into gamedesign limitations and functional issues if you attempt such a thing (for me it's a plus that a developer even attempts such a level of customisation, even if they fail, because it's a dying art in the game industry and I would hate losing it - still, people should know what they get into).\n\nIn conclusion: I will try to complete a game from time to time, but I'll be returning to GC3 because of the designer, unless it improves considerably.","August 5, 2015","false","312.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Beautiful graphics up to 4K resolution and possibly higher.\n\nThe size of the largest maps put to shame every predecessor.  I mean, these things actually resemble small galaxies in scope.  I think the one I'm playing on has over a thousand solar systems, and I'm not quite sure if I picked the largest size available.\n\nYou might infer from the previous information that, despite streamlining and concerted efforts to fight excessive micromanagement that was rampant in the previous game (and, really, any game of this type), playing on the larger maps will still require lots of time per turn, excellent memory, and a sharp eye for enemy actions.  I've probably put.....20 hours or more into my current match, and I would consider it to still be in the early-mid-game stage.\n\nThe ship designer is back, retaining all of its former glory and with even more features.  The funky variable-hardpoint system of the previous game has been reevaluated, so that parts artificially labeled as 'small', 'medium', etc. generally have the same number of spots now, cleaning things up a bit.  The tech tree feels a bit less expansive than before, but still outclasses most competing games.\n\nAnyways, back to playing GC3 - and back to enjoying brilliant explosions, highly detailed planets and planetesimals, and of course some damn good gameplay.\n\nEdit: Oh, I forgot to mention - the AI that shamed Deep Blue is back to put you in your place again, though some others playing have mentioned that it might not be quite as cunning anymore.","April 19","true","55.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atomica/recommended/226860/","atomica","Hoss Porkchops","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atomica/","297 products in account","This is a fantastic take on the 4X genre. As Sid Meier would say, the game is full of interesting decisions. which is a subtlety that a lot of 4X games seem to miss: if a decision isn't interesting, it's just busywork.\n\nPlanetary management is well done and a notch above what you'd find in a typical Civilization-style game. Instead of building all the buildings, you instead place them on a hex grid map of the planet. Even here there are interesting decisions to be made, as the limited room requires both determining what buildings to construction as well as where to build them. In GC3, buildings provide Adjacency Bonuses, and these are important to take into consideration when building out your planet's infrastructure. For example, a Solar power generator provides adjacency bonuses to factories. Do you try to squeeze that solar plant in to create a powerful production world, even though it might mean not having room for another farm or planetary defenses?\n\nWhile many techs are largely shared between the various races, each race also has their own unique techs. For instance the Krynn, a personal favorite of mine, has tech lines and buildings related to Influence and Morale (to those familiar with Civ4/5, think culture and happiness, respectively). Other races like the Drengin are much more military focused in their techs.\n\nUnique techs aren't the only thing separating the races, however. Each race comes with it's own set of statistical bonuses and maluses, but they also have a couple Traits. These traits might provide free colony upgrades on colonization, drone ships to patrol planets and starbases, and various other benefits. One of the races is mechanoid in nature, which means that population must be constructed, not grown. Taken together with the unique techs, each race is left with a distinct feel and looks to provide a lot of replayability. If none of the races appeal to you, the game comes with a custom race editor built into the game where you can set up your own.\n\nThe combat in the game is not fought out in manually controlled tactical battles like Sword of the Stars, instead you watch as your fleet arrays against the opposing forces and engages in battle. This is where you can glean important information in terms of what kind of ships your enemy is fielding. You can get this information while watching the battle unfold, but the game also provides a detailed battle overview at the end so you can see what weaknesses you might have that your opponent is exploiting, or where you can press your advantage. This means that ship design is important, but if you're the type who doesn't want to bother with designing your own units, the game comes with a plethora of built-in ships. Just be aware that the AI can and will make use of any devious designs you create!\n\nSpeaking of AI, I'm only 20+ hours into the game so far so by no means an expert, but the AI thus far has given me a hefty challenge without relying on cheats and resource bonuses (those are available too, but at higher difficulties. If you play against Gifted, the AI fights to the best of it's ability and it's more than a match for me thus far!). This is a welcome relief for me, as shoddy AI has sabotaged many promising strategy games in my catalog.\n\nAn additional avenue of customization is done in game, and that is the Ideology system. Events happen throughout the game such as when colonizing planets as well as random events that will occur. You will be presented with three choices, each related to one of the three Ideologies: Benevolent, Pragmatic, and Malevolent. Selecting a choice related to a particular Ideology will grant you points in that category, which you can use to unlock various bonuses and perks from their respective trees (each Ideology has 4 different bonus lines). You're not locked into one Ideology, but unlocking new perks does get progressively more expensive as you open them up, so choose wisely. Each decision also typically comes with it's own bonuses and penalties, so it's not always an easy decision on which to go with. For example you might be wanting to focus on Pragmatic ideology, but when colonizing a world that you plan to make your research center might have a -20% research penalty associated with it. Do you take the Pragmatic approach despite the penalty, or do you opt for one of the other two? One again, it's an example of frequently making interesting decisions throughout the game.\n\nI'll wrap it up here, but in conclusion I think this game is a no-brainer for fans of the 4X genre. It's smart, elegant, the AI can put up a fight, and I feel the game is well polished for a 1.0 release. The additional of Multiplayer support in GalCiv3 might only be of interest to the minority (one that I am part of), but for those who like to play a game with friends or have a quick match against others online, it's a fantastic feature that is often missing in many strategy games.\n\nGo buy the game!","May 14, 2015","true","78.7"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Constantly saying "just one more turn, one more" finding its 2 or 3 in the morning.\n\nFast forward a few years and I find this game on EA for steam.

Truth be told it still is. I love getting together a nice fleet, build a bunch of ARC 170 fighters from Star Wars (I found it on Steam Workshop) and I simply love massive fights with them!\nHowever this is also pretty much all I like about this game...\n\nWhen I started I had no idea about designing ships and I just built the ones made by default and found myself having a quite weak fleet being massacrated over and over again. Not until I finally started to design my own ships and focus more upon economical and military research (and a lot on reducing size of everything, creating more space in the ships and get the logistics up) did I get any progress at all. I mean I seriously spent about 20 hours stuck in the first mission trying to figure out how I would counter all these continuous attacks coming from all sides! Don't get me wrong though, I got addicted to this challenge, but I feel that the default ships made by the AI should have more balanced in defenses (and not only go for either shield or armor).\n\nAfter I finally won the first mission after 28 hours (I've never spent more than maybe 2-3 hours on the same mission in a game before <_<) I started playing the 2nd mission. This one came down as a real bummer because first of all I couldn't use the ships and planets from my past mission, secondly my designs were all gone and thirdly a large part of the research I had done was reset! This made the game feel unnatural and I felt I had been sent to a paralell universe or was playing a new faction or something. In my opinion a game should always continue where one left off and not ignore the players work and achievements. It just makes all the work and effort seem wasted...\n\nNow despite this I would say that it is somewhat fun, but I think I will stop playing the campaign since I can't stand all my work being reset every time I make some progress in the story...\n\nI overall I would say this game gets a 5,5/10. I don't want to give it a 6 as I am quite divided about recommending it, but at the same time I feel it barely passes the requirements for being recommended, mainly due to the challenge that took me 28 hours to solve.","January 2","true","36.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The game also features a very robust Ship Designer tool, which lets you design your own ships from scratch. The sheer size of the larger maptypes means you can create games that will potentially last you for weeks - Not unlike that of Distant Worlds with up to (and potentially beyond) a hundred or more unique races provided your hardware is up to the task.\n\nCampaign - In a 4X?\nI'm not entirely sold on this concept - While it works in some games better than others, it is definitely more of a lore introduction / tutorial campaign than a full on campaign as you would expect from a series like Heroes: Might and Magic, or Age of Empires. It's short but serves as a great springboard into the meat and potatoes of the game - Sandbox games.\n\nOn a final note - The developers are very active with the community, taking lots of feedback and suggestions from forum posts and livestream comments. These are definitely people who care about the genre and the game - It's not just about the bottom line.","June 6, 2015","true","27.0"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","10","17","0","0"

If you are returning to GC3 from a previous title, then the game will feel very familiar, the systems, mechanics and gameplay are all very much alike to previous versions, this game is about iteration not innovation, building upon an already successful and enjoyable experience from previous titles, with all new graphics and a wonderfully detail ship designer and the always welcome custom race options you will quickly find yourself at home in GC3. For newcomers there is no better time to jump into Galactic Civilizations than now, with fresh new graphics and a user friendly tutorial, it has never been easier to take your first step into this wonderful universe.","July 16, 2015","true","109.6"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

I've been getting to know GC III over the last week or so and I have to say its underwhelming. It is quite playable and good fun, but there have been so many poor choices made with the interface and optimisation that larger games are a trial.\n\nLittle things like having groups of ships appear anywhere as groups in an easily selectable format, rather than every ship being in a single track which doesn't indicate if the ship is part of a particular group or on the other side of the galaxy. The interface for extracting ships from starbases from planets could also be much better. If each fleet or ship had flag that was visible on the map that you could click on to see what it was composed of, that would be awesome. Same with planets and starbases.\n\nThis game is also a system hog, slightly crash prone, and end of turn is also quite slow as every single AL action is played out before the turn will progress.\n\nI will check back in 6 months to see what has changed, but at the moment, its finish and functionality is about comparable to Rome 2 on launch day. Fun and playable, but VERY clunky.","June 4, 2015","false","359.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

(If I get chance to review it, that’s the sort of thing I would say!)\n\n\nElitist Shorthand\n\nIt’s understandable why we do it.\nIt’s easier to use a point of reference than to describe something from scratch, its short hand for those “in the know”.\nThe problem is that if you’re referencing something that is so very old, like for example, an obscure 80’s band that had a song featured in popular vampire movie of the period, the chances are that unless your audience was around in the 80's and remember "The Lost Boys"  movie, then they aren't going to get the reference.\n\n\nInflation\n\nAnother side effect of this historical referencing is that it tends to add value to the “classic” being referred to; it elevates it to a level that the music, game (or whatever) never actually reached.\nThe whole thing feeds on itself and we continue to recycle the classics name for more than it was ever worth.\n\n\nMoo\n\nConsider the 4X space genre.\nIf you mention this particular genre to a PC gamer of a certain age, they won’t be able to resist name dropping “Masters of Orion”.\n\nIt’s definitely a classic 4X title and one which deserved all the praise it received “back in the day” but as the years have passed it seems to have been placed on some sort of pedestal.\nIf you want to bask in its genre defining glory you can only do so wearing rose tinted glasses.\nTo say anything even remotely negative about it is considered gaming blasphemy.\n\n\nOld Moo\n\nThe fact is that it’s now a quarter of a century old, sure, it deserves credit for what it did for the genre back in the early 90’s but there have been many better 4X titles following in its wake.\n\nIf you fired up MOO now and actually tried to play it without wearing your “red shades” then you’re going to be disappointed. It’s long in the tooth, the visuals are archaic and the game mechanics are dated. It’s time to do what princesses Elsa did and "Let it go".\n\n\nMoo’s Wake\n\nSo what of the better 4x titles following in its wake?\nWell, the original Sword of Stars was an amazing game, (the launch of the second one was a disaster but even that came good in the end and at least it tried something a little different).\n\nDistant Worlds Universe is an outstandingly deep space-opera romp, but one which doesn’t get the publicity it deserves (which is probably because it’s expensive and has a “face fit for radio”).\n\nAnother great 4x Space title, and one which might actually get a mention by our “mature” PC gamer when he finally stops delivering his Master of Orion Monologue, is Galactic Civilizations.\n\nAhh... Galactic Civilizations.... now that game takes me back....\n\n\n2003\n\nWhilst Justin Timberlake was asking everyone to cry him a river and Jennifer Lopez really wanted  people to know she was "from the block" Galactic Civilizations was released.\nIt was a hugely enjoyable and pretty much universally well received 4x title\n(unsurprisingly a lot of people compared it Masters of Orion at the time...).\nIt included all the usual tropes of the genre, explore the map, find suitable planets for colonisation, build fleets of ships to defend your territory etc.\nIt was good.\n\n\n2006\n\nBy the time 2006 rolled around, Jenny "from the block" had decided she was an actress and Justin Timberlake was singing about someone with a "sexyback"\nbut " Sexy" wasn't the only thing back in 2006, so was Galactic Civilizations.\nAt the start of that year GalCiv II was released to eager 4x fans\n(who probably compared the sequel to Masters of Orion).\n\nAgain it was well received and had everything we wanted in a sequel, including a shiny new ship design feature!\nLike the original it too "was good".\n\n\n2009\n\nSo the original GalCiv was out in 2003 with a sequel in 2006 and being good at finding patterns where none actually exist I was all set for another instalment of GalCiv in 2009.\nI'd waited patiently for three years, it was time, even the Black Eyed Peas "Had A Feeling".\nThe year slowly unfolded  without news, Lady Gaga pulled a "Poker Face",\nJennifer Lopez decided she was a singer again and Justin Timberlake was trying his hand at acting but sadly there were no GalCiv3 announcements.\n\n\n2013\n\nAnother four years passed by, Jennifer Lopez had discovered a TV show about Idol Americans and had decided that she was a judge and Justin Timberlake, after crying a river because he couldn't see his own sexy-back, was now happily singing about "Mirrors".\n\nBut the big news in 2013 was the announcement from Stardock that, after seven years of waiting they were finally working on a sequel to GalCiv2!\n\n\n2015\n\nFast forward to 2015 and following 2 years in development Galactic Civilizations 3 is finally here, but is it any good?\nWell, to quote a Justin Timberlake inspired and incredibly annoying ad campaign,\n\n"I'm Lovin' It!"\n(I could also really go for a burger right now, I guess advertising really does work.)\n\n\nDressed for Success\n\nSo we know that Galactic Civilizations 3 is a 4x space title, the third instalment in a franchise and like its predecessors, "It is good" but why is it good?\n\nWell, for starters, the alien races you know and love from the previous titles are back, only this time they all look a whole lot better, not in a beauty contest kind of way (The thought of A Drengin in a bikini talking about world peace is as horrifying as it is improbable.), but the HD makeover does an excellent job of making the ugly look uglier...\n\nIn fact everything in GalCiv3 looks lovely, from the aliens and the ships, through to the stars and planets themselves, which you can see  up close and in plenty of detail thanks to the impressive level of camera zoom on offer.\n\n\nFerengi Flavour\n\nThere is a new alien race joining the ranks for this outing too, The Iridium, an ultra capitalist corporation which prioritises economic wellbeing over other concerns.\nYou also have the ability to create your own custom races, along with custom biographies, AI play styles and pictures too!\n\nWant to create a race called "The Lost Boys" with Echo as the leader and the Bunnymen as his overlords?\nThere's nothing stopping you my troubled friend!\n\n\nBigger is Better\n\nI'd suggest that if your planning on ....

Check the forums and all you will see are "thank you's" from the team for bug reports and suggestions; NO excuses or lip service. The Beta ran better then many so called completed games I have purchased. I write this review on the last day of Beta.\n\nExcellent game that rewards and leans towards strategic gameplay; it is lite on combat and a ton of fun for any armchair galactic emperors. An excellent tutorial will get you started and map sizes allow for games that can take anywhere from a few hours to days. Fully customizable gameplay, and ships. I am not too much on the ship thing but changing the gameplay to suit my mood works great here. For anyone who enjoys this type of game it's a "must buy". It is second only to Civ 5 for me in 4X but different enough to be worth owning both.\n\nI have played all three versions of GC and enjoyed each one which has always been better then the last. Stardock has in the past always supported their fans for years after release with upgrades and DLC making any investment in their games a good one.","May 13, 2015","true","188.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I actually pre-ordered this on Stardock before it was on Steam and *totally* forgot about it, which worked out for me I guess since there's like a zillion user-made ships now.\nThe ship design system is better than it was in GC2, and there's LOTS of nice ships on the workshop (personally I love using the Covenant ship hulls from the Halo series for my fleet), but the vanilla ship designs look better as well.\nThe mining system is a general improvement over GC2, taking cues from games like Endless Space that have strategic resources instead of just building a facility on every asteroid to get extra production value on planets. Another point on the mining, the black holes and nebulae/gas clouds/radiation storms are a nice touch to break up the map design.\n\nThe minor races also seem to be improved over GC2, they feel a lot more fleshed-out now rather than just generic civs you beat up and take the lunch money of. I haven't yet tried Revenge of the Snathi, but it certainly looks like some good silly fun.\n\nThe only complaints I can really think of at present are the planets and losing excess research points; I feel like there might have been more variety to palents in GC2, but that could just be nostalgia goggles. Also, as others have said the game will often place your colony capital in stupid or entirely useless locations (like a tile with no adjacent tiles). If you generate more RP in a turn than you need to finish whatever you're researching, the rest just go into oblivion, rather than being saved up. This is a common problem for me since I usually play research-oriented civs, maybe it's less noticible if you play a military/production focused civ like the Drengin.\nEdit: I totally forgot, Espionage didn't return from GC2, which was a little bit disappointing but not a huge deal to me.\n\nBut overall, this game is pretty great and gets an 8/8 from me, mate. That said, you should probably wait until it's on sale, unless you're *really* itching for a 4x game with a good ship designer and fancy graphics.","November 11, 2015","true","72.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

First the larger maps will slow to a crawl when you get further into them, eventually becoming unplayable.  The game itself feels like a downgrade in almost every way to GalCiv 2 and it lacks some of the things that made that game great.  The "difficulty" aspect is non-existent, the devs basically just gave the AI such massive advantages even on normal difficulty that the player is always behind (though still easy to win because the AI is awful.)  Finally it charges five extra dollars for a bunch of things that should've already been in the game.  Those are only the major issues, there are a bunch of minor negative things about this game as well.  Overall it just feels boring, I can't get involved too deeply into it despite spending a ton of time on GalCiv 2 and multiple other space-based 4x.\n\nI recommend no if only because it's not worth $50+$20 dollar for the DLC.","December 11, 2015","false","24.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Stop whining about how the DLC should have been part of the base game. This is how the industry works now.\n\nIn galciv2, half the game happened through DLC, too. You sell the game when it is a viable product, so you can recoup your cost making it. And then you add what the players want and make some more money when selling it as DLC. Games cost too much to "sell them when they are ready". You'll go bankrupt as a studio if you try.\n\ngalciv2 was a great game, and this one is even better. The AI feels less fickle to me this time around.\nBuilding through the tech tree is great fun, and even watching the epic space battles is less boring than I thought. I have yet to use the ship designer, so no idea how awseome it is. But even without it the game is at least a 9/10 for me.\n\nI love how the tech trees have personality for the different races, and how the other races attempt to guilt trip you into giving them free stuff.\n\nBuilding colonies has become even more interesting than with galciv2 because now there are adjacency bonuses, and the star base bonuses are so strong that my current strategy is to build planets for maximized manufacturing and then build a space port and crank out constructors to build star bases around the planet. Only when that is done do I tear down all the manufacturing infrastructure on the planet and switch to research. And I'm still not sure I found the right strategy.

Where it gets caught up, is that there is no general feeling of space. In other words, it's all 2 dimensional. In that sense, we never have a full understanding of where we are in space, relative to other races. This needs to be rendered in 3D. There really is no explanation for why it hasn't been done yet.\nPlanets, ships, stars, all are reduced to an array of dots. Each planet seems no different from any other. You might settle a level 26 planet and it looks the same as a level 12. There needs to be better differentiation between planets.\nLikewise, you may encounter an alien race,  but you're not snapped t0 the action and therefore have no sense from where the alien came from.

However, there are balancing issues, and ai exploits.  One of such is you build a shipyard, and the one with the most manufacturing, the AI will go for, so you just keep switching back and forth between them.  Secondly, this game quits on you from time to time which can be incredibly frustrating, but I've noticed that hasn't happened in quite a while.  Also, with the ship building parts selector, I can't figure out how to turn the model and it seems they took out this feature, which is annoying because I can't see if my ship models look cool all around.  There are many tweaks however to the overall system that are much better in this than Galactic Civ 2 and its expansions, I was however hoping that all of the previous game ship building parts would be included in this one, which they are not.  I like that you can still trade ships in the steam workshop though, and I've made some cool looking ones.  As for the campaign I am disappointed with the minimalist three mission campaign, but I like that your tech stays with you when you move onto the next mission.  However, because of the way the tech tree is it makes it incredibly difficult if you are a non militaristic race against a Militaristic race, because of how slow the tech advances and this needs slight tweaks to make it more fair.  I'm sick of being the Humans and getting absolutely decimated by the stupid Krynn that automatically get huge hulls by the 100th turn.  THe graphics are very good though, and the ship battles are fun to watch, but it would be a bit cooler if it were more like homeworld style battles where you could out manuver your enemies and such.

From the first moment I opened the beautiful, silver box - I was in love. Then at some point I downloaded an amazing Mod that had Star Trek and Star Wars factions, and the game became even more stunning. For the first time since Master of Orion - I found my galactic home.\n\nI was very eager to start playing GalCiv 3. I've tried many space 4x games, and some of them were fun, but THE game that I was waiting for was Galactic Civilizations 3.\n\nWe are less then a month from the release, and this is already a jewel. The devs listened to the community, put lots of work and love into the game, and I believe we have what we were waiting for.\n\nThis game gives us great customization options on so many steps. Creating a custom race lets us work with even color schemes for the starships. And the starships are the greatest strength and customization opportunity GalCiv 3 offers. As you can see in the community creations the possibilities are endless.\n\nI already love the game, but feel that there is a lot more that I can, and should explore. Until now I can absolutely recommend it. As I will play and learn more - I will update my humble review :).\n\nEDIT:\nI created my own factions from Star Trek... Klingons keep attacking me all the time... which is fun... Cardassians also seem keen on waging war... but Earth still prevails, and strengthens the Alliance with the Ferengi.\n\nI love this game! :)","April 23, 2015","true","70.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I never played GalCiv 1, however I logged hundreds of hours in GalCiv2, especially with the mods it accumulated throughout the years. GalCiv3 is very close to being released in May 2015 so I feel it’s at a point it deserves a proper review. I’ve been playing this early access since day 1 and really haven’t started to enjoy it until recently.  Although it was extremely fun to be a part of the development with StarDock within the Twitch Live streams, and the forums, this game really wasn’t fun to play throughout its development cycle until recently.\n\nGalciv3 feels a lot like a GalCiv 2.5 HD version, besides going 64bit (which I praise) it really doesn’t try to do anything new or innovative like its predecessor did for a 4X game. I feel StarDock is really trying to just play it safe with the (if it isn’t broken don’t fix it) approach. There’s still several things that bug me, and these are just the major Issues I have with the game:\n\nFirst off the ship designer is something we’d expect since GalCiv2 had a simple and yet enjoyable designer. However this one is a lot more complicated. I usually start trying to design a familiar ship model from Star Wars or Star Trek and it always ends up being something completely different due to the complexity and limitations of working with 3d models. I really wanted to try to build an X-wing or a star destroyer but get frustrated. That said some might not see this as an issue and makes ships look unique. However after spending about 30mins trying to build a ship that meets my requirements and only having a couple turns in the game, I end up just using the stock ships and play the game never returning to the builder.\n\nThe other thing that disappoints me is the planet view. This really has not changed from GalCiv2, it’s almost a direct clone of its predecessor, besides an animated spinning planet on the edge of the screen which looks nice, but serves no purpose and doesn’t change based on events. The Planet view is flat and the building aspect is just a 2d tile of buildings (think SimCity 1). I voiced my concern on the forums and in the live dev streams about this dated look and really hoped it was just a stand in until it was polished, but it hasn’t really changed since it’s alpha stage. I was really looking forward to a modern equivalent with an Isometric 3d point of view where you can spin the map and see many animations and vehicles and people moving and be dynamic based on the happiness/war/events of the galaxy and you culture, sadly this never evolved from GalCiv2. Also when you click on a planet to research an upgrade which doesn’t require a building it moves the selected tile to the next one leaving it blank, making this experience feel broken and confusing.\n\nThe last negative issue I have encountered is the ship technology upgrade management. Once you build a stock or custom ship and add new technology which you unlocked from researching it and send it out into space, you’ll have a difficult time upgrading it with newer tech especially in mid and end game when you have dozens of ships all over the map. There’s no real easy way to see which ships have the latest technology that you recently unlocked, and it could get very tedious with having a MK 2, 8, 14, 23, 32 version of the same ship with each having just one tech module updated.\n\nI will close with the positives. You can tell the game was designed with passion and love which most games lack these days, the amount of detail from the graphics, cut scenes, gameplay, and features makes this game stand out from the typical cash grabber games like EA produces.  This aspect weighs very heavy on my review more so than any of the negatives I mentioned above.  I’ve yet to really feel full immersion in this game like I did in GalCiv2 but I’m hoping it’s because the game isn’t completed yet.\n\nShould you buy this game? If you played previous GalCiv’s yes I’d recommend it. If you never played either but understand what a 4X strategy game is I recommend it as well. This is a turn based game which somewhat mimics a board game, it’s not real time so some users might be disappointed. You can’t control ships in the battle viewer or the invade screens because it’s simply not that type of game, which is fine.\n\n+polished UI, entire game is made with passion\n+64bit utilizes your PC’s maximum potential giving you very large maps and fleets\n+Graphics and lighting look great and very modern\n+Balance and AI is good not great\n\n-Ship designer can get aggravating\n-Planet view hasn’t been changed since GalCiv2\n-Upgrading ships in space is hard to manage resulting in a lot of versions of the same ship\n\nAs of right now 4/23/2015 I’ll give the game a 7.8/10","April 23, 2015","true","30.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For instance, the ideology system is vary poorly balanced. To have every planet and station within your sphere of influence automatically switch over to your side, is very heavily over-powered. It took me no longer than twenty minutes on my last run through to control almost 100% of the map. And throughout the whole time, I did not so much as even build an additional scout ship (beyond what you start off with of course). Secondly, there are bugs. But this is early access after all. So if you're willing to buy, than you need to take that into consideration. In my case, I have an issue with the diplomacy menu where the music decides to cut out and menu refuses to move. Lastly, the AI still seems to have an edge over the player. For whatever reason the AI colonizes every planet within reach in a rather insane amount of time.

I never played GalCiv 1, however I logged hundreds of hours in GalCiv2, especially with the mods it accumulated throughout the years. GalCiv3 is very close to being released in May 2015 so I feel it’s at a point it deserves a proper review. I’ve been playing this early access since day 1 and really haven’t started to enjoy it until recently.  Although it was extremely fun to be a part of the development with StarDock within the Twitch Live streams, and the forums, this game really wasn’t fun to play throughout its development cycle until recently.\n\nGalciv3 feels a lot like a GalCiv 2.5 HD version, besides going 64bit (which I praise) it really doesn’t try to do anything new or innovative like its predecessor did for a 4X game. I feel StarDock is really trying to just play it safe with the (if it isn’t broken don’t fix it) approach. There’s still several things that bug me, and these are just the major Issues I have with the game:\n\nFirst off the ship designer is something we’d expect since GalCiv2 had a simple and yet enjoyable designer. However this one is a lot more complicated. I usually start trying to design a familiar ship model from Star Wars or Star Trek and it always ends up being something completely different due to the complexity and limitations of working with 3d models. I really wanted to try to build an X-wing or a star destroyer but get frustrated. That said some might not see this as an issue and makes ships look unique. However after spending about 30mins trying to build a ship that meets my requirements and only having a couple turns in the game, I end up just using the stock ships and play the game never returning to the builder.\n\nThe other thing that disappoints me is the planet view. This really has not changed from GalCiv2, it’s almost a direct clone of its predecessor, besides an animated spinning planet on the edge of the screen which looks nice, but serves no purpose and doesn’t change based on events. The Planet view is flat and the building aspect is just a 2d tile of buildings (think SimCity 1). I voiced my concern on the forums and in the live dev streams about this dated look and really hoped it was just a stand in until it was polished, but it hasn’t really changed since it’s alpha stage. I was really looking forward to a modern equivalent with an Isometric 3d point of view where you can spin the map and see many animations and vehicles and people moving and be dynamic based on the happiness/war/events of the galaxy and you culture, sadly this never evolved from GalCiv2. Also when you click on a planet to research an upgrade which doesn’t require a building it moves the selected tile to the next one leaving it blank, making this experience feel broken and confusing.\n\nThe last negative issue I have encountered is the ship technology upgrade management. Once you build a stock or custom ship and add new technology which you unlocked from researching it and send it out into space, you’ll have a difficult time upgrading it with newer tech especially in mid and end game when you have dozens of ships all over the map. There’s no real easy way to see which ships have the latest technology that you recently unlocked, and it could get very tedious with having a MK 2, 8, 14, 23, 32 version of the same ship with each having just one tech module updated.\n\nI will close with the positives. You can tell the game was designed with passion and love which most games lack these days, the amount of detail from the graphics, cut scenes, gameplay, and features makes this game stand out from the typical cash grabber games like EA produces.  This aspect weighs very heavy on my review more so than any of the negatives I mentioned above.  I’ve yet to really feel full immersion in this game like I did in GalCiv2 but I’m hoping it’s because the game isn’t completed yet.\n\nShould you buy this game? If you played previous GalCiv’s yes I’d recommend it. If you never played either but understand what a 4X strategy game is I recommend it as well. This is a turn based game which somewhat mimics a board game, it’s not real time so some users might be disappointed. You can’t control ships in the battle viewer or the invade screens because it’s simply not that type of game, which is fine.\n\n+polished UI, entire game is made with passion\n+64bit utilizes your PC’s maximum potential giving you very large maps and fleets\n+Graphics and lighting look great and very modern\n+Balance and AI is good not great\n\n-Ship designer can get aggravating\n-Planet view hasn’t been changed since GalCiv2\n-Upgrading ships in space is hard to manage resulting in a lot of versions of the same ship\n\nAs of right now 4/23/2015 I’ll give the game a 7.8/10","April 23, 2015","true","30.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

For instance, the ideology system is vary poorly balanced. To have every planet and station within your sphere of influence automatically switch over to your side, is very heavily over-powered. It took me no longer than twenty minutes on my last run through to control almost 100% of the map. And throughout the whole time, I did not so much as even build an additional scout ship (beyond what you start off with of course). Secondly, there are bugs. But this is early access after all. So if you're willing to buy, than you need to take that into consideration. In my case, I have an issue with the diplomacy menu where the music decides to cut out and menu refuses to move. Lastly, the AI still seems to have an edge over the player. For whatever reason the AI colonizes every planet within reach in a rather insane amount of time. No matter how much I would spend on production I could not get my population to expand fast enough to start a reasonable colony.\nNow I should mention the positives. First and foremost, the graphics are remarkable. At full settings the game is beautiful. The video game score is also top notch. Ship customization is also a great tool to tailor the game more to your liking. And with the developers working actively on Galactic Civilzations, it is my hope that the negatives I mention get fixed. Nonetheless, I will still play the series as I am a rather huge Gal Civ fan. So I recommend this game to anyone whose willing to overlook the minor inconveniences, and just have some sort of fun.","April 25, 2015","true","19.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Keep in mind though that GalCiv2 was the same way and given time, GalCiv3 will be a much better experience to an already fun game.\n\nThis 4X game offers many hours of gameplay and replyability with the help of the modding community. The faction/race creator is, by far, the best in the franchise, being able to upload your creation via steam workshop for others to enjoy in their games. Same can be said for the ship designer, I'm personally better at creating races/factions and their backgrounds than designing ships though, but thats what the community is for. Is it worth the price? In the current state, I wouldn't pay full price, BUT and I mean BUT, the developers are continuing on patching and adding features into the game. I have no doubt that it will be a much more in-depth game than GalCiv2 is in its current state down the road, making it well worth it.\n\nThey recently rolled out a free Diplomacy patch and then released the Snathi dlc and percursor worlds dlc for dirt cheap. With that said, whether its now or later, your gonna end up getting the game, so just get it already.\n\n*January 1st, 2016* The game is actually on sale now, so you should go grab it.\n\nPros:\n\nModding community\nIncredible Faction/Race creation\nFirst ever multiplayer in the franchise\nPlenty of options for setting up your galaxy\nGood replayability\nShip Designer vastly improved...and it was already good before.\nDeveloper involvement with community, continuing updates\nJust...one...more....turn syndrome.\n\nCons:\n\nNot much campaign for those who enjoy it (more possible in the future)\nBarebones in comparison to GalCiv2 content-wise (ex: no espionage)\nAI needs some tweaking\n\n\nWith all said and done, yes, I do recommend this game. I played it for a short bit when it came out and just recently gave it another shot. I do see many improvements and the devs making an attempt to expand their product, so I have no problem backing them up. As about the price earlier, get it if its on sale, but would I pay $50 currently in this state? No, maybe $35-$40, but given time with patches, updates, and expansions, it will be worth $50 and possibly more. So if you have it on hand, go for it, but if you can wait, that works too.

I replied, and again, within the day, recieved detailed instructions on how to possibly remedy the situation.\nI followed the instructions, and, unfortunately, the game still crashes. I am changing the review to a positive one, with this description, out of sheer respect for how this game is managed. It's just impressive to see a developer take time out of their schedule to personally help one customer.\nThis review is not positive for the gameplay, which I have not experienced, but for the level of service provided by the dev.\nI won't pretend to have a powerful graphics card, it's just an integrated intel in an acer laptop. I bought this game expecting it to fail, so I could wait for optimization, or to get a better computer.\nIn short, I haven't been able to play the game, but it's the thought that counts, and a lot of that certainly went into my poor little case.

Most 4X games I've played have not had proper story campaigns, so I was happy to see one here. However, there are 2 issues I have with the campaign (other than being very short. Maybe every major race will get one each???).\nFirst off is the tech tree. In the first mission I advanced my kinetic weapons to near maximum however in the second mission I had to do it all again. Same can be said for nearly all techs. Now I'm not sure if they went to base levels again but that was practically the case. Personally I feel there should be some kind of system that carries tech into the next missions, even if it means limiting the max tech level per mission.\nSecondly is the diplomacy. Simply put it is non-existant. Sure you can trade, declare war and ask for peace but thats it. I researched diplomacy to a high level and nothing changed. I could not form an alliance with the Thalians in mission  2, so I had to go to war with them because we were neighbours and my culture was taking them over. They ended up being angry at me and sending threats, then eventually declared war on me. Naturally they did so without fleets at my borders so I just overran them immediately. Maybe AI is an isue too!!!!\n\nOpen End Free Play:\nObviously the diplomacy has a problem here too, but at the moment if you play using the largest 3 galaxies then your game will more than likely crash as all the races get more numerous ships. I was in a game 700+ turns in over about 10 days when all of a sudden when I click on "turn", it froze. To say i was pi**ed was an understatement. It happened twice. The second being just over 400 turns in. But all in all that's my biggest issue with free play.\n\nSo in my opinion if the diplomacy and crashes are fixed this would be a great game. The tech tree is pretty minor since I will only play the campaign once since its not that interesting.","May 18, 2015","true","140.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I like the customization options it gives as far as creating your own ships. This is the 1st time i've played any of the games in the series so I didnt know what to expect. There were a few disappointments such as not being able to control your ships during battle. Instead you can watch your ships do as they please. I guess thats better than just getting a battle report though since it allows you to see where you went wrong & it allows you to see strengths and weaknesses such as if the enemy has mostly missle ships in their fleet you can counter it easier later. It can be very time consuming as well considering it gives you a lot of micro management options for every colony. It can give you advantages & allows you to specialize planets. Creating your own race is pretty cool too. All in all the freedom the game gives you to do as you'd like is great. Its not too good at explaining certain things during gameplay so you may need to do a bit of internet research/you tubing to figure out how some of the features work, but if you like turn based games that allow you to build empires & you're ok with only being able to watch cinematic battles instead of being able to take charge yourself, than I'd recommend giving this game a try.","July 11, 2015","true","647.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Most of these "opinions" ( we can't call them a "review" because the resons these people give is "because i played alot of betas in the past". That may be so but that is something nobaody can verify) saying this; " It is not a beta it's an alfa blah blah blah because i say so". Nobody is talking about gameplay, graphics etc ( no that is not true 99.999999998% isn't talking about graphics, gameplay etc)\n\nI'm not going to educate you how it needs to be so if you are harping on about the alfa or beta BS go somewhere else.\n\nNow about Galactic civ III: graphics looks good even at the lowest setting. The developers did spruce up the interfaces and modernaised them but not soo much that you get the feeling you are playing a completely different game.\n\nGameplay; So far I haven't encountered ANY bugs or lags or things of that nature. The only "bad thing" is that when a planet has been upgraded and fully built up you have to search a bit how you need to continue ( for me that is the fun part.. but if you are really stuck on this you can look it up on goolge or on the forum here in steam).\n\nConclusion: Galactic civ III does have excellent potential and the developers did a good job so far. If the developers ignore the posts about "this isnt a beta this is an alpha because blah blah blah" and focus in on the  people that write about gameplay and what they possibly want to see changed or what they find cumbersome etc the game will be great when it's finished.\n\n\nLet me also thank the developers for this early access. that way we both can have some feedback on the workings of the game. I didn't want a Rome 2 debacle happen again. I did buy Rome 2 because it was so hyped up (and it was a 3 tiered thingy where you got extra games when you pre ordered it). On the release date  there were bugs, crashes and a whole bunch of other problems (even with the activation key) On top of that Rome 2 didn't deliver  what they said, though after 25 gigs of patches and updates it is getting there.","August 22, 2014","true","31.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The 2nd one was very good once the upgrades happened and I think the same thing will happen with this game once those upgrades are places.

The minor races don't have no importance in the game other then giving you a decent planet to conquer once you have expoited them of tech and money.   I don't like the way the enemy will give up even tho it might still have 20+ planets left and give them to a random enemy.  I like to play on the biggest maps possible to make a long fun game.  The maps are big but I was actually hoping for bigger..lol.  I think some of the deplomacy needs some work.   The ship battles are nice but could have done a little tweaking in my option.  Once there face to face the just bounce around each other instead of doing flyby or making it just a little more realistic.  The explosion are awsome and a nice touch.

If you do, then you'll know that I know what I'm talking about when it comes to Stardock games.\n\nGalactic Civilizations III is the successor to the wildly popular Galactic Civilizations II. If you are familiar with Gal Civ II then you should largely know what to expect this time around. There is a multitude of options and settings, performance tweaks and graphical settings. Everything you can think of from Gal Civ II is here and improved upon. Some of the options from the expansions of Gal Civ II are missing, but, if you know Stardock and how they do things then you know those options are coming in future expansions and DLC.\n\nBeing the first installment (base game) there are things that can be improved upon, again though if you know Stardock then you know these things are coming down the road. I wouldn't say they left things out on purpose, but more so because they know they have to have content for future expansions. Have no fear that some of those options you may notice that are missing from Gal Civ II WILL eventually be in Gal Civ III as well. If you'd like proof of this look at the base game (no expansions) of Gal Civ II, then look at Gal Civ II Ultimate Edition and everything that was added in between. This is a pattern with Stardock and they will follow the same pattern here.\n\nThe Gal Civ series has been my favorite Space 4X strategy series since Masters of Orion 1&2. The only thing lacking in Gal Civ in my opinion is directly controllable battles, though you do still have many options when it comes to battles. What roles you design for your ships and how well you design them plays a huge part in battles, and the battles are epic and beautiful. Ground battles and invasions are a bit "bare bones" at the moment, but I can promise you this will be expanded upon with further updates and expansions as well.\n\nModdability in Gal Civ III is Off The Charts!!! This time around basically the entire game is opened up for modding, even more so than Gal Civ II, and you don't need to be a master programmer to do it. New mods and content are being worked on as I type this and the future of Gal Civ III is as bright as the brightest star in the universe. There's nothing here not to like.\n\nIf you've ever been a fan of 4X strategy games or Space strategy games then the only thing you need to be asking yourself right now is "Why haven't I bought this yet?!?!". Don't miss out on this epic gem of a game. If you only buy 1 strategy 4X this year there's no question in what you should be doing right now. Buy it, you won't be disappointed.\n.\n..\n...\n....\n\nWhy are you still reading this? You should be playing right now!!!","May 14, 2015","true","109.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

The camera for the space fights can get some fine tuning but overall they are enjoyable to watch.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCabbage/recommended/226860/","SirCabbage","sir_cabbage_the_green","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirCabbage/","617 products in account","Galactic Civilizations 3 is the latest in a series of space 4X games by Stardock. With this game really what you see is what you get- it really is a highly evolved space based version of civilisation. If you like Civilisation chances are you will love this. That being said there are both positive and negative aspects to this title which sets it apart from its brother. During this review I plan to outline those elements to help you make up your mind on this product. Full Disclosure, I have been a very long term fan of Stardock and their business practises- I backed the game at the $100 “all dlc included” level and in doing so you could say I have a vested interest in seeing this game succeed. That said, I still feel like I should be able to help you make up your mind.\nI have been following Galciv3 since it was first announced and released into early access. One of the first things someone may ask is; how much has changed since this game entered early access? Well the game has seen an entire UI, graphical and gameplay overhaul since the initial alpha stages. Generally the patches came out once ever few months and overhauled the entire game each time. I expect this to be a similar pace to what we will see when development of DLC , Expansions and Patches begins. Stardock is very transparent with their community and often lets users see content long before release during dev streams. To get a good idea of just how much has changed, try watching one of their oldest streams before watching one of their newer ones... it is night and day.\nThings are changing sure, but how is the gameplay? Well, upon starting a new game players’ have the option of customising everything similar to Civilisation. They may tweak the universe to be as hostile or peaceful as they want, crowded or sparse. Players can even design their own civilisation by choosing traits, style and AI personality. Upon starting players are given a scout ship (exploration), a colony ship (settler) and a survey ship (dedicated goodie hut finder). From here the player strives towards one of multiple goals. All the usual suspects are there in the form of Conquest, Time, Research and Diplomacy- but the game also offers alternative victory options such as influence and ascension. The maps can be any size from small 5 min blastoffs to full multi day megamatches. However if you plan on playing on the highest map size (insane) you will really need a beefy PC. Often the slightly smaller sizes of Gigantic, Immese or Excessive are much more “playable”, but they have made recent strives which have allowed me to play Insane til victory comfortably.\nSo just how IS performance anyway? The first thing you need to know about GalCiv3 is that it REQUIRES a 64bit OS to play- if you do not have one you really should be barking up another tree. The game seems to use a large chunk of ram and I can imagine Ram speed being a much higher requirement then in most games. Unlike Civilisation games, GalCiv3 boasts pretty impressive multi-core management. Each AI player runs on a single core/thread until all your cores are doing something. After that deal out starts again. Turn speeds will eventually become an issue, but the release version seems much better than it was even a few days ago.\nThe game is not flawless in its current state. There are bugs and the occasional tooltip error but Stardock says that they plan on supporting GalCiv3 for many years. Currently the plan is to release a series of DLC and Expansion packs slowly over the next few years along with free and sizable patches. How well they actually go with this is yet to be determined but they were generally pretty good with that during the past two GalCiv games. My biggest issue with the game at this time is more the perceived loss of character in the random events. The pictures for these events are not yet as diverse and interesting as they seemed in previous games and I often found myself selecting choices based on stats and ideological desires instead of picking what I would actually do. Another thing which personally irks me is the lack of “Wonders”. Generally there are only a small number of ‘one per galaxy’ buildings which are placed at late places in the tech tree. While in a game of Civilisation the question is “is it worth aiming for this wonder which everyone else could be aiming for”, in Galciv3 it is more like ‘oh, I must be the first person to get this tech. better build the wonder. No need to rush though, likely they have specialised in a different tech tree.’\nIn a first for the series Multiplayer is also included- though it is normally always best to play with someone you actually know as games could last a long time. Unfortunately the “Play by Email” option which was once common for games such as this is not possible. Multiplayer has not tarnished the familiar features though, nor has it taken centre stage. The signature Ship Designer feature is still very much in play, as is a scripted story based campaign. You can still watch your space battles in a pretty impressive (but hands off) way and you still have a (disappointingly simple) invasion screen. There are no Planet Busters currently (eg Terror Star) but they are planned for a later Expansion pack (much like in previous titles). Overall the gameplay is fluid and polished- playing the game feels much better than playing GalCiv2 did.\nOverall I would easily recommend this game, especially if you like the promise of future DLC and Expansion packs. The game is a complete, polished and next generation 4X game which presses all the right buttons for me. Galciv3 is like the Cities Skylines to the CitiesXL or Sim City... A game which is much better optimised at doing what it needs to do, capturing the essence of what people love about the genre without killing your computer. With that in mind I say bravo Stardock- and please bring on the expansions, DLC and Steam Workshop (which will be added in version 1.1).","May 14, 2015","true","168.8"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

I liked the soundtrack, the gameplay, and the look.  The most recent patch has "overhauled" (Read: dumbed down) economic management to the point that the game is just not worth playing at all. Managing the research, production, and wealth of my empire and striking a balance between the three was what I really liked-the war isn't bad or a chore by any means but it's really just not where I found the meat of the gameplay to be. Now that governing my planetary budget is forcibly automated there's nothing to DO. Even the vaunted (and very fun, I might add) player-created starships have gotten hit by this change-now that you can no longer put 100% of a planet's outcome into military production all the player-made ships are too expensive to produce in any kind of reasonable timeframe.\n\nTL;DR:the meat of the gameplay was almost entirely removed in a patch, game is boring now.","October 8, 2015","false","90.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are several things in the games that *should* releive the level of micromanagement, but they don't work how you would like. There is a global production governence that allows you to drive your indistry, but having one item for your entire empire makes things difficult. if you are primarily working on research, newer planets suffer when they could be building up their infrastructure, and provide fulfilling help to the empire, but instead being on the global governence they will contribute a pitence of research and almost never build up their infristructure. prior to 1.4 each planet could have its own governence but this became a nightmare of micromanagement when you had a large number of planets. they created an interesing  "in-between" that allows you to divirert things but in my opinion it is not enough to help balence things where they were before.\n\nThe game has the ability to rely on the provided ai to assist with some of the micomanagement, however the AI is horible. It builds things almost at random, and the ship designs are just as worse.\n\nLast complaint is the space stations. it takes roughly 35 constor modules to fully build up a space station. the AI will only create constructors with only one construcotor modules, but with some work ones with 10+ modules can be created but it requires you to specifically send them roughout the univers instead of using the "oh so conviennt" request constructor button, which only uses the base constuctor. So instead of creating 2 ships for a fully build base it requires the 35.\n\nThese are my biggest complaints. Overall though I enjoy the game as it is nice and relaxing. I just hate the 10 minutes I spend every turn directing my ships and orginizing my planets. If they can fix these things I will change my review but overall I give it an (7/10).","October 31, 2015","false","293.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why?\n(Firstly, not one image in the videos is from actual game footage. Do not be deceived. This game relies on marketing to sell it. If you knew what I knew, you would not buy this game as it is broken in terms of functioning code and game design).\n\nOk, some points about my game experience:\n(you can check every point in the game and they are all factual events. My opinion is not fact but it reflects my observence of these facts in the game)\n\n1 - Crashes every 15-30 minutes on insane mode due to memory leaks. I know it's memory leaks because there are arrays being created but not deleted or reused. Too much data is being accumulated somewhere and it results in the game becoming increasingly slower and slower and finally crashing and instantly going to desktop and closes the game.\n\nYou will have a new appreciation for saving your progress between autosaves when you have long periods of time per turn before the next auto-save. Especially if you just spent 20 minutes cleaning out obsolete units to try and help the game become faster.\n----------\n2 - The space battles look ok at first but after a while you'll notice that it looks like all the spaceships are controlled by drunk drivers who love nothing better than to fly around like a dead goldfish in a whirlpool. This happens as they get closer and the maker seems to have a bad sense of what looks acceptable.\n----------\n3 - Sound often crashes. To overcome this flaw in coding: the music must be turned off and then back on - don't ask me why but it fixes the sound error. Sometimes the game will become unresponsive but not crash and return to windows. When you can no longer interact with anything, just save your current game in a new slot and re-load your game.\n----------\n4 - Computer AI cheats. I have it's bases totally surrounded and it magically creates armies and bases out of nothing in the middle of nowhere. Then the AI will tell me it surrenders and yet I still have to kill it anyway. Don't know if this is a bug or the game designer has a twisted idea of the word 'surrender'. Seriously, cheating is a last ditch effort for programmers who cannot make adaptive AI.\n----------\n5 - the game should be fun but I found it more tedious than my previous job doing data entry of government records OR data entry for Toyota.\nWhy would I say this? There are few shortcuts to do anything in the game. You cannot mass delete, mass rally to a location, or even mass select other than stacking and making a fleet. There are no checkboxes or CTRL+Select to make selective deletion possible.\n\nYou have to do many things individually and honestly this game felt more like a horrible job except that I'm the one paying to do it.... The hotkeys mentioned online do not work in most cases. "Y" works for yes, the working hotkeys are visible in tooltips but the online suggestions mostly do not work.\n----------\n6 - Just when you thought you were moving a slider to look at ships in a list, the tooltip blocks most of the list so you cannot even see what you are looking at.\n----------\n7 - the icons on the minimap are single pixels. Yes, you heard correctly, single pixels!!! Get ready for purple dot units on a purple background for it's team color. THe minimap is so bad I wanted to vomit, eat my vomit, poop it out, eat it again and vomit it again. It will provide hours of frustration as you squint to see wtf you are looking at. Also ship icons in groupings are impossible to recognize because they are just reduced scale images of large pictures. This results in "WTF is that?" moments and you have to then open up another menu to see what is what.\nAnd I'm using a 24" screen 1900x1200 and the minimap is still terrible. Same color for ships on same color for your area of control....so bad....high school art class FTW...\n----------\n8 - The production and rally points are so messy that you'll find half your army hidden in buildings that you never intended them to be in.\n----------\n9 - I make games for a living and so that's partly why I'm so critical. However the game does have it's promising moments but most likely you'll be forcing yourself to play because you paid 40~70 dollars depending on what country you live in. I paid 70 :(\n----------\n10 - The game just isn't fun at all - that's my final opinion after I completed an 'insane size map' that took me 20 hours+ (probably another 2 hours if I include the lost time due to crashes).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nStrategy:\nThe only strategy really is to look at what weapons your enemy's ships have, what armor they have, and then choose the best rock, paper, scissor effect to win fights. The technology you choose should support how you want to play. Influence to steal bases, Friendly to win an alliance win, military to win fights and research to help you get an edge in whatever style you choose. Research alone will not win the game unless you choose that goal.\n----------\nCreativity:\nIf you want to be creative in this game, you'll be very sad. The game has little opportunity for creativity and any startrek / starwars fetishes you have will be crushed when you see the ships floating like dead goldfish in a whirlpool. Yes, you can make spaceships with existing parts however the spaceships update so much and the game is so repetitive AND the battle scenes are so horrible that your art will be spat on by the current game design.\n----------\nReward System:\nThe main rule is that the inefficient player will lose to the AI. So your first few games will be hard but once you have those "ah~~~I see " moments where you realise how to beat the AI, you'll finish it easily but it will just take lots of time.\nLack of patience is punished in this game.\n----------\nUser Interface:\nPatience is also punished because this game makes you a full time data entry person thanks to a useless user interface (UI) which only caters for short games where the structure and unit count is smaller. When you have like 400 of these, the game's UI fails and just shows a blank screen beyond about 200 units in the list. Really helpful when the spaceship you want is at the bottom of the list and the filters don't move it to the top.\n----------\nPrice and Music:\nSorry to be critical but that's the way I am. I paid $70 for the game and I expected a $70 game but this seems more like a fancy prototype / alpha game. I wouldn't call it a beta because it was so buggy I really imagine the programmer to be inexperienced and not an eye for detail or design principles. Art is average but I'm very critical. Oh, and Music is AWFUL...thank goodness for 3rd party music players. Really, really depressing music with no passion in it.\n----------\nClosing Thoughts:\nOnce again, sorry for being so critical but I earned that right when I paid $70 for a game that would have been fair if it was sold for $20~25\n\nNow when I read the following quote:\n\n"You must be running 64-bit Windows 7 or later to play Galactic Civilizations III. This requirement allows us to create the largest, most advanced, strategy game possible."\n\n- I believe this translates into:\n\n"You need 64-bit because my coding is so bad that a 32 bit OS will fail very quickly because I can't clean arrays or debug my game. In other words, I'll break through my lack of coding skill by using your 64 OS to extend the life of my memory leaks."\n----------\nLesson Learned:\nI learned what kind of game design is less effective. This in turn helped me become a better game programmer. I'd avoid this game like the plague until the price comes down. Too late for me, can't be bothered reversing the transaction and having my Steam account limited until they work out why I reversed the bank transaction.","October 21, 2015","false","41.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Why?\n(Firstly, not one image in the videos is from actual game footage. Do not be deceived. This game relies on marketing to sell it. If you knew what I knew, you would not buy this game as it is broken in terms of functioning code and game design).\n\nOk, some points about my game experience:\n(you can check every point in the game and they are all factual events. My opinion is not fact but it reflects my observence of these facts in the game)\n\n1 - Crashes every 15-30 minutes on insane mode due to memory leaks. I know it's memory leaks because there are arrays being created but not deleted or reused. Too much data is being accumulated somewhere and it results in the game becoming increasingly slower and slower and finally crashing and instantly going to desktop and closes the game.\n\nYou will have a new appreciation for saving your progress between autosaves when you have long periods of time per turn before the next auto-save. Especially if you just spent 20 minutes cleaning out obsolete units to try and help the game become faster.\n----------\n2 - The space battles look ok at first but after a while you'll notice that it looks like all the spaceships are controlled by drunk drivers who love nothing better than to fly around like a dead goldfish in a whirlpool. This happens as they get closer and the maker seems to have a bad sense of what looks acceptable.\n----------\n3 - Sound often crashes. To overcome this flaw in coding: the music must be turned off and then back on - don't ask me why but it fixes the sound error. Sometimes the game will become unresponsive but not crash and return to windows. When you can no longer interact with anything, just save your current game in a new slot and re-load your game.\n----------\n4 - Computer AI cheats. I have it's bases totally surrounded and it magically creates armies and bases out of nothing in the middle of nowhere. Then the AI will tell me it surrenders and yet I still have to kill it anyway. Don't know if this is a bug or the game designer has a twisted idea of the word 'surrender'. Seriously, cheating is a last ditch effort for programmers who cannot make adaptive AI.\n----------\n5 - the game should be fun but I found it more tedious than my previous job doing data entry of government records OR data entry for Toyota.\nWhy would I say this? There are few shortcuts to do anything in the game. You cannot mass delete, mass rally to a location, or even mass select other than stacking and making a fleet. There are no checkboxes or CTRL+Select to make selective deletion possible.\n\nYou have to do many things individually and honestly this game felt more like a horrible job except that I'm the one paying to do it.... The hotkeys mentioned online do not work in most cases. "Y" works for yes, the working hotkeys are visible in tooltips but the online suggestions mostly do not work.\n----------\n6 - Just when you thought you were moving a slider to look at ships in a list, the tooltip blocks most of the list so you cannot even see what you are looking at.\n----------\n7 - the icons on the minimap are single pixels. Yes, you heard correctly, single pixels!!! Get ready for purple dot units on a purple background for it's team color. THe minimap is so bad I wanted to vomit, eat my vomit, poop it out, eat it again and vomit it again. It will provide hours of frustration as you squint to see wtf you are looking at. Also ship icons in groupings are impossible to recognize because they are just reduced scale images of large pictures. This results in "WTF is that?" moments and you have to then open up another menu to see what is what.\nAnd I'm using a 24" screen 1900x1200 and the minimap is still terrible. Same color for ships on same color for your area of control....so bad....high school art class FTW...\n----------\n8 - The production and rally points are so messy that you'll find half your army hidden in buildings that you never intended them to be in.\n----------\n9 - I make games for a living and so that's partly why I'm so critical. However the game does have it's promising moments but most likely you'll be forcing yourself to play because you paid 40~70 dollars depending on what country you live in. I paid 70 :(\n----------\n10 - The game just isn't fun at all - that's my final opinion after I completed an 'insane size map' that took me 20 hours+ (probably another 2 hours if I include the lost time due to crashes).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nStrategy:\nThe only strategy really is to look at what weapons your enemy's ships have, what armor they have, and then choose the best rock, paper, scissor effect to win fights. The technology you choose should support how you want to play. Influence to steal bases, Friendly to win an alliance win, military to win fights and research to help you get an edge in whatever style you choose. Research alone will not win the game unless you choose that goal.\n----------\nCreativity:\nIf you want to be creative in this game, you'll be very sad. The game has little opportunity for creativity and any startrek / starwars fetishes you have will be crushed when you see the ships floating like dead goldfish in a whirlpool. Yes, you can make spaceships with existing parts however the spaceships update so much and the game is so repetitive AND the battle scenes are so horrible that your art will be spat on by the current game design.\n----------\nReward System:\nThe main rule is that the inefficient player will lose to the AI. So your first few games will be hard but once you have those "ah~~~I see " moments where you realise how to beat the AI, you'll finish it easily but it will just take lots of time.\nLack of patience is punished in this game.\n----------\nUser Interface:\nPatience is also punished because this game makes you a full time data entry person thanks to a useless user interface (UI) which only caters for short games where the structure and unit count is smaller. When you have like 400 of these, the game's UI fails and just shows a blank screen beyond about 200 units in the list. Really helpful when the spaceship you want is at the bottom of the list and the filters don't move it to the top.\n----------\nPrice and Music:\nSorry to be critical but that's the way I am. I paid $70 for the game and I expected a $70 game but this seems more like a fancy prototype / alpha game. I wouldn't call it a beta because it was so buggy I really imagine the programmer to be inexperienced and not an eye for detail or design principles. Art is average but I'm very critical. Oh, and Music is AWFUL...thank goodness for 3rd party music players. Really, really depressing music with no passion in it.\n----------\nClosing Thoughts:\nOnce again, sorry for being so critical but I earned that right when I paid $70 for a game that would have been fair if it was sold for $20~25\n\nNow when I read the following quote:\n\n"You must be running 64-bit Windows 7 or later to play Galactic Civilizations III. This requirement allows us to create the largest, most advanced, strategy game possible."\n\n- I believe this translates into:\n\n"You need 64-bit because my coding is so bad that a 32 bit OS will fail very quickly because I can't clean arrays or debug my game. In other words, I'll break through my lack of coding skill by using your 64 OS to extend the life of my memory leaks."\n----------\nLesson Learned:\nI learned what kind of game design is less effective. This in turn helped me become a better game programmer. I'd avoid this game like the plague until the price comes down. Too late for me, can't be bothered reversing the transaction and having my Steam account limited until they work out why I reversed the bank transaction.","October 21, 2015","false","41.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have no hesitation in recommending this game to 4x players. The game is really good, no question.\n\nThe devs have made a lot of progress since release; and 1.4 is a big improvement for the ai - for me most notably is that the ai won't spam starbases everywhere anymore.\n\nMy fav things:\n- tech tree is so much better than galciv2\n- nebulae and other stellar background (like black holes)\n- strategic resources\n- ship designer - it is insanely good\n- building on planets is beautiful, smooth and satisfying (especially the adjacency mechanic - making this nicely strategic)\n\nIssues:\n- still buggy in places (but have never had a full on crash). Two bugs for me are that the ai spams messages which are clearly not relevant; and some information doesn't refresh straight away creating some genuine confusion as to what is happening.\n- feature light-ish (this is only a comment in relation to galciv 2, it still has a great many features). I'm sure expansions will correct this and go beyond galciv 2; as it stands in no way is galciv 3 an incomplete game.\n- small payable dlc ... why are these things not in base game kinda thing\n\nSummary:\nGameplay is unquestionably fun, the world is immersive, the sound design is great and the ai is a challenge. This is a good 4x game and I look forward to further patches, development and of course the three planned expansions.\n\nGo buy.\n\nEDIT: forgot to say how awesome the multiplayer is, smooth and crisp. The game is also 64 bit which is a massive step up from galciv 2 creating what I can only describe as a brilliant play experience with no lag experienced yet.","October 30, 2015","true","145.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The computer opponents don't simply try to defeat you and each other; they can be assigned general personalities. The many paths to victory also allows the player much flexibility in style.\n\nAlso, I give credit to Stardock for always abiding by strong standards and providing beautiful finished products.

Secondly an enemy can win, which just happened to me, and I have no idea how. It's also possible to buy ships from an ally in exchange for technology, then use their own ships to invade them. :) You can also bankrupt an enemy, as I did, by buying loads of ships from allies then gift them to an enemy, the upkeep then destroys their econimy XD.\n\nPersonally I focus on food, growth and science, I also focus on one thing at a time normally... the mechanics are more or less fine, it's really just the interface which I dislike because like I said finding things like my ships, planets and star bases can be tricky.","September 8, 2015","true","58.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Starrbases are horribly underpowered and weak with pitiful range. You can play games with the AI to keep them from destroying certain assest where a Human player would just ignore. There needs to be tactics settings when your ships goto battle, at least some interaction rather than just watching random outcomes. The tech tree is confusing at 1st, there needs to be a little more explination on the benifits and detriments to a particular choice, otherwise you have to figure it out by trial and error and the games can be long and you find out you made a poor choice 5 plus hours into a game. You cant have mutilpe parties picking the same race on a multiplayer skirmish, why ? You can't change you ship color or Icon or Profile picture.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Demonweed/recommended/226860/","Demonweed","Demonweed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Demonweed/","141 products in account","I've been playing Galactic Civilizations from the start of the series.  Fans of the earlier titles are likely to enjoy this iteration.  Most of the core ideas are well-implemented, and the look of the game is appropriately updated.  Particular highlights include a more diverse body of random events (even before obtaining the Mega Events DLC), an ideological system, race-specific tech trees, and an incredibly nuanced ship designer.  Of course, there is robust support for custom-designed content, which should proliferate as the playerbase grows.\n\nFor people unfamiliar with the series, Galactic Civilizations is about competitive empire-building.  In the standard game, a player begins with a spacefaring race still limited to its homeworld.  Simultaneously managing exploration, settlement, economic development, technological growth, and security concerns; the aim is to colonize distant worlds and thrive.  Victory conditions often include peaceful options like diplomacy or even transcending physical existence itself, though violent conquest is also on the list.  Managing large happy colonies provides the resources to attempt the loftiest goals.\n\nHaving played many games in this 4X genre, I feel Galactic Civilizations III strikes a nice balance between accessibility and complexity.  It is possible to control every detail right down to the placement of decorative fins on warships, but delegating to the AI to focus on high-level questions and strategic command is also a viable approach.  I don't yet have enough experience to have a strong opinion about the AI, but I find the normal difficulty setting suitable for learning the ropes.  Ideology is a particular treat, giving significant consequence to the morality of crucial choices.  For players willing to put in the time a serious strategy game demands, Galactic Civilizations III should provide many hours of pleasant satisfaction.","October 3, 2015","true","122.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having played MOO1, MOO2, Gal Civs 1,2 and now number 3, this is by far the most engaging and challenging game yet.\n________________________________________________________________\nPros:\nVery nice graphics all around.  Planets now show city lights on the dark side and the background is just beautiful.  Ships also really pop out.  Huge fleet battles looks really good!\nThe Ship Designer is top notch as always.  Plenty of options to make almost anything you can imagin.\nA lot of nice fixes to diplomacy. Every race no longer DoW for no reason... except the Drengin but that's    expected.\nThe absolute huge size of the galaxy makes for some epic empire vs empire wars.  I only play on Insane size!\nCivilization customization is well done and there are so many options to make the civilization of your dreams.\nSteam Workshop support.  Makes up for the lack of starting civs by using the faction mods and can add some awesome looking ships to your game.  Lots of great work done by the community.\nContinuing the story/campiegn from previous Gal Civs.  (That opening cutscene is just AWESOME!)\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nCons:\n\n(As of this review) No planetary invasion cutscenes or otherwise some neat way of seeing your troops conquer the planet.  It all happens in the background instantly and is very anti-climatic.  This is something that was in previous Gal Civs but not in this one and it is a little bit of a let down.  I hold out hope that Stardock will add it in either by patch or DLC.\n\nNeeds some better management/organization options for fleets.  Whenever you add a ship to a fleet it changes the fleets name to some random number with your factions name.  For me the naming of fleets is important so I can at a glance of the list tell where certain fleets are without cycling though all of them. This can get annoying when upgrading ships you will need to change the fleet name each time you add the ship back into fleet.  When I have 50+ Fleets of various sizes and purposes running around, trying to remember which ones I named what can get frustrating.\n\nThough civilizations will not DoW as much I still have the unbelieveable occurence of some civs (Drengin mostly) DoW even if they are not even remotly in range of my empire to fight/invade.  So it is a war in name only.  The AI bu now should be able to take into account the distance of it's empire to the one it wants to DoW.  When you make another Civ know you want to destroy them they tend to prepare for you and this kind of removes the possablility of being attacked by suprise (ex: Peral Harbor style)\n\nAI Behavior in general:  The AI can behave in some strange ways and seems to lack proper skills to manage their own planets.  I tend to find their planets near rebellion or under developed.  I then find it strange to see with such poor managment how they can afford fleets of such epic size.  In fact I would say AI behavior is the biggest flaw in this game.\n_________________________________________________________\n\nConclusion:  Depsite the cons, which are in my opinion really kinda minor when it comes to the rest of this game,  Galactic Civilizations III is one of the very top 4x strategy games on the market at this very moment.  Very engaging and beautiful, I tip my hat to you Stardock... well done.  I look forward to see what else you bring to this game and series.","October 3, 2015","true","96.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did find some of the extreme times on research a bit tedious and I did find the income remains a bit too slow to develop.  I don't want to spend forever on the larger galaxies and that IS what it ends up feeling like when you make the research trees and income take that long while making the game start out at ridiculous sublight technology levels.  Too slow to develop and way too economically pinched to remain fun for any but the most devoted.  If you choose to cater to the extremists in this regard you will lose too many of the casuals.  I love this genre and I loved so much about this game other than the slow research trees and restrictively slow economic growth.  That being said my son, brother and best friend all played it once and I think the reiterated quote was "It's no Masters of Orion"  although they did admit to my defense of the wonderful new ideas, expansive ship design and beautiful graphics.

I liked the soundtrack, the gameplay, and the look.  The most recent patch has "overhauled" (Read: dumbed down) economic management to the point that the game is just not worth playing at all. Managing the research, production, and wealth of my empire and striking a balance between the three was what I really liked-the war isn't bad or a chore by any means but it's really just not where I found the meat of the gameplay to be. Now that governing my planetary budget is forcibly automated there's nothing to DO. Even the vaunted (and very fun, I might add) player-created starships have gotten hit by this change-now that you can no longer put 100% of a planet's outcome into military production all the player-made ships are too expensive to produce in any kind of reasonable timeframe.\n\nTL;DR:the meat of the gameplay was almost entirely removed in a patch, game is boring now.","October 8, 2015","false","90.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are several things in the games that *should* releive the level of micromanagement, but they don't work how you would like. There is a global production governence that allows you to drive your indistry, but having one item for your entire empire makes things difficult. if you are primarily working on research, newer planets suffer when they could be building up their infrastructure, and provide fulfilling help to the empire, but instead being on the global governence they will contribute a pitence of research and almost never build up their infristructure. prior to 1.4 each planet could have its own governence but this became a nightmare of micromanagement when you had a large number of planets. they created an interesing  "in-between" that allows you to divirert things but in my opinion it is not enough to help balence things where they were before.\n\nThe game has the ability to rely on the provided ai to assist with some of the micomanagement, however the AI is horible. It builds things almost at random, and the ship designs are just as worse.\n\nLast complaint is the space stations. it takes roughly 35 constor modules to fully build up a space station. the AI will only create constructors with only one construcotor modules, but with some work ones with 10+ modules can be created but it requires you to specifically send them roughout the univers instead of using the "oh so conviennt" request constructor button, which only uses the base constuctor. So instead of creating 2 ships for a fully build base it requires the 35.\n\nThese are my biggest complaints. Overall though I enjoy the game as it is nice and relaxing. I just hate the 10 minutes I spend every turn directing my ships and orginizing my planets. If they can fix these things I will change my review but overall I give it an (7/10).","October 31, 2015","false","293.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The only issues we have had is that sometimes when trying to join the game together the game locks up or has difficulties. Also we would both like to see the bigger universe sizes in multiplayer, I think this might be in beta.  More races would be fun, but then again we have also had a great time creating our own races. The only other thing that seems odd is that star base structures do not seem to be effected by influence. I have already recommened this game to  several friends.

Having played MOO1, MOO2, Gal Civs 1,2 and now number 3, this is by far the most engaging and challenging game yet.\n________________________________________________________________\nPros:\nVery nice graphics all around.  Planets now show city lights on the dark side and the background is just beautiful.  Ships also really pop out.  Huge fleet battles looks really good!\nThe Ship Designer is top notch as always.  Plenty of options to make almost anything you can imagin.\nA lot of nice fixes to diplomacy. Every race no longer DoW for no reason... except the Drengin but that's    expected.\nThe absolute huge size of the galaxy makes for some epic empire vs empire wars.  I only play on Insane size!\nCivilization customization is well done and there are so many options to make the civilization of your dreams.\nSteam Workshop support.  Makes up for the lack of starting civs by using the faction mods and can add some awesome looking ships to your game.  Lots of great work done by the community.\nContinuing the story/campiegn from previous Gal Civs.  (That opening cutscene is just AWESOME!)\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nCons:\n\n(As of this review) No planetary invasion cutscenes or otherwise some neat way of seeing your troops conquer the planet.  It all happens in the background instantly and is very anti-climatic.  This is something that was in previous Gal Civs but not in this one and it is a little bit of a let down.  I hold out hope that Stardock will add it in either by patch or DLC.\n\nNeeds some better management/organization options for fleets.  Whenever you add a ship to a fleet it changes the fleets name to some random number with your factions name.  For me the naming of fleets is important so I can at a glance of the list tell where certain fleets are without cycling though all of them. This can get annoying when upgrading ships you will need to change the fleet name each time you add the ship back into fleet.  When I have 50+ Fleets of various sizes and purposes running around, trying to remember which ones I named what can get frustrating.\n\nThough civilizations will not DoW as much I still have the unbelieveable occurence of some civs (Drengin mostly) DoW even if they are not even remotly in range of my empire to fight/invade.  So it is a war in name only.  The AI bu now should be able to take into account the distance of it's empire to the one it wants to DoW.  When you make another Civ know you want to destroy them they tend to prepare for you and this kind of removes the possablility of being attacked by suprise (ex: Peral Harbor style)\n\nAI Behavior in general:  The AI can behave in some strange ways and seems to lack proper skills to manage their own planets.  I tend to find their planets near rebellion or under developed.  I then find it strange to see with such poor managment how they can afford fleets of such epic size.  In fact I would say AI behavior is the biggest flaw in this game.\n_________________________________________________________\n\nConclusion:  Depsite the cons, which are in my opinion really kinda minor when it comes to the rest of this game,  Galactic Civilizations III is one of the very top 4x strategy games on the market at this very moment.  Very engaging and beautiful, I tip my hat to you Stardock... well done.  I look forward to see what else you bring to this game and series.","October 3, 2015","true","96.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Demonweed/recommended/226860/","Demonweed","Demonweed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Demonweed/","141 products in account","I've been playing Galactic Civilizations from the start of the series.  Fans of the earlier titles are likely to enjoy this iteration.  Most of the core ideas are well-implemented, and the look of the game is appropriately updated.  Particular highlights include a more diverse body of random events (even before obtaining the Mega Events DLC), an ideological system, race-specific tech trees, and an incredibly nuanced ship designer.  Of course, there is robust support for custom-designed content, which should proliferate as the playerbase grows.\n\nFor people unfamiliar with the series, Galactic Civilizations is about competitive empire-building.  In the standard game, a player begins with a spacefaring race still limited to its homeworld.  Simultaneously managing exploration, settlement, economic development, technological growth, and security concerns; the aim is to colonize distant worlds and thrive.  Victory conditions often include peaceful options like diplomacy or even transcending physical existence itself, though violent conquest is also on the list.  Managing large happy colonies provides the resources to attempt the loftiest goals.\n\nHaving played many games in this 4X genre, I feel Galactic Civilizations III strikes a nice balance between accessibility and complexity.  It is possible to control every detail right down to the placement of decorative fins on warships, but delegating to the AI to focus on high-level questions and strategic command is also a viable approach.  I don't yet have enough experience to have a strong opinion about the AI, but I find the normal difficulty setting suitable for learning the ropes.  Ideology is a particular treat, giving significant consequence to the morality of crucial choices.  For players willing to put in the time a serious strategy game demands, Galactic Civilizations III should provide many hours of pleasant satisfaction.","October 3, 2015","true","122.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why?\n(Firstly, not one image in the videos is from actual game footage. Do not be deceived. This game relies on marketing to sell it. If you knew what I knew, you would not buy this game as it is broken in terms of functioning code and game design).\n\nOk, some points about my game experience:\n(you can check every point in the game and they are all factual events. My opinion is not fact but it reflects my observence of these facts in the game)\n\n1 - Crashes every 15-30 minutes on insane mode due to memory leaks. I know it's memory leaks because there are arrays being created but not deleted or reused. Too much data is being accumulated somewhere and it results in the game becoming increasingly slower and slower and finally crashing and instantly going to desktop and closes the game.\n\nYou will have a new appreciation for saving your progress between autosaves when you have long periods of time per turn before the next auto-save. Especially if you just spent 20 minutes cleaning out obsolete units to try and help the game become faster.\n----------\n2 - The space battles look ok at first but after a while you'll notice that it looks like all the spaceships are controlled by drunk drivers who love nothing better than to fly around like a dead goldfish in a whirlpool. This happens as they get closer and the maker seems to have a bad sense of what looks acceptable.\n----------\n3 - Sound often crashes. To overcome this flaw in coding: the music must be turned off and then back on - don't ask me why but it fixes the sound error. Sometimes the game will become unresponsive but not crash and return to windows. When you can no longer interact with anything, just save your current game in a new slot and re-load your game.\n----------\n4 - Computer AI cheats. I have it's bases totally surrounded and it magically creates armies and bases out of nothing in the middle of nowhere. Then the AI will tell me it surrenders and yet I still have to kill it anyway. Don't know if this is a bug or the game designer has a twisted idea of the word 'surrender'. Seriously, cheating is a last ditch effort for programmers who cannot make adaptive AI.\n----------\n5 - the game should be fun but I found it more tedious than my previous job doing data entry of government records OR data entry for Toyota.\nWhy would I say this? There are few shortcuts to do anything in the game. You cannot mass delete, mass rally to a location, or even mass select other than stacking and making a fleet. There are no checkboxes or CTRL+Select to make selective deletion possible.\n\nYou have to do many things individually and honestly this game felt more like a horrible job except that I'm the one paying to do it.... The hotkeys mentioned online do not work in most cases. "Y" works for yes, the working hotkeys are visible in tooltips but the online suggestions mostly do not work.\n----------\n6 - Just when you thought you were moving a slider to look at ships in a list, the tooltip blocks most of the list so you cannot even see what you are looking at.\n----------\n7 - the icons on the minimap are single pixels. Yes, you heard correctly, single pixels!!! Get ready for purple dot units on a purple background for it's team color. THe minimap is so bad I wanted to vomit, eat my vomit, poop it out, eat it again and vomit it again. It will provide hours of frustration as you squint to see wtf you are looking at. Also ship icons in groupings are impossible to recognize because they are just reduced scale images of large pictures. This results in "WTF is that?" moments and you have to then open up another menu to see what is what.\nAnd I'm using a 24" screen 1900x1200 and the minimap is still terrible. Same color for ships on same color for your area of control....so bad....high school art class FTW...\n----------\n8 - The production and rally points are so messy that you'll find half your army hidden in buildings that you never intended them to be in.\n----------\n9 - I make games for a living and so that's partly why I'm so critical. However the game does have it's promising moments but most likely you'll be forcing yourself to play because you paid 40~70 dollars depending on what country you live in. I paid 70 :(\n----------\n10 - The game just isn't fun at all - that's my final opinion after I completed an 'insane size map' that took me 20 hours+ (probably another 2 hours if I include the lost time due to crashes).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nStrategy:\nThe only strategy really is to look at what weapons your enemy's ships have, what armor they have, and then choose the best rock, paper, scissor effect to win fights. The technology you choose should support how you want to play. Influence to steal bases, Friendly to win an alliance win, military to win fights and research to help you get an edge in whatever style you choose. Research alone will not win the game unless you choose that goal.\n----------\nCreativity:\nIf you want to be creative in this game, you'll be very sad. The game has little opportunity for creativity and any startrek / starwars fetishes you have will be crushed when you see the ships floating like dead goldfish in a whirlpool. Yes, you can make spaceships with existing parts however the spaceships update so much and the game is so repetitive AND the battle scenes are so horrible that your art will be spat on by the current game design.\n----------\nReward System:\nThe main rule is that the inefficient player will lose to the AI. So your first few games will be hard but once you have those "ah~~~I see " moments where you realise how to beat the AI, you'll finish it easily but it will just take lots of time.\nLack of patience is punished in this game.\n----------\nUser Interface:\nPatience is also punished because this game makes you a full time data entry person thanks to a useless user interface (UI) which only caters for short games where the structure and unit count is smaller. When you have like 400 of these, the game's UI fails and just shows a blank screen beyond about 200 units in the list. Really helpful when the spaceship you want is at the bottom of the list and the filters don't move it to the top.\n----------\nPrice and Music:\nSorry to be critical but that's the way I am. I paid $70 for the game and I expected a $70 game but this seems more like a fancy prototype / alpha game. I wouldn't call it a beta because it was so buggy I really imagine the programmer to be inexperienced and not an eye for detail or design principles. Art is average but I'm very critical. Oh, and Music is AWFUL...thank goodness for 3rd party music players. Really, really depressing music with no passion in it.\n----------\nClosing Thoughts:\nOnce again, sorry for being so critical but I earned that right when I paid $70 for a game that would have been fair if it was sold for $20~25\n\nNow when I read the following quote:\n\n"You must be running 64-bit Windows 7 or later to play Galactic Civilizations III. This requirement allows us to create the largest, most advanced, strategy game possible."\n\n- I believe this translates into:\n\n"You need 64-bit because my coding is so bad that a 32 bit OS will fail very quickly because I can't clean arrays or debug my game. In other words, I'll break through my lack of coding skill by using your 64 OS to extend the life of my memory leaks."\n----------\nLesson Learned:\nI learned what kind of game design is less effective. This in turn helped me become a better game programmer. I'd avoid this game like the plague until the price comes down. Too late for me, can't be bothered reversing the transaction and having my Steam account limited until they work out why I reversed the bank transaction.","October 21, 2015","false","41.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Planetary invasion is over simple and it's hard not to succeed in a ground invasion. Various aliens are not really very unique. Planetary defenses aren't worth putting effort into as invasions suceed anyway. Orbital spacecraft are a race attribute "Paranoid" rather than technology and deliberately building planetary defenses. You can learn to put fighters on carriers but for some reason this doesn't translate into planet based fighters. Still very fun. But it could be great with a little effort.

The ship design is cool and I've used ships from Halo and Mass Effect in games I've played, I'm using Stargate next. There are issues though, build times for ships can get ridiculous to the point it takes almost 100 turns to complete 1 ship. The more you research new weapons and such the more adanced your ships become, but also the longer they take to build.  Even with a ton of manufacturing buildings on my colony and a support station aiding in construction the build times were still ridiculous.\n\nThe diplomacy seems better than civilization but the characters have no life to them, they have no voice acting and they all use the same movements. Trading technologies can be a good way to stay ahead but if you want a ship from them you need to basically give up your empire for 1 ship. Even then it can be destroyed easily because the A.I. has no issues with construction. they can turn out fleets like they're nothing at all.\n\nThere are some game breaking bugs still, one I ran into in the campaign. I defeated the enemy and tried taking the homeworld back, but a bug prevented the game from recodnizing the ship was where it should be to win so i never did in that playthrough.\n\ndespite all of that though the game is fun, just way too long it certain areas such as ship building and has some bugs. I play this like i did Civilization 5 when it came out, all the time. Get the game and play with friends with your own designed ships, I like using the Alliance ships from Mass Effect against my buddy playing with his Star Wars ships. Its a lot of fun as long as some bugs dont bother you.\n","August 28, 2015","true","88.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The AI, apparently, also knows where all the inhabitable planets are from the start since they will come and colonize them before sending scouts, even in my backyard.  While annoying, its not game breaking, but the passive AI does hinder it quite a bit.  It gives you a ton of time to slowly build up and grow before you declare war on another, and by that time, you will win most likely.","August 28, 2015","true","199.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved the customization for the game you could practilly spend hours withot even playing the game and still have a ton of fun. make what you want. I created my own rce in the game and it's awsome. and the ship designer along with factions and the workshop incorporated in the game. that can bring some more replayablility due to custom faction and make thing like x wings from star wars, or the enterprise from star trek.\n\n2. the gameplay is solid. you have 8 races to play with their own uniqe traits and this can effect how you play and adds more time to replay value for the game. if your a fan of space/si-fi game this will be your dream game. running you very own empire the way you want and conquer the galaxy. A side note, I'd like to thank Angry Joe for streaming this game months ago, if it wasnt for that i would not be playing this game. the game is rich in content and feel just like an RPG, but in SPACE!\n\nNow what are some thing that disappointed me or didn't like\n\n1. No local Multiplayer but it does have online multiplayer so there that\n2. There were some issues (for me at least) that the game crashed somtime while loading the designer screen where you design ship i had that happen about 2 times so it does crash and have bugs\n3. the A.I. is a bit of a pushover if your playing on lower difficultys. and with that (and i can't comfirm that this happens on higher difficultys above normal) it lead to exploiting some things with the A.I. like wearing down opposing fleets that im at war with useing shipyards. So i would recommand you play on higher difficultys that is above normal. though it doesn't work all the tim but it can happen with smaller fleet sizes and having a tone of preduction to produce shipyards about every turn at will.\n4. the cainpain was surpisingly short there are three campain maps though it does make up for it in time with objectives and bigger maps. at least it's not 4 hours. at least i think it is.\n\nNow i would recommand this game but only if you like sitting at your compter for hours and have a beast machine and play for hours. if you have a low end pc it might not be the greatest thing to buy but once you get a better pc then get this game.\n\n\n","September 6, 2015","true","390.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its great fun and you always want to do just one more turn. The ship designer is very good and you can create just about any ship you have seen in sci-fi movies as well as design your own look. You can create and design your own race and decide what bonuses or penalties your race should have from a number of options.\n\nThere are a few things that annoy me though. Diplomacy could use a bit more work. The AI has no respect for your borders. You can't destroy their ships inside your borders without declaring war. You can't warn the AI to stay out of your borders or demand that the AI remove a star base inside your borders the AI can however request that you remove yours inside their borders.\n\nWhile I really like the control you have and how much you can micro manage your empire this becomes a chore when you have say 25 or more planets. I would like to be able to make a template for the planets window where I set core buildings for an industrial planet, core buildings for a science planet, core buildings for economy planets and core buildings for a bread basket.","August 18, 2015","true","268.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I did find some of the extreme times on research a bit tedious and I did find the income remains a bit too slow to develop.  I don't want to spend forever on the larger galaxies and that IS what it ends up feeling like when you make the research trees and income take that long while making the game start out at ridiculous sublight technology levels.  Too slow to develop and way too economically pinched to remain fun for any but the most devoted.  If you choose to cater to the extremists in this regard you will lose too many of the casuals.  I love this genre and I loved so much about this game other than the slow research trees and restrictively slow economic growth.  That being said my son, brother and best friend all played it once and I think the reiterated quote was "It's no Masters of Orion"  although they did admit to my defense of the wonderful new ideas, expansive ship design and beautiful graphics.

As of late summer 2015, the game has a few rough edges which could use polishing (sub-optimal path plotting while moving units and stale UI panel components are probably the biggest 2 for me right now). However, Stardock has released updates recently addressing other flaws, indicating this not EA style abandonmed-ware.\n\nMost importantly:  the fundamentals foundation of GC3 appears stout. At the risk of sounding like a fan-boy, my assessment is this is currently the premier turn based strategy game on the market. This game supports the requisite feature set and strategic warfare dynamics I expect out from this genre, which the forefunner competitor's latest generation of titles should have but do not.\n\nKudos to Stardock for finding a working formula, sticking with it, and judiciously knowing how far to go with incremental evolution.","August 15, 2015","true","461.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I know i was expecting different campaigns for the different races or at least the major ones so to only have three campaigns for this game is a complete joke and then they will probably try to charge for them which makes it even less worth it.  There are however some pro's to this came, the ships, technology tree's, different races, planet control are all Pro's, however the major con far outweighs the pro.  Stardock if you are going to make a game then you make it in its entirety and not relase it until its ready whcih means actual campaigns.  Additionally, one of the campaigns cannot be completed at this time if you choose a certain ideology path of getting another hidden planet because it tends to spawn on a game point you need to bring down the Precursor and the dev's comment was this was unforeseen and will be fixed later.

On large maps the game rapidly becomes clunky and very time consuming. Micro-management of every little issue can bog turns down a bit if you are a bit of a perfectionist.\n\nI play games to have fun however. So I just build whatever I need to keep my empire going and tweak it as I go along. That means I don't get bogged down. I would probably be thrashed in a multiplayer by an optimiser. However my turns take 5 minutes as opposed to their half hour turns and I am having more fun. ^_^\n\nA nice big, heavily detailed turn based sci-fi strategy game with excellent race customisation, good ship construction, nicely sized tech trees and the possibility for galaxy maps that feel like they are an actual galaxy. The game does not lag too badly even on the largest maps. The automated battles run pretty well and look fantastic!\n\nI like this game quite a bit and would recommend it. The $50 price tag is a little too high and yes, it crashes sometimes (in particular when generating a new map it will sometime CTD). The UI does take a lot of clicking back and forward when fiddling with production and taxation settings.\nHowever if you are patient it is worth it. :)\n\nCheck it out. :D","October 1, 2015","true","61.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having played MOO1, MOO2, Gal Civs 1,2 and now number 3, this is by far the most engaging and challenging game yet.\n________________________________________________________________\nPros:\nVery nice graphics all around.  Planets now show city lights on the dark side and the background is just beautiful.  Ships also really pop out.  Huge fleet battles looks really good!\nThe Ship Designer is top notch as always.  Plenty of options to make almost anything you can imagin.\nA lot of nice fixes to diplomacy. Every race no longer DoW for no reason... except the Drengin but that's    expected.\nThe absolute huge size of the galaxy makes for some epic empire vs empire wars.  I only play on Insane size!\nCivilization customization is well done and there are so many options to make the civilization of your dreams.\nSteam Workshop support.  Makes up for the lack of starting civs by using the faction mods and can add some awesome looking ships to your game.  Lots of great work done by the community.\nContinuing the story/campiegn from previous Gal Civs.  (That opening cutscene is just AWESOME!)\n\n____________________________________________________________\n\nCons:\n\n(As of this review) No planetary invasion cutscenes or otherwise some neat way of seeing your troops conquer the planet.  It all happens in the background instantly and is very anti-climatic.  This is something that was in previous Gal Civs but not in this one and it is a little bit of a let down.  I hold out hope that Stardock will add it in either by patch or DLC.\n\nNeeds some better management/organization options for fleets.  Whenever you add a ship to a fleet it changes the fleets name to some random number with your factions name.  For me the naming of fleets is important so I can at a glance of the list tell where certain fleets are without cycling though all of them. This can get annoying when upgrading ships you will need to change the fleet name each time you add the ship back into fleet.  When I have 50+ Fleets of various sizes and purposes running around, trying to remember which ones I named what can get frustrating.\n\nThough civilizations will not DoW as much I still have the unbelieveable occurence of some civs (Drengin mostly) DoW even if they are not even remotly in range of my empire to fight/invade.  So it is a war in name only.  The AI bu now should be able to take into account the distance of it's empire to the one it wants to DoW.  When you make another Civ know you want to destroy them they tend to prepare for you and this kind of removes the possablility of being attacked by suprise (ex: Peral Harbor style)\n\nAI Behavior in general:  The AI can behave in some strange ways and seems to lack proper skills to manage their own planets.  I tend to find their planets near rebellion or under developed.  I then find it strange to see with such poor managment how they can afford fleets of such epic size.  In fact I would say AI behavior is the biggest flaw in this game.\n_________________________________________________________\n\nConclusion:  Depsite the cons, which are in my opinion really kinda minor when it comes to the rest of this game,  Galactic Civilizations III is one of the very top 4x strategy games on the market at this very moment.  Very engaging and beautiful, I tip my hat to you Stardock... well done.  I look forward to see what else you bring to this game and series.","October 3, 2015","true","96.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Demonweed/recommended/226860/","Demonweed","Demonweed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Demonweed/","141 products in account","I've been playing Galactic Civilizations from the start of the series.  Fans of the earlier titles are likely to enjoy this iteration.  Most of the core ideas are well-implemented, and the look of the game is appropriately updated.  Particular highlights include a more diverse body of random events (even before obtaining the Mega Events DLC), an ideological system, race-specific tech trees, and an incredibly nuanced ship designer.  Of course, there is robust support for custom-designed content, which should proliferate as the playerbase grows.\n\nFor people unfamiliar with the series, Galactic Civilizations is about competitive empire-building.  In the standard game, a player begins with a spacefaring race still limited to its homeworld.  Simultaneously managing exploration, settlement, economic development, technological growth, and security concerns; the aim is to colonize distant worlds and thrive.  Victory conditions often include peaceful options like diplomacy or even transcending physical existence itself, though violent conquest is also on the list.  Managing large happy colonies provides the resources to attempt the loftiest goals.\n\nHaving played many games in this 4X genre, I feel Galactic Civilizations III strikes a nice balance between accessibility and complexity.  It is possible to control every detail right down to the placement of decorative fins on warships, but delegating to the AI to focus on high-level questions and strategic command is also a viable approach.  I don't yet have enough experience to have a strong opinion about the AI, but I find the normal difficulty setting suitable for learning the ropes.  Ideology is a particular treat, giving significant consequence to the morality of crucial choices.  For players willing to put in the time a serious strategy game demands, Galactic Civilizations III should provide many hours of pleasant satisfaction.","October 3, 2015","true","122.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why?\n(Firstly, not one image in the videos is from actual game footage. Do not be deceived. This game relies on marketing to sell it. If you knew what I knew, you would not buy this game as it is broken in terms of functioning code and game design).\n\nOk, some points about my game experience:\n(you can check every point in the game and they are all factual events. My opinion is not fact but it reflects my observence of these facts in the game)\n\n1 - Crashes every 15-30 minutes on insane mode due to memory leaks. I know it's memory leaks because there are arrays being created but not deleted or reused. Too much data is being accumulated somewhere and it results in the game becoming increasingly slower and slower and finally crashing and instantly going to desktop and closes the game.\n\nYou will have a new appreciation for saving your progress between autosaves when you have long periods of time per turn before the next auto-save. Especially if you just spent 20 minutes cleaning out obsolete units to try and help the game become faster.\n----------\n2 - The space battles look ok at first but after a while you'll notice that it looks like all the spaceships are controlled by drunk drivers who love nothing better than to fly around like a dead goldfish in a whirlpool. This happens as they get closer and the maker seems to have a bad sense of what looks acceptable.\n----------\n3 - Sound often crashes. To overcome this flaw in coding: the music must be turned off and then back on - don't ask me why but it fixes the sound error. Sometimes the game will become unresponsive but not crash and return to windows. When you can no longer interact with anything, just save your current game in a new slot and re-load your game.\n----------\n4 - Computer AI cheats. I have it's bases totally surrounded and it magically creates armies and bases out of nothing in the middle of nowhere. Then the AI will tell me it surrenders and yet I still have to kill it anyway. Don't know if this is a bug or the game designer has a twisted idea of the word 'surrender'. Seriously, cheating is a last ditch effort for programmers who cannot make adaptive AI.\n----------\n5 - the game should be fun but I found it more tedious than my previous job doing data entry of government records OR data entry for Toyota.\nWhy would I say this? There are few shortcuts to do anything in the game. You cannot mass delete, mass rally to a location, or even mass select other than stacking and making a fleet. There are no checkboxes or CTRL+Select to make selective deletion possible.\n\nYou have to do many things individually and honestly this game felt more like a horrible job except that I'm the one paying to do it.... The hotkeys mentioned online do not work in most cases. "Y" works for yes, the working hotkeys are visible in tooltips but the online suggestions mostly do not work.\n----------\n6 - Just when you thought you were moving a slider to look at ships in a list, the tooltip blocks most of the list so you cannot even see what you are looking at.\n----------\n7 - the icons on the minimap are single pixels. Yes, you heard correctly, single pixels!!! Get ready for purple dot units on a purple background for it's team color. THe minimap is so bad I wanted to vomit, eat my vomit, poop it out, eat it again and vomit it again. It will provide hours of frustration as you squint to see wtf you are looking at. Also ship icons in groupings are impossible to recognize because they are just reduced scale images of large pictures. This results in "WTF is that?" moments and you have to then open up another menu to see what is what.\nAnd I'm using a 24" screen 1900x1200 and the minimap is still terrible. Same color for ships on same color for your area of control....so bad....high school art class FTW...\n----------\n8 - The production and rally points are so messy that you'll find half your army hidden in buildings that you never intended them to be in.\n----------\n9 - I make games for a living and so that's partly why I'm so critical. However the game does have it's promising moments but most likely you'll be forcing yourself to play because you paid 40~70 dollars depending on what country you live in. I paid 70 :(\n----------\n10 - The game just isn't fun at all - that's my final opinion after I completed an 'insane size map' that took me 20 hours+ (probably another 2 hours if I include the lost time due to crashes).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nConclusion:\n----------\nStrategy:\nThe only strategy really is to look at what weapons your enemy's ships have, what armor they have, and then choose the best rock, paper, scissor effect to win fights. The technology you choose should support how you want to play. Influence to steal bases, Friendly to win an alliance win, military to win fights and research to help you get an edge in whatever style you choose. Research alone will not win the game unless you choose that goal.\n----------\nCreativity:\nIf you want to be creative in this game, you'll be very sad. The game has little opportunity for creativity and any startrek / starwars fetishes you have will be crushed when you see the ships floating like dead goldfish in a whirlpool. Yes, you can make spaceships with existing parts however the spaceships update so much and the game is so repetitive AND the battle scenes are so horrible that your art will be spat on by the current game design.\n----------\nReward System:\nThe main rule is that the inefficient player will lose to the AI. So your first few games will be hard but once you have those "ah~~~I see " moments where you realise how to beat the AI, you'll finish it easily but it will just take lots of time.\nLack of patience is punished in this game.\n----------\nUser Interface:\nPatience is also punished because this game makes you a full time data entry person thanks to a useless user interface (UI) which only caters for short games where the structure and unit count is smaller. When you have like 400 of these, the game's UI fails and just shows a blank screen beyond about 200 units in the list. Really helpful when the spaceship you want is at the bottom of the list and the filters don't move it to the top.\n----------\nPrice and Music:\nSorry to be critical but that's the way I am. I paid $70 for the game and I expected a $70 game but this seems more like a fancy prototype / alpha game. I wouldn't call it a beta because it was so buggy I really imagine the programmer to be inexperienced and not an eye for detail or design principles. Art is average but I'm very critical. Oh, and Music is AWFUL...thank goodness for 3rd party music players. Really, really depressing music with no passion in it.\n----------\nClosing Thoughts:\nOnce again, sorry for being so critical but I earned that right when I paid $70 for a game that would have been fair if it was sold for $20~25\n\nNow when I read the following quote:\n\n"You must be running 64-bit Windows 7 or later to play Galactic Civilizations III. This requirement allows us to create the largest, most advanced, strategy game possible."\n\n- I believe this translates into:\n\n"You need 64-bit because my coding is so bad that a 32 bit OS will fail very quickly because I can't clean arrays or debug my game. In other words, I'll break through my lack of coding skill by using your 64 OS to extend the life of my memory leaks."\n----------\nLesson Learned:\nI learned what kind of game design is less effective. This in turn helped me become a better game programmer. I'd avoid this game like the plague until the price comes down. Too late for me, can't be bothered reversing the transaction and having my Steam account limited until they work out why I reversed the bank transaction.","October 21, 2015","false","41.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I have no hesitation in recommending this game to 4x players. The game is really good, no question.\n\nThe devs have made a lot of progress since release; and 1.4 is a big improvement for the ai - for me most notably is that the ai won't spam starbases everywhere anymore.\n\nMy fav things:\n- tech tree is so much better than galciv2\n- nebulae and other stellar background (like black holes)\n- strategic resources\n- ship designer - it is insanely good\n- building on planets is beautiful, smooth and satisfying (especially the adjacency mechanic - making this nicely strategic)\n\nIssues:\n- still buggy in places (but have never had a full on crash). Two bugs for me are that the ai spams messages which are clearly not relevant; and some information doesn't refresh straight away creating some genuine confusion as to what is happening.\n- feature light-ish (this is only a comment in relation to galciv 2, it still has a great many features). I'm sure expansions will correct this and go beyond galciv 2; as it stands in no way is galciv 3 an incomplete game.\n- small payable dlc ... why are these things not in base game kinda thing\n\nSummary:\nGameplay is unquestionably fun, the world is immersive, the sound design is great and the ai is a challenge. This is a good 4x game and I look forward to further patches, development and of course the three planned expansions.\n\nGo buy.\n\nEDIT: forgot to say how awesome the multiplayer is, smooth and crisp. The game is also 64 bit which is a massive step up from galciv 2 creating what I can only describe as a brilliant play experience with no lag experienced yet.","October 30, 2015","true","145.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked the soundtrack, the gameplay, and the look.  The most recent patch has "overhauled" (Read: dumbed down) economic management to the point that the game is just not worth playing at all. Managing the research, production, and wealth of my empire and striking a balance between the three was what I really liked-the war isn't bad or a chore by any means but it's really just not where I found the meat of the gameplay to be. Now that governing my planetary budget is forcibly automated there's nothing to DO. Even the vaunted (and very fun, I might add) player-created starships have gotten hit by this change-now that you can no longer put 100% of a planet's outcome into military production all the player-made ships are too expensive to produce in any kind of reasonable timeframe.\n\nTL;DR:the meat of the gameplay was almost entirely removed in a patch, game is boring now.","October 8, 2015","false","90.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are several things in the games that *should* releive the level of micromanagement, but they don't work how you would like. There is a global production governence that allows you to drive your indistry, but having one item for your entire empire makes things difficult. if you are primarily working on research, newer planets suffer when they could be building up their infrastructure, and provide fulfilling help to the empire, but instead being on the global governence they will contribute a pitence of research and almost never build up their infristructure. prior to 1.4 each planet could have its own governence but this became a nightmare of micromanagement when you had a large number of planets. they created an interesing  "in-between" that allows you to divirert things but in my opinion it is not enough to help balence things where they were before.\n\nThe game has the ability to rely on the provided ai to assist with some of the micomanagement, however the AI is horible. It builds things almost at random, and the ship designs are just as worse.\n\nLast complaint is the space stations. it takes roughly 35 constor modules to fully build up a space station. the AI will only create constructors with only one construcotor modules, but with some work ones with 10+ modules can be created but it requires you to specifically send them roughout the univers instead of using the "oh so conviennt" request constructor button, which only uses the base constuctor. So instead of creating 2 ships for a fully build base it requires the 35.\n\nThese are my biggest complaints. Overall though I enjoy the game as it is nice and relaxing. I just hate the 10 minutes I spend every turn directing my ships and orginizing my planets. If they can fix these things I will change my review but overall I give it an (7/10).","October 31, 2015","false","293.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no encyclopedia function and the tutorial was not very helpful for anything but the most basics.

If you are a fan of GC2, man oh man, you should own this. A lot of people would say that this game doesn't innovate enough, and there may be some value to their opinion. This is basically the same game, putting in a new and interesting campaign, polished up with nice graphics, with extra layers put in. Adjacency bonuses are one of the few new things in the game, a simple addition, but the fact that it makes you think about the layout of each of your planets, tickles something in me. It is a big step up from OG GC2 though, maintaining most of the innovations from the completed effort of both expansion packs. So if you go into it expecting a groundbreaking new game, you will be disappointed. But if you are a fan of the game, and can appreciate a completely rebuilt engine, polishing up what you loved for 2015. This is the game for you. *Sidenote* I invested 100$ in the elite founders pack. I know something like this is always a risk, but I am willing to bet on the company that bought us dark avatar, and twilight of the arnor. So that's it.

I've explored this game quite a bit and still I see myself getting back to this game in the future. Diplomacy and tech trading is important too, it's not just something you can ignore, so that's nice. Combat is simplified but the different weapon types and tech choices you have to make keep the tension on early on. Overall, I'd recommend this game without hesitation, and I should add that you don't need a total beast of a computer to play on pretty huge maps, the game remains stable and running smoothly.\n\nThe one thing that could be improved is with (micro)managing planets. It works perfectly when you have 10 planets at the start of a game, but it gets annoying once you start conquering neighbours and terraforming your planets, and it's just a total pain when you're going for a conquest victory with 100+ planets. Maybe a macromanager for planets, beyond production / science / money levels, with a build order that could be customized and applied?","July 27, 2015","true","127.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Starrbases are horribly underpowered and weak with pitiful range. You can play games with the AI to keep them from destroying certain assest where a Human player would just ignore. There needs to be tactics settings when your ships goto battle, at least some interaction rather than just watching random outcomes. The tech tree is confusing at 1st, there needs to be a little more explination on the benifits and detriments to a particular choice, otherwise you have to figure it out by trial and error and the games can be long and you find out you made a poor choice 5 plus hours into a game.

In order to make this a helpful review I'll review different points below.\n\n\nGood stuff:\n------------\n- The game has interesting races to choose from and in addition has excellent functions for you to make your very own custom race including; racial traits, different leader/race pictures, starting system planetary setup and so on.\n\n- Excellent automation options. You can set rally points and many other parameters for ALL shipyards, and so on, via a very simple and fast menu, no hassle at all to manage a sprawling empire.\n\n- Very good ship customization. This isn't something I use as I lack the patience for it, but if you like to decide how your ships should look then you can spend a LOT of time in the ship builder!\n\n- Nice cutscenes and pictures when you colonize and gain resources. I'd like more of them though since they set the tone and atmosphere in the game.\n\n- Not all planets are equal. Some planets will have more/less building space than others. You CAN develope them so they can house more imprevements, but only to a degree. I like this, this makes planets different and you would do well to protect your more precious planets.\n\n- Space battles. I actually like that you have no direct control over battles. I'm the leader of the nation, not the admiral in the fleet.\n\n\n\n- Bad stuff: (Some of this stuff is more about my own personal preferance rather than objectively negative things)\n------------\n- The game could have used more immersion than it currently has. Perhaps more specific and different UI:s or so.\n\n- For me personally the mid game turns much into a click fest where I just press "next turn". I suspect that this has to do with me playing too passively and too peacefully.\n\n- I'm also not a fan of how planets are developed. Buildings of the same type give proxomity bonii to buildings of the same type. This is a true and tried mechanic but, without being able to give an example of a  "better" system, I would have liked a different logistics systems.\n\n- Space battles. This is my first GC game so I have no idea how battles were modelled before. But battles look a little silly. Ships bump into each other and circle/wobble around each other in a drunken fashion making the ships look like little rubber toys rather than advanced warships engaging in deadly space battles.","August 25, 2015","true","101.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

ART was neglected big time, the graphic design the user experience design, the 3d graphics are not good. zooming in and out is not working well, the background images of the univerese are not looking good.\n\n\n2. Music theme is also very similar with the old one. which is a good thing to have some recognisible tunes but bad if it sounds exactly the same.

I've always been a fan of turn-based stratagy games and the sci fi element is one of my favorites. This game's strong points definitely shine through in its very indepth customization at the beginning which is only as complicated as you make it. Your decisions at all stages of the game have a real effect across the galaxy and after a couple play-throughs you really start to grasp the intricacies and the game really starts to bloom. There are ways to exploit (or break, depending on your viewpoint) certain game mechanics but they are easy to avoid for as much emersion as a turn-based stratagy game can offer.

I didn't get pulled into a war until ~400 turns in, which means I was just improving buildings for about two hours straight. Going to war early doesn't feel worth it since it costs so many credits to upgrade your ships to the latest version. AIs seem to have a static personality for now, which means every game they'll act exactly the same way (Krynn always seem to hate me no matter what). Unlike Civilization, where you can own a single city and still manage to win on even the hardest difficulty, expanion is a must here. But, to combat this, colonizing new planets does NOT affect your overall happiness as it does in Civ.\n\nThe combat system is just beautiful. Cinematic views of battles are amazing, and feel very rewarding if you're on the winning side. Likewise, the cinematics throughout the game feel polished and rewarding; whether it's colonizing your first planet or building your first starbase, the game makes it feel like an actual accomplishment.\n\n\nIf you have money to blow, get this game. If not, wait for a sale. Though the game is lacking a bit right now, as most 4X games do when they're new, I trust that it will continue to expand, and eventually justify its price tag.","August 14, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As of late summer 2015, the game has a few rough edges which could use polishing (sub-optimal path plotting while moving units and stale UI panel components are probably the biggest 2 for me right now). However, Stardock has released updates recently addressing other flaws, indicating this not EA style abandonmed-ware.\n\nMost importantly:  the fundamentals foundation of GC3 appears stout. At the risk of sounding like a fan-boy, my assessment is this is currently the premier turn based strategy game on the market. This game supports the requisite feature set and strategic warfare dynamics I expect out from this genre, which the forefunner competitor's latest generation of titles should have but do not.\n\nKudos to Stardock for finding a working formula, sticking with it, and judiciously knowing how far to go with incremental evolution.","August 15, 2015","true","461.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not cool StarDock, not cool.\n\nThat said, game's out of early access and it's decent. It's a decidedly better-than-average 4X game, and the best of the GalCiv series so far in my opinion. It's worth your money now that it sells for a sane price.\n\nThe strategic elements are pretty well polished, though I have some late game quibbles with the auto-commands. In particular, there's a critical absence of any kind of patrol command which leaves you micromanaging fleets to chase down small ships. There's also some major balance issues with sensor ships. (You can load a single ship's entire mass with sensors, park it at a star base, and have complete sensor omniscience for the rest of the game for the low, low cost of a single non-combat ship.)\n\nThe ship designer is a little awkward in spots, with controls reversing depending on camera orientation and other annoying quirks, but it allows for a lot of creativity. The workshop is full of stuff pulled from other universes, which I personally don't like, but that's sci-fi games for you. All anyone thinks to make are Star Destroyers and the Enterprise.\n\nIn a nutshell, there are better 4X games out there, but this one's not a bad one, particularly if it's on sale or if they get around to fixing balance and bugs.","August 9, 2015","true","32.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I highly recommend buying this game at any price; you will be well rewarded. I will list some of the more interesting pros of this game.\n1.  Tech research: The game breaks the tech tree into 3 ages. In order to advance from one age to another the player has to complete a significant amount of research in all the tech trees of the current era. You might be a able to race to the end of the military related techs of the current age but you will not be able to advance to the next age in military techs until you have done about 85% of all the techs of that age.\n2.  Map size:  On its largest scales I have never seen a game map with larger maps.\n3.  Ship customization: This game allows you the player to make your ships as complex looking or not depending on your desire to express your creativity.  I for one like to make simple custom changes and then I just want to add components wherever they will fit.  This game will satisfy everyones desire to create complex designs.\n4.  AI:  At its higher settings this game will give you a serious run for your money.\n\nBuy this game and play it.","August 10, 2015","true","150.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Game is an improvement over Gal Civ II\n\nThe research tree is better in that it is not laid out from the start - but you discover it.  Bigger maps = better\n\nsuggested improvements -\n(1) Bring back miners on astroids as a way to increase planet production\n(2) Rebalance cost of producing ships - at game start the colony ship costs 58 to 62 turns ,  quickly it becomes 300 to 500 turns which kills the game - possible solution - allow players to build older models of ship designs  the old M-1 Colony would be cheeper but slower and less range which is fine.\n(3)  The special perks (items) that a few of the planets have - tool tips need to better describe their effect if any\n(4) On the "manage planet" screen and the Manage starbase" screen - let the small map that normally appears in the upper right that shows the whole known galaxy and the individual planet/starbase location on it appear -  location may mean different selections for actions - and on turns where I start 2 planets or 2 starbases it is difficult to know which is which\n(5) Let the operator (game player) give names to rally points - the computer generated names are not helpful\n(6)  Some of the color selections are difficult to see  -  insufficient contrast  -  example the yellow box in the galaxy screen that is usually in the upper right of the screen.  Yellow is a goos contrasting color but the pixel width of the lines in that screen renders it invisible\n(7) In the tactical battles - give the player options of say (a) all ships shoot at enemy ship closest to them or (b) all ships shoot at most dangerious ship in weapons range or (c) ??\n(8) Create a on line game instruction book - that at lease gives the basics.\n\nThanks for making a good game - and hope you are able to continue its evolution.","March 12","true","112.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I loved the customization for the game you could practilly spend hours withot even playing the game and still have a ton of fun. make what you want. I created my own rce in the game and it's awsome. and the ship designer along with factions and the workshop incorporated in the game. that can bring some more replayablility due to custom faction and make thing like x wings from star wars, or the enterprise from star trek.\n\n2. the gameplay is solid. you have 8 races to play with their own uniqe traits and this can effect how you play and adds more time to replay value for the game. if your a fan of space/si-fi game this will be your dream game. running you very own empire the way you want and conquer the galaxy. A side note, I'd like to thank Angry Joe for streaming this game months ago, if it wasnt for that i would not be playing this game. the game is rich in content and feel just like an RPG, but in SPACE!\n\nNow what are some thing that disappointed me or didn't like\n\n1. No local Multiplayer but it does have online multiplayer so there that\n2. There were some issues (for me at least) that the game crashed somtime while loading the designer screen where you design ship i had that happen about 2 times so it does crash and have bugs\n3. the A.I. is a bit of a pushover if your playing on lower difficultys. and with that (and i can't comfirm that this happens on higher difficultys above normal) it lead to exploiting some things with the A.I. like wearing down opposing fleets that im at war with useing shipyards. So i would recommand you play on higher difficultys that is above normal. though it doesn't work all the tim but it can happen with smaller fleet sizes and having a tone of preduction to produce shipyards about every turn at will.\n4. the cainpain was surpisingly short there are three campain maps though it does make up for it in time with objectives and bigger maps. at least it's not 4 hours. at least i think it is.\n\nNow i would recommand this game but only if you like sitting at your compter for hours and have a beast machine and play for hours. if you have a low end pc it might not be the greatest thing to buy but once you get a better pc then get this game.\n\n\n","September 6, 2015","true","390.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played GalCiv II before 3 was made and really enjoyed it, but it was getting on in years and it showed a little.  When I then heard that GalCiv III was in the works, I pre-purchased it here on Steam, and even tried out the Beta a bit.  It wasn't nearly complete at the time, so I put it down for a while.  Then I played a very similar game called Endless Space, and it reminded me of GalCiv, but was also missing a lot…and I do mean A LOT (don't play it, it'll only disapoint you).  So I came back to GalCiv III, thinking that it must certainly be finished by now, and I was not disapointed at all.  It is a simply wonderful game if you like extensively deep turn-based strategy and civilization-simulator games.  It has excellent customization ability, allowing you to truly create a civilization all your own, and design/build ships that are truly unique.  The campaign is also quite intriguing, and will captivate you if you take the time to thoroughly read the dialogues and experience the story.\n\nAfter playing again for a little while, I then went and bought all the DLC without thinking twice about it.  As I said before…not at all disapointed.  Some of the best money I've ever spent on a game.","January 11","true","91.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the other hand there is not much evolution from gc II and the game almost looks like a replica of it with no substantyial add-on. The 3D map is nice to see but maybe too much heavy for not top-rated hardware, and there is not much video settings as well to overcome this issue, resulting in very clumsy map navigation. The campaign its really disappointing: only 3 (small) maps, too short and too easy. Kinematics clips rather poor too. As in previous version the best feature still remains the ship designer,  which on the other hand makes me wish for some more interactive 3D battles which is entirely missing.

However, the majority of the techs are the same as 2.\n\nThe Graphics are better, but to be honest this type of game not that big of an issue.\n\nThe sound again is almost the same as 2.\n\nThe reason I would say buy it is the fun of the type of game.  So many games become out dated and never updated well or changed to much.  GC hasn't really changed to heavily.  They keep what works.

It's also possible to buy ships from an ally in exchange for technology, then use their own ships to invade them. :) You can also bankrupt an enemy, as I did, by buying loads of ships from allies then gift them to an enemy, the upkeep then destroys their econimy XD.\n\nPersonally I focus on food, growth and science, I also focus on one thing at a time normally... the mechanics are more or less fine, it's really just the interface which I dislike because like I said finding things like my ships, planets and star bases can be tricky.","September 8, 2015","true","58.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are also some bugs that come back. To their defence they do get rid of them usually.\nMulti player is not my thing so will leve that info for someone else.\nIf one wants to learn this from scratch they can go to Steam manuals, GC web page, youtube for Stardock and Macsen.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/stardockgames\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/MacsenGaming/videos","May 2, 2015","true","933.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

Now, I really want to like this game.  I have tried.  I have played hours of it, but the game simply does not do it for me.  Overall, the game mechanics, the content, the tech-tree, ships, etc. on offer is plenty and varied.  However, the game, for me is too much of a reskin of GC II, which is not to say that is a bad thing, but it would seem the developers did not aim to improve upon the old game with the new.\n\nMy biggest gripe with GC III is the mundane, haphazard, and back-seated approach to combat.  There is virtually (if any at all) player interaction during combat.  The player assembles a fleet of ships, sends them against an enemy fleet and simply watches the combat unfold.  Of course, the player upgrades one's ships and develops military techology as a way to enhance the fighitng capacity and abilities, but in no way can one direct anything during combat in real time or in turn based.  This is a lost opportunity.  The devs could have really gone out and made combat interactive, and improved the old game systems with new mechanics in the new game.\n\nA general criticism, completely shrouded in my own subjective leanings, is that the game is not immersive at all.  The music, the environment, the galaxy, the races, and so on just feels bland.  I do not get any sense that the galaxy is a living and breathing arena filled with races, wars, trade, and diplomacy.  Of course, all of these things do happen, but there is no real sense of signicance from these interactions that gives me a sense of immersion.\n\nI would personally not recommend this game to those players wishing for a more interactive combat system.  However, the game overall offers enough content, graphical fidelity, and overall competence for me to give it a very, very lukewarm recommendation.\n\n\n\n","February 27","true","18.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played GalCiv II before 3 was made and really enjoyed it, but it was getting on in years and it showed a little.  When I then heard that GalCiv III was in the works, I pre-purchased it here on Steam, and even tried out the Beta a bit.  It wasn't nearly complete at the time, so I put it down for a while.  Then I played a very similar game called Endless Space, and it reminded me of GalCiv, but was also missing a lot…and I do mean A LOT (don't play it, it'll only disapoint you).  So I came back to GalCiv III, thinking that it must certainly be finished by now, and I was not disapointed at all.  It is a simply wonderful game if you like extensively deep turn-based strategy and civilization-simulator games.  It has excellent customization ability, allowing you to truly create a civilization all your own, and design/build ships that are truly unique.  The campaign is also quite intriguing, and will captivate you if you take the time to thoroughly read the dialogues and experience the story.\n\nAfter playing again for a little while, I then went and bought all the DLC without thinking twice about it.  As I said before…not at all disapointed.  Some of the best money I've ever spent on a game.","January 11","true","91.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just a few cons that come randomly in my mind:\n\n1. The game consumes a lot of a system's resources making it “unpleasant” to run for your computer, especially if it is a couple of generations behind (Even with quad core SPU, 8Gig of memory and an GTX 550 GPU). Personal experience in first boot of the game started with a crash on desktop, not the best way for a “first contact”...\n2. You just cant get some info at a simple glimpse like you did with its precursor. For example you have to hover the cursor over a selected unit to see it's movement info which is not displayed in the left bottom corner of the unit dialog box.\n3. Ship types in the designer and the shipyard are sorted by default in a way that it is not helpful. An ability to sort theme out via attributes (especially by hull size) and keep things organized is not possible.\n4. One should expect to see some features of previous galsiv releases be improved and new ones added. But the ones added do not make such a great impact in the game and unfortunately others have been removed or simplified (e.g politics).\n5. Research, well for the standard of a game at such a level, is surprisingly poor(!) especially for one that inevitably makes comparisons with Galsiv II. It is shallow and generalized and even though the science screen in a first glimpse looks nice and developed with new features, some things are poorly designed (e.g the tech tree where you can't zoom in and out).\n6. Surely the game is well polished especially with it's graphics, sound, artwork, etc... but maybe over polished on how it is presented and missing the essence.\n\nIn the other hand the AI of the game seems to be smart and quiet challenging even in normal difficulty mode. Ship designer is great and really exciting. But most of all the game has character and personality which is the timeless quality that distinguishes all galsiv series from the competition.\n\nSumming it up; Is it worth buying it? Well, if you are a newbie in space 4X games then go for Galsiv II which even though is older, still is way ahead in the competition (and guess it will stay for a long time). However get it if you find it in a special price. If you have experience in this genre of games and you have devoted some gameplay hours in the galsiv franchise but you are sort of a hypochondriac person then don't. Just wait some time until the devs do what they have to do and improve things with future updates (which thankfully are frequent). And finally, if you are a strategy game addict and space 4X junkie (like me) than it is a must!\n\nUpdate_Jan_2016\n\nSome new updates have been released since I bought the game. The result is less sleeping, less work and more wife nagging ... so I guess that the game is on the right track !","October 4, 2015","true","365.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I recently came back to it with GC III. The game is fun but the learning curve seems to be a bit steeper than I remember. It seems like the only strategies that work now are the “Rush” strategies. I used to go science heavy. I’m sure that I’m just relearning it though. There is a lot of replay ability to this game and I still find myself having trouble not clicking “next turn”. I’m looking forward to future game balance patches but ultimately I think the game is a lot of fun.","February 9","true","101.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately GC3 is very unbalanced and boring comparing to GC2 and GC1. For now I'm abandoning this game for GC2Ultimate - maybe I'll give it another try after great balance patch or good expansion.","February 9","false","43.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
