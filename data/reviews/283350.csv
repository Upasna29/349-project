The gameplay is a little complicated in my opinion even after reading the manual, the success rate of the guided missiles is low even against non-moving targets, is possible to control the fighter with the mouse but I think this is too unconvenient in the dogfight, in addition you dont have ruddle control.\n\nIt works perfectly on windows 8.1 64x\n\nIn conclusion, a very interesting concept but not a very functional implementation.","March 25, 2015","false","13.4"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","0"

The flight model is not hardcore, but for the time it came out it is very decent, and you get G visual and sound effects.\n\nThe only thing wrong with the game is that you have to edit a file and run it to get a proper resolution, because the config tool doesn't work. And also some people have reported problems when trying to run it, like the game not loading. Also a manual would be nice, but with a bit of trial and error you will get to know the keys and what do the markers mean, etc...\n\n\nNormally I would give this a negative review because all the problems we get in this version, and because the publishers/devs/people who brought it to steam don't seem to care enough, and haven't solved this problems yet...
