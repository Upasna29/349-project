Its Graviteam Tactics...\n\nEither you love it, hate it, confuses you or you never heard of it.\n\nFollowing up Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star is a pair of large britches to fill.   One of the most realistic RTS sort of games out there.  In fact RTS is to shallow a term to use to describe Mius Front or Operation Star.  Battalion level simulator is more apt a description.  Unlike the dark days for the Red Army in 1942 to early 1943 that Operation Star depicts, Mius Front is summer 1943.  The Red Army is on the offensive, everywhere.  As this takes place after Kursk for the most part and a bit south of that epic clash, the Wehrmacht is on the fence and no longer is the Red Army just trying to hold ground.  Its time to start taking things back.\n\nSo whats different?   Most game assets have gotten a face lift.  GTOS looked good, this looks better.  A heck of a lot has changed.  THe UI, a new Artillery ribbon with lots of nasty shells to select for off screen guns,   air power comes in gaint flights and is MUCH more lethal and of course some new tanks, armored cars, and an anti tank gun.  The morphing land that got Steel Armor: Blaze of Wars tracks digging into the ground.  Watch your hapless tank in bad ground dig itself into the ground if you ordered it somewhere stupid, like a marsh.  A new tutorial system that while basic, gets the point across for the junior Hans Guderian in us all.\n\nThe game is based on reality.  Do not expect an army of Tiger tanks everywhere.  The Germans only made around 1300 of them.  Reality takes the front seat.  The land is made from satellite elevation data and it helps that Graviteam is located not far at all from this battle sight.  In the campaigns German and Red Army historical documents where consulted for units and their equipment.  Reality here and truth to history are king.\n\nSo do you have what it takes to command multiple companies and battalions?  Well get to it Colonel.....the Army is waiting on you!\n\n\n\nEdit.  Based on negative reviews....\n\nIf you are expecting a main streamed RTS click game you totally DO NOT WANT THIS GAME.  This thing is more tacitcal simulation than rock, paper, scissors.  That does not exist here.  Click bait RTS is mindless fun, this is mindful mass murder simulator.","March 4","true","611.1"," 202 of 222 people (91%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","91","202","222","20","34"

The German observer quietly calls in his corrections...\n\nThe second shell explodes feet away from the southernmost soviet squad, fuse set for airburst the shockwave propels molten shrapnel outwards slamming into Earth and flesh, there is panic, men are screaming, the Soviet commander tries to get his platoon to pull back as the spotter whispers into the telephone handset 'perfect, fire at wi...'.. at that very moment a flight of Soviet ground attack aircraft carpet bombs the hilltop killing everyone.\n\n10/10 would forget to look up again.\n\n\n\nIf you never heard of this series and you love wargaming, historical RTS, WW2... oh boy are you in for a treat. Warning - this game kills most other RTS type games, once you tasted this beauty the rest just won't do it for you anymore.\n\nThere is nothing quite like this out there, it's not a traditional RTS, it's an uber realistic battlefield simulator, ballistics, damage, command & communications networks, resupply, weather conditions, day night cycle... all realistically modelled.\n\nMassive and accurately recreated battlefields that can be deformed by trenches and ordinance damage.\n\nCampaigns based on actual operations and are hisorically accurate to the tiniest details, all the units in the game were there at the time.\n\nOperational mode, campaign management, platoon organization, resupply, strategic manouvering.\n\nTactical mode, atmospheric real time battles that look and feel extremely authentic.\n\nAI that never does the same thing twice, no 2 operations will ever play out the same way twice, virtually unlimited replayability.\n\nA powerful Battle editor that allows you to design and customize  your own battles.\n\nYears in the making, compared to its predecessor, the great 'Operation Star' this is a massive leap forwards, the UI, command system, sounds, graphics, optimization have all been significantly improved and numerous new features added.\n\nFor grognards this is as good as it gets, the developers have a proven track record in supporting their games for years after release, DLC's will come with new operations, new units and new maps, there is even the very tantalizing possibility of multiplayer being added in the future.\n\nDon't take my word for it, read the reviews, visit the forum and see what other players think, then pull the trigger, buy it, this is the one!","March 5","true","36.1"," 99 of 112 people (88%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","88","99","112","11","1"

You just have to find it.\n\nI want you to look at the highest rated pictures for Graviteam Mius. That is how the game feels once you learn to play it. But you have to learn it, and it takes time, and before you do it won't look or play at all how the pictures feel. When I first bought Graviteam's other game, Operation Star, I had heard good things about it but was sorely dissapointed the first couple times I tried playing. It just didn't seem to "have it". I let it go for a couple months.\n\nBut then I came back, and really tried to learn it. Turns out, I was completely wrong. If you like WW2 and strategy, it's a crime not to devote a couple hours to learning this game if you can. It's one of, if not the best.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edox93/recommended/312980/","edox93","Edox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edox93/","84 products in account","Probably the best wargame of this scale around.\nIn this game you get the feeling of being a commander, moving companies and platoons: you aren't the micromanaging-wierdo which we see in many games, where an hypotetical ww2 "general" go from soldier to soldier telling him where to aim, take cover behind that rock, switch to that grenade. In Mius Front the AI can handle that, and while you can certainly micromanage the placement of an AT gun in an ambush position, or should the need arise command single squad in a platoon, you do it only when you need it.\nThe game has a turn-based operational layer, where you move platoons and manage your force calling reinforcements from your OOB. When the movement phase ends battles are resolved in the tactical mode, where you not only get to move troops in the field, but can also please your eyes at the really nice graphics, unrivalled in a game of this genre, which mantains a solid grip on realism and historical accuracy. In fact OOBs are historically accurate ( you will not see hordes of Tigers) and also gun penetration and vehicle damage mechanics are nicely modelled, without health bars which we see in too many games.\nFinally a HUGE plus of this game is the non-scripted AI. It's nice playing Combat Mission, but when you fall in that scripted ambush you will never fall for it again. Here nothing is apparently scripted: the AI can make good or stupid decisions, but will never make the same thing again over and over. This make the two campaigns (for each side) more replayable.\nDo not forget that there is also a battle editor, which allows for the creation of every battle you like using the campaign map.\nCompared to Operation Star there has been an improvement in the UI and several addictions, like better artillery support managament and tanks laying smoke for infantry to advance behind. Howewer, the sheer amount of content and campaigns of Operation Star with all the DLCs still make it worth buying imho.\nIf i have to complain about something that would be the actual lack of multiplayer (which howewer seems to be added at some point, maybe as a free dlc. There is already a MP option in the menu but only as a placeholder). The learning curve is pretty steep like many games of this genre, and for a newb even with the tutorial it may be hard to get into the game.\nAlso i hope they will make many DLCs like they did with GT:OS.\nFor the techical part, as of now i haven't had a single crash. There are some minor bugs, like two infantry soldier stacking on each other, or the tank sinking in soft ground mechanics which need some work.\nThe game is maybe a little less well optimized than his predecessor, with all things at maximum my GTX 670 can't always mantain 60fps, and in smoke cluster♥♥♥♥s fps can really drop. Still you can scale the graphics with many options.\n\nTL;DR version:\n+ best game of this scale\n+ two layers, operational and tactical\n+ nice graphics\n+ good approach (no need for excessive micromanaging)\n+ not scripted AI\n+ muh realism\n\n- multiplayer still to be added\n- steep learning curve for newbies of the genre","March 10","true","32.9"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","26","26","0","0"

But that doesn't mean it's a easy game, it is a terrifrically horrifically tremendously hard game. One does not simply win a battle in Graviteam Tactics: Mius-Front. Even if you do win, the cost will be high.\n\nGraviteam Tactics has improved a lot since Graviteam Tactics: Operation Star. Let's start with the graphics, they are very, if not tremendously satisfying, just looking at Infantry walking to the front lines makes you want to go with them and see what they are going to do. The graphics make screenshots look like 18th century war art (not in a bad way). It is just superb, well done Graviteam *claps*.\n\nSecondly the animations, they are wonderful, they are one of the most realistic movements, but they do become unrealistic when they either go through terrain or when they just switch to the other pose so rapidly that it just looks like a mess, but it is getting better.\n\nThirdly the gameplay (I am missing out 'music' because there isn't much music in the game, though it is the wonderful), the gameplay is a stockpile of fun, very good, wonderful even. I like when some of your men lay down covering fire and the rest charge, it just makes a epic cinematic (you do that with ctrl + back). In addition you can have allies/team mates (in the campaign as well). That's not all, you can make your own custom battles with the Battle Editor, just very well done Graviteam, GG.\n\nBut something to note is that there is bugs and the AI is weak and easy to exploit (unless you are a new player). One time it had the overall advantage, outnumbering me and entrenched on a hill, but it surrendered.\n\nFor this I rate it a 9.7/10 and if you like WW2 RTSs like CoH or MoW and your looking for a challenge I recommend it (for MoW veterans I highly recommend it)!\n\nIf they make multiplayer and do a Liberation of France Expansion, would be the best game ever, even HL3 can't beat it.\n\nSome epic ingame screenshots which are by me (at the time of the review):\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639254841\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639209644\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=639492750\n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that the community is really helpful, so if you have a problem just ask them.","March 6","true","9.0"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

It requires a real commitment to learn how to play. There will be some frustrations intially. But if you are willing to persevere, check out some YouTube tutorials and wargaming forums, do some trial and error, you will be rewarded by what may well be the greatest serious/historical tactical-level World War II game ever made.\n\nThe charges of the 'terrible' 'clunky' UI are overblown. Yes, the UI is *unique* -- it's unlike anything you've encountered elsewhere. It does take some getting used to. Yes, the documentation (manual) is lacking -- although the ingame tutorials are decent. But once you understand the UI, you will find it a flexible and powerful tool for managing the game and for crafting battlefield strategems that are surprisingly and satisfyingly multifaceted.\n\nI've seen some complaints about performance issues -- not sure what to say there, except that I've found Operation Star and now Mius Front both very stable (no crashes) and well optimized. I'm playing on a fairly robust rig (GTX 780 Ti, i7 3770K o/c to 4.6 GHz, 16 Gigs RAM) and the game is completely fluid on max graphics settings. And it is *gorgeous*. The modeling of terrain is amazing. And these are hands-down the most beautifully detailed vehicle models you  will find in a WW2 game.\n\nCannot recommend highly enough.

I usually HATE real time games. The only ones I've enjoyed are Command Ops series, the very first Close Combat games (esp CC2) and this series. Reason is they aren't a click fest and are manageable. Great to see this one runs along the same lines.\n\nWith the Battle Editor you have loads of replayability.\n\nAlso a tip, even veterans of the series MUST go through the tutorials scenarios and vids that you can find in Quick Battles. Helped me alot. Though still unsure of certain aspects..I reckon it will all sink in in time.\n\nAnyway just like the previous game it comes highly recommended.\n\nThis is a proper tactical wargame. It's not COH or MOW. For those wanting to get more "real"  and despite the UI you really must step it up and buy this game. The only other tactical wargame in 3D as complex is the Combat Mission series and they too come highly recommneded. I prefer the CM serie sonly because of the WEGO aspect in those games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prussianhussar/recommended/312980/","prussianhussar","Hofstadter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prussianhussar/","101 products in account","I am a very avid wargamer and have played a decent amount of titles, and this game is possibly one of the best wargames out there for its scope. There are several layers to wargames, strategic, operational, tactical and this game falls under the category of the last two for how the game plays out in its two phases. The first is a layer which shows a large map consisting of a company sized force. Which is organized down to battalion, platoon and at the lowest level, squad.\n\nThose that bought this game right away are fans of the first Graviteam game Operation Star, which was a gem in its own right but had its problems which come naturally from a Ukranian/Russian game studio. The most obvious of which is a very confusing user interface. Although it did change from GTOS there is an increased amount of abstraction but gives a decent amount of info. The first game allowed you to detach units from the reserve groups and manually attach them to platoons with a spare space. This is changed in this game because now you do not have the option to attach these reserves on a specific nature. Instead you choose the type on reinforcement on the management screen, and then hope you got what you wanted. For instance in the first you could move an anti tank rifle squad into a platoon, nice and simple, but now you would select "anti-tank" and you may get that squad, or a gun. If you select support you may get a mortar or an arty spotter. This simulates the "you get what you are given so stop complaining" nature of warfare but sacrifices control of platoon composition\n\nThe graphics are amazing, and are much improved from the last game. It looks great, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nSound is a bit to be desired with slightly cut off and strange sounding guns and explosions, however these will be modded in the near future. Going down close to soldiers also lets you hear them laughing...really...damn...awkwardly\n\nTactical battles are a work of art but leave a little to be desired in regards of unit control. This game simulates high level command so there is only so much you can control. All you can basically do is tell your units to move in a certain formation, face a direction and give target priorities. Although you can adjust the modifiers of how your units move in a neat radial menu. I would like to be able to adjust rate of fire, and grenade usage. However this will be forgotten in the heat of battle.\n\nAs I said before, the UI sucks. Its horrible, its ugly, and its only a minor improvement from GTOS. The manual does not help with this..\n\nLets conclude this haphazard review. This game is NOT for casual strategy fans, that comes out as elitist, but this game is designed for a very niche group of people called Grognards, these people play very abstracted games focused on wargames with a high level of complexity. This is reflected in the type of warfare that plays out which is primarily skirmisher warfare. Where units get into trenches, spot the enemy and fight a battle of attrition. You wont flank through gullys, charge a fortification or storm a building. You will be placing your units through forests and positioning at the edge for them to fire at the enemy. This is pure skirmisher warfare and it is not for those expecting a Company Of Heroes or Men of War Experience. Behind the bad UI is a beautiful gem of a wargame that can allow one to simulate high command on a operational and tactical level. Where you can give general orders to your units and hope they have the strength to carry them out. This game is for wargamers, and not for people looking for a quick campaign.","March 10","true","26.2"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","14","14","0","0"

They took what was good about the prior series and enhanced it to make a better game.   They did not try to reinvent the wheel which is good because we all know the wheel works well.\n\nGraphically it's the best looking game in the series.   The tutorials are a welcome addition and I learned a lot going through them as well as the players guide.  The landscape and terrain are well done and the roughness and variety of terrain make many tactical options possible that could not be done prior.   AI is as good or better in some cases as the prior games it seems.    Any fan of combnat mission or prior graviteam products should like this one.   For new players this is more of a tactical wargame with a high level of complexity, if expecting something like battlefield...don't.\n\n8.5/10 - highly recommend  .

If you're an armchair general like me and like games like wargame or men of war, and want something a bit more realistic and challenging this is the game for you. Only thing is, is that AI could use some improvements, they can be a bit janky, especially in close quarters situations, which you rarely end up in anyway. Could also use some more units and models, but more than likely these will be released in DLC similarly to GTOS. It's not your typical rts, but it scratches an itch not many games can come close to with it's level of realism, you don't fully control units, it's more like you're a commander issuing orders that the AI will carry out.

UI and operations take some learning and getting used to, but it's definitely worth it. Battles feel and look brutal, from your infantry getting lit on fire by a hostile flamethrower wielding soldier you didn't see sprint up to your trench on the flank, to a tank crawling up a hill containing your defensive positions, only to catch a shell to the fuel tank and burst into flames and roll back down to the bottom of the hill.\n\nNight battles can be either maddening or fantastic. Maddening in the sense of not being able to spot ♥♥♥♥ until you have Russian infantry cuddling up to your frontline soldiers in their trenches, fanstastic that a Russian tank will roll right between two dug in positions with infantry hitching a ride on the back and not know it until a grenade catches it in the side and disables a track, getting it's hitchhikers caught in a bulletstorm.\n\nAll in all, definitely a good purchase.

Hundreds of miniscule battlefield dramas unfold amongst the backdrop of massive clashes of infantry, tanks, planes and artillery.\n\nIf you look at what negative reviews exist, you'll see that they have extremely low playtime, which indicates they weren't able to get past the first UI hurdle. This is understandable - I'm still learning aswell - but dissapointing that they'll miss out on a game for not giving it more time and practice.","March 12","true","4.5"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

It was like trying to play a slideshow. Here's my updated review:\n\nGiven the fact that I've recently upgraded my rig (considerably) with upper level components, this game runs smooth as silk now. This is the best 'war' simulator you're going to get on the market. It takes some getting used to because it's not a typical RTS control system. If you're thinking about getting this, look up the YouTube videos, there's more being uploaded for this game everyday. But if you're REALLY leaning on getting this game, then you owe it to yourself to watch the tutorials on the Operation Star gameplay. While this game is much improved in many ways (UI is more intuitive, AI is better, etc...), the core gameplay and approach is pretty much the same between the two games. If the tutorials on YouTube for Operation Star seem like your cup of tea, then this is a game you will really learn to love.\n\nI'm looking forward to mods and DLC.\nThis game is HIGHLY recommended *If you and ONLY if you meet the recommended specs*","March 11","true","49.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Mius breaks new ground in Graviteam's steady march toward a true battlefield simulator.\n\nCompared to prior titles, Mius brings noticeably enhanced graphics, a more elegant interface, more units on the field, more complex AI behavior, more complex munitions, more extensive use of air support in combined arms combat, smoke screen, artillery fuse settings, and more.\n\nThe developers respond quickly to reports of flaws and they are always working on new features and DLCs.  Prices are always reasonable, but sale prices outright undervalue the game.\n\nAs with all Graviteam titles, Mius is not a game you can just pick up and play.  You have to learn the interface and commands, in addition to the funcitionality of all the weapons systems in the game.  You have to understand the effects of terrain, down to whether your heavy weapons can move through a muddy field.  You have to understand the effects of weather, such as how to deal with wind or storms.\n\nBeware that you will only find Mius' greatest rewards after extensive efforts to understand details of the battlefield.","March 7","true","26.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

At least for someone like myself with many years of real life military training and experience and that's one of the first games that's actually managed to just seamlessly blend a game with the feel of a professional military wargame.\n\nThe feel and flow of the game is purely outstanding. It does just about everything right compared to the competition and the realism and flow of combat is so nicely done real life battalion tactics simply work out of the box, without requiring a second thought on game-mechanics.\n\nIf you enjoy titles like Combat Mission, Close Combat etc this is a must have.

I was impressed to see the devs promptly roll out updates addressing bugs and decided to buy the game.\n\nI noticed that if you issue a group order to attack, the entire group will wait for everyone to get in line before advancing. This is all fine and dandy, except sometimes one unit will get itself stuck in a ditch, and stubbornly refuse to unf*ck itself. I guess manually having to reverse a vehicle out of the ditch and telling the dumbass driver to go around via waypoints is part of the realism experience.\n\nOn a serious note, persevere past the learning curve and you will find a hidden gem of a game.

Operation Star has some fantastic campaigns, winter maps, desert maps, 1970's conflict, 1980's conflict many thousands of hours of gameplay extended by battle editor.\n\nFrom what I have seen Mius Front will, when it's had time to mature, undergone a little bug fixing, enjoyed some tweaks, gets some new DLC Operations with new terrains, new armies and new conflicts, and recieves the constant love and support like the previous game, the devs never stopping to improve and refine their baby, when all that happens this will surely become the new Best battlefield simulation on Earth.\n","March 8","true","59.9"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I have all of the previous ones. I was very excited about this game because it's been in development for so long and promised so many new and wonderful things.\n\nI'm dissappointed.\n\nThis is basically a map pack. And not a very good one at that. They dressed up the UI a bit and tweaked a few things, but really, if you've played the others, you've played this one.\n\nThe Maps: Large stretches of land that are mostly flat with some rolling hills. The towns are just different arrangements of the same towns you saw in the previous games. There's not much strategy involved with such bland maps. If you have AT guns just pick a hill and they'll pick off the piecemeal attacks the AI sends your way.\n\nThe Graphics: I guess they were upgraded, but I don't see it. It's that weird kind of upgrade that some games try that actually makes things look worse.\n\nThe AI: I'd love to see some sort of fight being put up, but haven't yet. It's a drizzle of a tank or two, a squad or two, but nothing challenging. Not like the mass human waves you saw in Shilovo. It's like the enemy is content just probing, continuously.\n\nThe Environment: Please for the love of God give me the winter back. I have no idea what environment they were trying to create here. It's dark and gloomy with the sun shining in the background. It's dingy brown with fresh spring grass growing. It's confused.\n\nThe Campaign: Make a flat boring map, a generic arrangment of houses and dirt roads, and add in three times as many units for both sides. Voila! You have Mius Front.\n\nThe Bugs: Still there from the previous games. See a tank, see a tank disappear, see a tank appear, see a tank disappear. Hit a tank, wait ten seconds, hear tank get hit, wait ten seconds, see tank lose track. Fun.\n\nPlay the older games, this is garbage.\n\n\nPeace.","March 15","false","98.6"," 13 of 38 people (34%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","34","13","38","5","9"

Those are both great games but not the same genre, and I get that.\nBut if I've put a good 5 hours into playing tutorials and attempting to get a handle on the gameplay mechanics and still totally fail, well that's when I put the game down for a time, maybe forever.\n\nThe interface and user feedback is just a mess overall, and even when I found something I didn't understand and looked in the manual to try and figure it out, for example the command points system, there was a one sentance description that did nothing to clarify how it worked.\nA multititude of vague icons and colors will indicate status' on units, but there's no way inside the game to find out what they mean if you don't already know. Would it really be that hard to have some nice tooltips on things? Even when tooltips are present they are often unhelpful or even more confusing.\n\nAnd I dare someone to try and find uglier menu graphics in a game that otherwise looks this pretty. Or to try and understand the after action report screen. (5/200% of what??)\n\nThis is all aside from other things i've seen that could either be a bugs in the combat engine/AI or interface and readabilty issues:\nI've had tanks with no apparent damage, morale, or ammo issues, refuse to fire at enemy tanks a stone's throw away.\nInfantry carrying AT grenades run up to enemy armor then just stop and lay prone, or slowly crawl away, while the armor resolutely ignores them.\nHalftracks circling each other literally a couple feet apart, one unshooting, the other taking no damage whatsoever, for about 5-6 minutes.\nInfantry often seem to ignore heavy MG fire, and will jog straight up through an open field under heavy fire and murder the crew, with little or no damage.\n\nSome or all of these could be bugs or things I missed in the interface that the game was trying to tell me about, I just have no idea.\n\nGood complex games don't have to have bad interaces and tutorials. Crusader Kings 2 or Unity of Command are great examples of complicated games that are relatively easy to learn thanks to good tutorials, and give you all the needed information in game once you're there.\n\nIf you're really interested in this, at least watch a few long videos, or wait to see if they come out with some patches. I really hope they can improve things, because I can see the potential here, it's just not in a state I could recommened at the moment.\n\n","March 24","false","4.8"," 7 of 28 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","7","28","3","9"

This game is pretty impenetrable, and the tutorial is either broken or just infinitely too advanced for me.\n\nI assumed clicking "campaign" would be where you start. No, apparently "basic training" is in "quick battle." That makes sense, right? If your UI has more than 30 buttons and symbols, please accept the need for a tutorial to jump out at people.\n\nSo I start the tutorial. Move your camera, raise/lower it, turn it. All good. Now what? No 4th message appears. I see I have a unit, so I start messing around with it and looking at the buttons (which are all delayed tooltips). A couple of minutes into this, it finally pops up "move it here." After another 3 minutes of waiting, halfway into which I find the option to make time go faster (you right click the pause button, I think), my tank arrives. Next it shows other movement types and waypoints. As that's moving, it shows some other stuff, like the "halt order" button. Well, I try to click it. That's common to do in a tutorial, right? Use every function as it's shown to you? I mean, I want to find out of the halt is a full cancel, if it just pauses the action and you can unpause it, or what? Well, I can't tell you anything else. After that, any attempt to order a move again was met with "order not executed" in the top right. Can you select "order not executed" to be told why? Nope. Who'd need that in a tutorial?\n\nAll of this is that much more upsetting because it looks like a fun game - a /complicated/ fun game. But I had a much easier time getting into an ASCII roguelike. So it's a 22 minute refund - the first time I've used the function on steam.\n\nIt looks like a really good game, possibly the best thing available for what it is. But I don't want that specific thing that badly to spend many hours digging through the internet to learn how to play this game. If you've got some experience, or the patience, I'm sure you'll find it rewarding. But I can't, in good conscience, leave this game as consisting entirely of glowing positive reviews from veterans.

Unintuitive camera controls that are very difficult to smoothly and comfortable operate(You can't change the keybindings for the important functions either). In combination with unsmooth camera controls it performs very poorly, I'm on a I7-4790k, GTX 760 4gb with 32gb ram and I cannot get over 30 fps with various settings, except for the first 5-10 minutes of battle. If you look on youtube, there isn't a single video of this game with good performance either. The sound engine doesn't feel directional or realistic at all, you can barely tell where sounds are coming from. If you zoom all the way out, most things sound as if they were happening right next to you, not far away. The use of extremely complex symbols for tiles -that have no tooltips, text or any other way of finding their actual meaning. These are crucial because they tell the statistics of tiles to place your troops, you have to memorize them or you will not be able to play the game effectively, and they are not easy to memorize at all. As a comparison, I've memorized the entire nato counter symbology and that made much more sense and was much easier. The mode of the game where you are not in battle, but in the wargame-style tactical map was also pretty confusing, it has an excellent tutorial that covers all of the functions, color coding and symbols for that, but I still came to completely dislike the entire design and flow of the game. The UI is ♥♥♥♥ing huge, you have to scroll through pages or so of unit information that could easily be smaller and your entire army could fit on the screen. Instead, you can't even fit a whole company of your units in the order of battle because just the button that has the name of the company is  1/5 the size of your entire screen.\n\nHearts of Iron, War in the East, Advanced Tactics Gold, Men of War, Theatre of War, anything is better than this. In my opinion this game is a waste of money, it is unenjoyable and I doubt I will play it again. I'm not sure how this game got so many good reviews, but I at very least recommend getting Operation Star instead of Mius-Front. From the videos i've seen, the older one looks a bit better, but i've not played it.  Thanks for reading, I hope somebody finds this useful.","April 26","false","10.7"," 7 of 33 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","7","33","0","3"

Europe devs who don't really understand the concept of "hey lets not throw a million buttons and leave things uncomplicated"\nThe turorial is a nightmare and you often don't even understand why you lost in a tutorial\nYou rarely even understand what the overall objectives are and some things are absolute nonsense. I have played complicated games as they are my absolute favorite but this isn't "complicated" this is a button-tastic nightmare of confusing commands and silly overlays. The FPS drops are also extremely ridiculous as I can run ArmA 3 on Ultra in a city of 100 people and get 50 FPS but I get 26 FPS here in combat.\nOh and combat, lets go there. You don't tell your guys who to attack and you just make suggestions. For instance I have a PaK with a T-70 right in front of it. It could hit it perfectly and I designated that "Priority Target" The PaK gun crew laughed at me and continued firing at infantry.\nThe sounds of this game are also absolutely, extremely terrible and overall it isn't an enjoyable experience. It would be more fun with multiplayer as well but thats "coming later".\nYou spend 30-40$ and you expect a game that you can make sense of and enjoy, right? Well don't look here for that.\nAlso to the fanboys, yes I have played multiple extremely difficult games. No I won't go back to (insert pleb-tier game) because I am not from there.\nDevs, I don't know how you can fix it but if you do I will buy it again.","March 7","false","2.1"," 12 of 54 people (22%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","22","12","54","9","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/throggy/recommended/312980/","throggy","gamersglut","http://steamcommunity.com/id/throggy/","13 products in account","After playing this a few days, I have decided to thumbs down.\nThe reasons for the thumbs down:\nFalse advertising possibly.  Under system requirements on store page, "Storage: 5 GB available space ", yet download and installed space used was 1.1 GB.\nPoor FPS\nVery bad language barrier.\nVery incomplete manual and instructions on how the game works.\nThe forum is a joke due to said language barrier, and I will not even attempt to waste my time on there.\n\nIs the game worth $31.49 on sale? NO\n$20? NO\n$10? Maybe\n$5? Yep\n\nAfter I spent some time figuring out some of the how to play, I have found some aspects almost enjoyable. (Although ALL tracer rounds fly over ALL enemies and never hit a darn thing.) The AI path finding on vehicles seems terrible.\n\n\n\n","March 9","false","41.7"," 10 of 51 people (20%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","20","10","51","9","3"
