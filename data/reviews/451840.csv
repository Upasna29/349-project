"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSoupSox/recommended/451840/","MrSoupSox","Soupa Blyat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSoupSox/","341 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWatching gameplay of this title before my Vive came in, I was somewhat unimpressed by the simplistic graphics, and I thought it didn't look like all that compelling of a game.\n\nHoly crap I was wrong.\n\nOut of Ammo is incredibly intuitutive, challenging, fast-paced, and certainly a great showcase of what room-scale VR can really do, and I am incredibly excited to see what the dev team plans on adding in the future. One thing that certainly doesn't come across in videos is how the game places you in the world. In videos, it looks like the ground (when controlling units from above) is roughly at knee level, but in-game, the ground is actually closer to waist level, and I wish I could explain how immersive this makes controlling your units.\n\nAnother amazing utilization of VR controls that the game utilizes is in the reloading and grenade-throwing; incredibly intuitive, accurate, and satisfying every time you do it. Also a lot of room for personal mastery of the mechanics; after practicing the sniper rifle a lot, I have a good feel for where it's pointing without aiming down the scope, and the potential for efficient, practiced cocking of the rifle makes it feel very powerful in your hands.\n\nThe one gameplay aspect I would love to see added is soldier progression, and the devs themselves have expressed plans for adding this in the close future (soldier levelling based on enemies killed, or something along those lines). Another feature I am excited for (which again, the devs have plans for adding in the more distant future) is co-op play. It's my understanding that the prototypes for this multiplayer component are in very very early alpha stages, so I'm unsure if it would involve online, local, or both sorts of multiplayer gamelay, but either way, I am excited and intrigued by the possibility.\n\nBesides all the actual gameplay aspects that I enjoy, the communication from the dev team has been absolutely fantastic. Not only have they rolled out at least one major update per week for the past 6 weeks (as long as I've owned the game), but every time, they include the full patch notes, current recognized bugs or issues, and goals for the next patch or hotfix (which usually is posted < 24 hrs after a major patch, and typically resolves most of the recognized bugs). I don't often see this level of communication from devs to players in non-VR games, not to mention the brand new VR game space, and it is extremely refreshing to see a team that not only details it's goals to players via patch notes, but also goes out of their way to respond to player's concerns directly on the Steam discussion forums. Couldn't be more impressed with how the team responds and deals with player feedback.\n\nFor 15$, if you own a Vive, this is a must-buy in my opinion.\n\nEDIT:\n\nDeleted several immature replies regarding Dean Hall's influence in this game, after his experience with DayZ. The fact of the matter is that this game, for me, is already worth 15$. If you don't think an Early Access game is worth it at the time of you buying it, you should probably wait until it has what you're looking for. This game has received significant patches every week since I bought it, and has only further validated my 15$ purchase. Seriously, for 15$, this game is a freaking steal. It's my second most-played VR game behind Audioshield, which I bought for 25$ (and hasn't received a patch in over a month, unlike this game).","April 20","true","11.5"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","31","41","0","0"

This team hasn't just dropped the game on us and disappeared, they've been working their @sses off to refine it and add content.\n\nThis is a very good example of early access done right.\n\n_________________________________________________________\n\nIf you own an HTC Vive, this is a great title to own. It's a lot of fun with its core mechanics in place, aiming, shooting, placing defences\n\nI would say, the only thing it lacks right now is some form of progression. You can jump into different locations and start telling troops where to station themselves, where to setup defences, and then you can jump into any one of them and start shooting baddies.\n\nIf there were progression, new weapons to buy, new troop types to buy, money to be gained, of course. New defenses, upgrades, etc, that would be awesome.\n\nI've always enjoyed games that allow you to eventially become superpowered, and this would be the perfect kind of experience.\n\nAll the same, as it is, it's a great VR experience, I found myself ducking out of fire, and handling bad guys like a pro. Hopefully the devs keep up the amazing work and add more content to this already very polished experience.","May 9","true","0.4"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","25","31","0","0"

This seems to be an honest example of Early Access being useful.  Early Vive users get to play it and have some fun, and the devs (who do seem to be actively listening and responding to feedback) get some free beta testing and balance trial and error.  It's super fun so far, and scratches a tower defense itch well if you have it.

It's tons of fun and works really well with the strategy/action back and forth.  Things get a bit hectic quickly - and I often find myself wishing I could play the first person bit for longer.  I wouldn't say this is a con per se, probably more on my lack of strategy.  I imagine the developer will allow for easier/harder settings to assist the people that suck at games (me.)  Graphics are simple yet fun, and wow do I love throwing the people around the strategy map - please always leave this feature.  Maybe even allow the user to throw these people into enemies?

If you get the balancing right, this will turn in amazing game. Right now, the HQ is a too overpowered as when I was about 30 minutes in (wave 100ish), the artillery was still able to clean up the entire wave. Another thing I noticed (but this might be harder to balance for) is that placement of items heavily relied on the amount of space I could walk around in. It might be useful to have some sort of teleportation feature so I can roam the map and expand where I place turrets (along the lines of Age of Empires where I want to grow my base).\n\nOverall, great work and cannot wait for more!","April 17","true","25.8"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","26","45","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnterUserID/recommended/451840/","EnterUserID","Enter User ID","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EnterUserID/","585 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nOut of Ammo is a wonderfully underrated VR game and hidden gem. It scratches my RTS itch while at the same time letting me join the fray by taking control of individual units to help out.\n\nThe maps are varied, and they just added a few new alpha maps. I love the d-day map because it is a little more titled in the player’s favor (but it still ends up in tragedy once you get up to wave 45+). The other maps are harder to properly defend (until you start to get the hang of it- even still, it’s a little tough) because you have to defend all around you (as where the new d-day map you primarily have to worry about the hill enemies all funnel into (Snipers do spawn on the mountains behind you and an occasional enemy zerg will come from the sides or behind you- but very rarely).\n\nMy favorite part of the game is the active reloading per unit. Every time you reload it’s like a fun mini-game. With a solider you have an m16 and have to take out your empty clip, reach down, and slam a new one in. Snipers have bolt action rifles which require you to fire your shot, pull back the lever, reach down to get a new bullet, place it in the gun, then push the lever in. Rocket guys have RPG’s- similar mechanics to the M16 except after you fire you reach down for a new rocket, medics have pistols and engines have pump action shotguns. But the most fun, in my opinion, is when you are in the heavy machine gun nest and you are firing that bad boy. You can watch the belt of ammo run out- and once it does, you have to push these handles back, lift up the top of the machine gun, reach down to the ammo box and grab another belt of ammo, slap it into the machine gun, close the lid, then pull the levers towards you, then you can engage the enemy.\n\nSometimes, with any of these reloading “mini-games” they tend to bug out. When you reach down sometimes to reload the M16 or sniper, you won’t bring back up ammo, so you have to do it a few times (although I’ve been getting the hang of it and it seems like after the latest update it’s not as big of a deal).\n\nMy biggest grip with the game is I wish they would let you have more units and structures. The enemy forces can get insane in the later waves and they will zerg which will eventually overpower your forces because after awhile, if you max all units and structures- the helicopter that resupplies you between waves still comes- but will just land and leave, leaving nothing behind.\n\nBut there aren’t really that big of a deal- the rest of the game really shines over the imperfections- and with the game in such an early state, I am confident it will only get better- considering the game as it stands is the most fun I have had in VR.\n","May 16","true","3.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Even though it's in early-access it's still rather challenging, it runs perfectly and has a decent variety of maps. It can be quite difficult to manage all of your troops, as well as build new defenses and defend the base from all angles - but i'm sure it will become more fluid as time goes on.

It's like they took the best parts of Final Approach but in a genre that I like a lot more (tower defense/strategy).  Hopefully they keep updating the game, fixing bugs and balance etc.  What would REALLY make the game a killer app is if there were about 200-300 waves and they scaled a lot better, so that each wave was definitely slightly harder than the one before it so that basically no one ever reached the highest level.  Then you could have a global and local scoreboard and compete with both your friends locally and everyone else globally.  Make it so that if you are decent you can get to level 30-50, good 100, great 150 and 200 is perfect.","April 22","true","4.8"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lazer32/recommended/451840/","Lazer32","Lazer32","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lazer32/","328 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSimple base defense game with lots of fun mechanics!  Set up your bases defenses (Guard towers, sandbag emplacements, bunkers, and machine gun nests).  Currently you can only get a small number of defenses at once but hopefully they can scale it out a bit and add some more variety down the road.  One of the coolest things about this game is you can take direct control of your soldiers.  Each soldier has a different type of weapon and with each weapon comes different firing modes and reload mechanics.  Yes, you have to physically reload your weapons which I think will become a must have for any VR first person shooter moving forward.  With the rifle you have to take out the mag and slap a new one back in.  There is a pump action shotgun on one of the engineers that is tons of fun.  Keep that left trigger button held in to grip the pump action and fire / pump away to your hearts content.  Overall, I'm having a blast with this game.  I cannot wait until they add more content.  I'm really hoping they expand the maps a bit to allow for more base structures and I'm really hoping they eventually add vehicles.  Anyway, I better sum this up before I start turning this review into a wishlist!\n\nPros:\n*Great VR implementation of a base defense game.  Try to survive as long as you can against the terrorist hordes!\n*Weapon mechanics are great, have to physically reload them which ends up making a whole lot of sense in VR and is actually quite fun to do.  Really makes you feel like you are handling a real weapon!\n\nCons:\n*No coop :(\n*Limited variety ATM but lots of potential to expand\n*While there are multiple maps many of them feel like they play about the same.  Base layouts don't change much between them","April 30","true","2.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It works in Standing mode and in Room-scale (though room-scale obviously better).\n\nMy favourite part is how you go from an RTS overview down to possessing your soldiers to control them directly in FPS mode, with gun in your right hand and different reload-actions based on the gun, and grenades to throw  in your left, and walls to duck behind. I think it's a clever way to have a war game in VR. It lets you jump from action to action in a so simple way, and completely negating the huge problem of motion sickness. You can be anywhere on the battlefield and you don't have to do uncomfortable locomotion. In my opinion, that's really clever. Probably the smartest solution to get around in a VR game that I've seen so far. It's so smart I actually had to write this to realize.. this game doesn't have motion sickness problems. It's just "put your gear on and have an evening of fun". Most VR games I've tried so far is just some novelty experiment thing, but this feels like an actual game.\n\nI hope some other larger titles will be made with the same design principles (though maybe more mature and elaborate graphics..)\n\n\nThe down side to the game currently is that right now there's just a wave defense mode. They will expand later, but right now that's all you do on 5 different maps (more maps to come), and everything feels maybe a bit too simple.

Also, sometimes the game starts you off with swapped hands, not a big deal but kind of annoying.","May 7","true","12.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Graphics aren't the best, but the game really impresses by game design and gameplay. I really like how there are so many different weapon types (rifle. shotgun, machine gun turret, grenade, pistol, sniper, rocket launcher, etc). All of them feel different to use. For example, you feed belts of ammo into the machine gun but individually load and ♥♥♥♥ sniper rounds. Be careful, it's easy to hit your controllers together when pumping the shotgun.\n\nFights can get frantic. One time I found myself laying behind cover, chucking nades and blind firing hoping to survive a huge wave. There are currently three HQ abilities. It reminds me of Company of Heroes where you could fire off map artillery and call strafing runs from airborne. Newest patch added iron sights on guns. If I would add something, it'd be new enemy types like helicopters to shoot down or more units. At it's current state, I solidly recommend this game if you have a Vive.","April 26","true","3.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Even as it stands it is by far worth the money asked. I was a little leary about purchasing but I'm very glad I did. Other than Space Pirate Trainer this has to be the most fun I've had in VR, maybe even more fun than SPT. I'm just glad it's in early access because I'm REALLY looking forward to the new features that are planned and I hope to see a lot more mission based play and maybe get away from the tower defense mode that it is now - not that that's a bad thing, but would really like more depth. Taking control of your soldiers is crazy fun. The reloading mechanics of most of the weapos is GREAT! Although I wish the pistol wasn't some kind of uber weapon that never ran out of ammo. Anyway, if you're timid about hitting that purchase button, don't be, it really is a great grame.

The more I played, the more things I found to do. Can't wait until it's completely finished. Highly recommended to anyone else who is tired of the medicore VR shooters currently out there.\n\nI'll leave some notes here for whatever they're worth:\nThe sniper rifle is great to use, but it's much easier to just use it without the scope. It'd be nice if the scope actually zoomed in, but I'm guessing it'd need to render parts of the scene twice for that. Otherwise, it'd be good if there was some incentive to use the scope.\nOn the 2nd level I was 44 waves in when an enemy unit was shooting me from within my own HQ and I had no way to attack him (I realise it's still early access, just pointing it out)\nI didn't realise I could command people who weren't in structures, I only found out by accident, somehow I ended up using one of the soldiers who was just standing there and I could fire his pistol\nIf I had to make a few suggestions (without knowing how hard they'd be to implement):\nAs I was playing it, I was thinking how great it'd be if one of the HQ powers was to be able to man a mini-gun on the side of a helicopter as it circled the area for a few seconds :)\nBeing able to place claymores or tripwire mines would be fun\nA mode of play with some feeling of progression would be very welcome. I assume waves go on forever at the moment?\nAgain though, the game feels great.","April 15","true","4.7"," 35 of 65 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","35","65","2","10"

Here's the thing about it though, it gets "nintendo hard" near the end, with enemies coming in so absolutely fast that it's literally impossible to beat them.  That's how you get high scores in this game right now.  What I'd prefer in this kinda game would be at least the option for another mode, where you still face endless waves of mobs, but the difficulty is wayyyyy reduced and you're scored on difficulty x "time you can stay alive" at that difficulty.  Something like that.  I would have fun playing this game for hours if you could actually play this game for hours without constantly knowing that certain, unbeatable death, was coming in right about at 15m.  Otherwise extremely solid concept though.  I can see a lot of games using this kinda setup for things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/akiyamamio/recommended/451840/","akiyamamio","Raymoo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/akiyamamio/","92 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt's a base defense game with a neat little bit of strategy.  You place buildings and assign 3 different types of troops to them to defend your base.  You can use points you earn to call in airstrikes, strafing runs, and sniper shots.  The unit posession is what really makes the game though.  For a certain number of shots, you can play your unit in first person, having to duck behind cover and reload and throw grenades.  My favorite is the machine gunner, where you hold the grip button on each controller and aim that way.  In the overview, you're basically a giant, but the "floor" is waist height so you don't have to kill your legs or back reaching down everywhere.\n\nThere's not a whole lot of complexity once you've figured out the basics, and you end up shoving yourself into your solider's heads more and more as the waves progress since your units have a tendency to be oblivious to enemies who aren't within their range, which gets a little ridiculous when you have a clear firing line for several hundred meters and yourt rifleman waits until all 20 of the guys start firing at him before he fires back, but it's part of the game management I guess.\n\nI don't regret the price I paid for it one bit, and I've only played an hour at this point.","April 28","true","3.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

If you think that means I shouldn't care if it has bugs or isn't worth the asking price, feel free to stop reading.\n\nOut of Ammo is an interesting concept, but the core gameplay ends up being fairly dull, and the game includes some design flaws that make me concerned that the developer is headed in the wrong direction. As it stands now I don't think this title is worth the asking price, and I do not feel confident that the developer will fix up the title enough for it to be worth the price in the future.\n\nThe graphics aren't very good, which is obvious from the screenshots and doesn't need to be mentioned much.\n\nCore gameplay is honestly pretty dull. You can toggle between basic tower-defense style construction, and controlling your soldiers for FPS gameplay. The FPS mechanics are very lackluster; you can stand in place and fire weightless assault rifles and sniper rifles at Lego people that slide around the landscape and shoot back at you. You hold your weapons one-handed and reload with your other hand; firing rifles one-handed feels weird and I wish they had implemented a mechanic where you had to hold the barrel with your other hand. To make matters worse, you don't "hold" the guns at the correct angle. In any other VR game, if you're holding a pistol, the pistol is oriented such that the controller behaves as the grip. In Out of Ammo you aim the controller like a laser pointer, which feels completely unnatural and further ruins the FPS experience. I can't understand why any developer would publicly release a game with such an obvious design flaw, even in Early Access.\n\nThe TD portions have poorly designed controls and are unintuitive. You receive supply crates designed to construct defensive points like sandbags and towers. You grab these crates and position them, which doesn't sound too bad but is somehwat clunky in practice. You can click on defensive points to assign soldiers to them, or click on soldiers to "possess" them and enter the aforementioned FPS mode. When you click on something, a floating menu appears over it. For some reason the floating menu scales and rotates as you move your head, which is disorienting and nauseating. Every other VR title leaves menus floating in a fixed position in 3D space. I don't know why the developers for Out of Ammo went out of their way for a system that is worse.\n\nSince the gameplay is very unintuitive, there is a long narrated tutorial. The tutorial is buggy, with some lines of instruction getting cut off. At one point, after the narrator tells you how to reload, there is literally 30 full seconds of the narrator breathing and shuffling some things on his desk before the narration continues. I wasn't able to complete the tutorial because I reached a point where the narrator was telling me to position the rest of my emplacements and soldiers, but I didn't actually have any emplacements or soldiers left to position.\n\nThe developers didn't implement any functionality for the Vive's app-menu button and AFAIK there is no way to quit a level without quitting the game. Another random complaint - the sniper rifle has no zoom.\n\nI know a lot of people who haven't tried VR get the impression that all of the games are boring, but most of the VR games I've tried have been extremely immersive and loads of fun. This game is neither immersive or fun. It is clunky and boring. I understand it is in Early Access right now, but I just can't imagine it improving enough to be worth $15. Furthermore, the developers have expressed that they will never reduce the price or put the game on sale for any reason. I cannot recommend this title. There are much better VR games for your money.","April 17","false","0.4"," 62 of 119 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","62","119","0","17"

At first it's very simple, but the oncoming waves shortly become overwhelming, the learning curve for each map is a few tries and you're good to go. There are a few little bugs [as of writing this in 0.7.1] but none of them impact the actual gameplay, ie; few enemies getting stuck out of bounds, controllers swapped, minor things. Everytime you play the waves are different everytime and can come from any direction. You can also control each soldier individually and it makes the game crazy intense. There's also nice amounts of detail that I didn't notice in other games. If you are controlling a soldier you can actual hear your "clothes and gear" rubbing against eachother when you move your hands, head, and body, almost feels like I'm wearing an outfit and down there bullets flying everywhere.\nSupport this game and their devs!

I wasn't expecting it to be so engaging given the simple graphics, but it quickly dispelled any fears I had. I will point out some things that I think should be changed/added to the game to make it better though, since this is still early access.\n\n- Add something above the enemy's head to better indicate who the enemy is. I had a couple scenarios where the enemy invaded and I couldn't tell between them and my men immediately, which cost me. There could be a hardcore mode that didn't include the indicators as well.\n- Perhaps add in a way to use your left hand to grip the barrel of the gun. I was instinctively placing my left hand under the barrel anyways, because it just feels cooler to do so.\n- Add in a way to move while in first person mode. If I could command the soldier I'm playing as to move while using them that would be pretty cool, even if it was just by pointing at a spot on the ground.\n- Maybe add some sort of objective other than survival. While this is a really cool game as is, I can see a point in the future where I'm exiting the game before I lose just because I've gone too long without really meeting any objectives.","May 18","true","3.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm really glad that I did. This is a top-down tower defense game where you can controll individual units for a period of time. It feels kinda similar to final approach, though it is obviously a very different game. Each unit type behaves differenty and has different mechanics for reloading. They all feel really good, and would be fun enough if that was all that you could do, but there is also the commander mode for lack of a better term. In this (default) mode you place down structures and then order units to man the structures, you can also call down artilllery or a strafing run.\n\nThis is definitely an early access game, and there isn't much here yet. So far, there is a tutorial and 5 different maps that you can play on with endless waves. Honestly though, even if nothing else gets added I feel like I will get my money's worth.

If you're going to be a salty salty saltbag about that fact, then please downvote this review for bonus salt. However, if you're open to good games offering quality fun-times, regardless of where they're coming from, then this is the review for you!\n\nIn short, the game is awesome. Even if there was no further development on it and it stayed like this permanently, I'd still recommend you buy it. It's just that fun.\n\nThe combination of RTS and shooter is well executed, and the transition between the two modes is easy and smooth. Placing the defences and assigning units is intuitive. The wave structure of enemies is good, sometimes being delivered by trucks, or descending from the hills or from city side streets.\n\nWhen possessing units, each weapon type has its own mechanics, such as bolt-action snipers, mounted machine guns requiring both hands, etc.\n\nThe difficulty is pretty good - it starts out just easy enough to let a beginner find their feet, and ramping up gradually to a full-blown clusterf&$%. You have to defend your HQ building, and when it is destroyed - Game Over, buddy. So don't get to focused on possessing your favourite unit because excrement could be hitting the proverbial fan over on the other side of your base.\n\nWhile your HQ is still functioning, you can spend points you earn in combat on special abilities like artillery strikes, strafe runs (which are really really useful later on!) and a precision sniper shot (which feels less useful than possessing a sniper unit and taking the shot manually, but I digress). You can also assign your medics to retrieve and treat enemy combatants for extra points you can spend on murdering other enemy combatants! Delicious irony.\n\nThere's no campaign mode yet, just a (pretty good) tutorial and Freeplay mode with 4 maps (Forest, Desert, City, and Night-time Tundra). I like desert, where I can really get my long distance snipe on!\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nIs it worth buying?\nYes.\nWill it get better?\nProbably.\nIs it still worth it even if it doesn't get better?\nYes.\nWhat about your opinions on Dean Hall?\nIrrelevant.","April 17","true","9.2"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","52","26","50","6","0"

This game is awesome! Seriously, they need to re-shoot their demo videos for this game. I didn't buy this game THREE TIMES because I thought the demo videos looked super crappy. They're just bad videos! The gameplay is amazing.\n\nI LOVE strategy games, so this is hands down my new favorite HTC Vive game. I think I may have gotten the #1 high score on the first level I played (after like the 10th try). I can't wait to play the other levels.\n\nIt feels a bit like you're playing a table top warhammer game or something when you're in strategy mode (god's eye view). You can bend down and get on eye level with the little characters. The helicopter coming in is just really cool too. I kept trying to catch it.\n\nHowever, what really sets this game apart for me is how I can take control of a character and just mow down the horde in FPS mode, or snipe from a tower. There's some skill involved, but it's more casual. Sniping anywhere on the body is a one shot kill, for example.\n\nI'm just really really pumped about this game after an hour or so playing it.

Keeps me coming back over and over. Really a must-buy if you can snag one of these headsets.\nThink of it as playing with plastic army men. In the commander perspective you set up your base, assign your troops and can call in support. You can also pop into troops to shoot and toss grenades. It all works very well and is perhaps one of the best workarounds to the whole problem of VR locomotion I've seen. The mechanics for shooting are also super satisfying. Shooting and tossing grenades in VR while dodging bullets is a blast.\nThe only real draw back to the game can be chalked up to the early access status. The AI is pretty lame, enemies walk in a straight line toward you and there's not a whole lot of variation. But the updates have been good and it appears the dev is interested in broadening it a bit.\nAlso it'd be good if there were some kind of high score or leaderboard thing to get a sense of progress as you continue to play (as I have).","May 4","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The idea is that you build up defenses around your base, assign soldiers to man those defenses and when there's a problem, take over any of those soldiers in first person and blow away the attackers. The sniper role especially in a tower is really awesome to play.\n\nThere's still some glitches and early access issues, as well as balance stuff to fix (the ai of your soldiers is not great), but even at this early stage the game is really great for VR and just fun overall.

For an early access title it is already very fun. The better you get the more enjoyment you get out of it as well. I think it is priced appropriately, assuming the devs keep updating it.\n\nCouple of notes:\n- This game is a bit of a system hog. Despite the simplistic graphics, this is one of the few games that my setup struggles with to keep a good framerate (R9 390X, 6600K, 16GB RAM). Might be good if the devs looked at optimisation.\n- The rocket launcher guy is pretty OP as it stands. Reload times are long, but with 2-3 of them in towers you pretty much go straight to wave 55+ no issue. It's trivially easy to wipe out a whole wave by possessing one rocket dude.\n- Really can't wait for updates!! :)","April 16","true","2.9"," 17 of 36 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","17","36","0","0"

I spoke too soon... they ♥♥♥♥ing ruined the game AGAIN...\nJESUS MAN... Don't change WHAT IS ALREADY WORKING... I WAS\nreally enjoying the game, now it's ruined.\n\n~ Tanks have sniper accurary, can shoot from 10 miles away and\ndestroy everything now.

I love the "art" it looks like minecraft, which is cool.\n\nBUT... The game is incredibly frustrating, here is my list as to why.\n\n1 - GAME GETS WAY TOO HARD too fast.\n2 - You DON'T get the same items in order, SO YOU COULD STRATEGIZE,\nimagine playing chess and the pieces are always in different spots when\nyou are beginning, it doesn't work.\n3 - WHAT THE HELL am I going to do with 5 SNIPERS and 1 Rifleman.\n4 - Why do I ONLY get 1 RPG guy? I don't think I've ever gotten more than\none RPG guy in all the time I've played. If he dies you are screwed.\n5 - The RPG rockets don't have a long blash area, almost at all, sometimes\nit does, and sometimes it doesn't seem to have a decent blast radious.\n6 - CANNOT turn the MUSIC OFF while playing.\n7 - The enemy can get heavy artillery (tanks), and you don't.\n8 - Snipers are VERY FAR at times, and if you try to kill them WITHOUT using\nthe "special power" the sniper rifle shakes like nobody's business.\n9 - YOU CANNOT PAUSE THE GAME... not even to scratch your face, are\nyou serious?\n10 -  The mounted machine gun doesn't seem to work, I haven't been able\nto do the "two hand thing".\n11 - SNIPERS cannot operate the mounted machine gun, why? Only riflemen.\n12 - You get attacked from literally every angle (This could be a taste thing,\nCould they make a level where you are only attacked from the front?\nat least at a 180 degrees or such? I should make the game more enjoyable.\n13 - Your soldiers are replaced RANDOMLY, WHY?!?!? Why couldn't receive\n2 or 3 at a time. If they die you are pretty much out of luck, unless you\nget few, which you never know.\n14 - Sometimes the helicopter comes and brings LIKE NOTHING... only one\nmedic tent or some crappy thing.\n\n\nThe glitches are OK, not even worried about that, I just think that the\nmechanics are not going to get fixed. NOT BEING ABLE TO CHOOSE\nSOME OF THE ITEMS BEFORE YOU START makes is really frustrating.\n\nIt's the equivalent of Playing MAGIC and not getting any mana, so you\nget stuck.

I was expecting at least a little more strategy and base building, but instead it's more of a tower defense game that delivers a few predetermined buildings to you every once and a while. Managing and positioning your people is somewhat difficult because they seem to be rather stupid if you're not controlling them and just die constantly, leading you to repopulate their posts. The highlight of the game is when you take over a soldier and get to use the gun mechanics, where actions like reloading and tossing grenades are made satisfyingly physical, but the actual commander part of the game just isn't all that fun right now. It is in early access, and if it improves I'll buy it again at a later date, but for now I played it for 18 minutes and pretty much got my fill of what it had to offer and didn't feel like I was ever going to launch it again.","April 29","false","0.3"," 7 of 20 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","7","20","0","3"

Out of Ammo is a fantastic strategy FPS game. One point you're moving around troops and putting up defenses. The next, you turn into the soldier you just placed down shooting at the enemies. The controls are easy to grasp. The gameplay is fun and intense. My only problem with the game is there is no progression system. I think putting in a leveling system would be a really  good addition. The gameplay is awesome, but it's hard for me to keep coming back without having a feeling of progression.
