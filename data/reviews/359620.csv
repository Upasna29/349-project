I remember being amazed by the game's OST (soundtrack) and characters.\n\nI still love this game to this day.\n\nThe storyline and character development are very deep. This purchase is worth more than steam is charging for it.","November 4, 2015","true","2.3"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","35","45","5","6"

After playing Shadow of the Comet (I loved it! Read my review! http://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/recommended/389470), I was looking forward to playing this. After ten minutes, my hopes were diminished, and after an hour, my hopes were dashed and by the end, I was a very very confused gamer.\nPrisoner of Ice went backwards in terms of so many things. Trying to blend 3dish/claymation looking characters in 2-D settings just doesn't work. The setting is right before WWII, and as far as Lovecraft goes, thats a little too modern for my taste. The story is an absolute mess, trying to loosely branch off of The Mountains of Madness, and serve as a kind of continuation of Shadow of the Comet.....within 3-4 hours (Steam says 6 hours, but I had long periods of being AFK). Thats right. Short. It's so short, there is no time to care about really any of the characters, and those we do know from Shadow of the Comet, it feels like they threw them in so we could kinda care about somebody! Maybe if they had made this game longer, they could have developed the story a lot better, but they didn't and we are now stuck with this. I honestly couldn't even really explain to you the plot. I had to go to Wikipedia just to find out what in the world I just played. For those who know my reviews and what I play, that should definitely tell you something. Pixel hunting is back!...and man is it annoying. Shadow of the Comet threw pixel hunting out the window, and the graphics were all pixelated. Now in this mixed mess of a game, good luck finding the key you need in a timed puzzle. Oh yes, this game is full of timed puzzles. However, if you do die (you will), the game does autosave so you have a chance to quickly figure out what in the world to do.\nNow, does this game do anything right? Actually it does. The cut scenes are actually pretty great. The music also sets the tone pretty well. Aaaaaand........thats it.\nShadow of the Comet is the superior game. Period. The only reason I can see anyone enjoying this game is if one is playing with nostalgia glasses. Otherwise, this game can be missed.\n\nNote: The review feels more like a rant than a review, but I had such high hopes.","February 12","false","5.6"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","4"

Easily!\n\nThe game is loosely based on the Cthulhu mythos in the world of H.P. Lovecraft, though readers familiar with that universe will know that even in most Cthulhu stories the octopus god doesn't show up much.  But, still, this game has some twists and turns the way you might expect from a Lovecraft story.\n\nJourney back to 20 years ago in computer-game development, the days when MSDOS still ruled and many people were trying out Windows 95 for the first time.  Sure, the graphics are dated -- but at the same time they're kinda cool!  Isn't that why all of these retro-style games are in vogue now?\n\nLike many games from the time, I can't say much about the music or the voices other than I found it helpful just to turn them off.  Luckily, this was one of the games at the time that allowed you to have subtitles along with spoken word.\n\nHowever, also like many games of the time -- this game actually has a well-written plot and is accompanied with some detailed storytelling.  In other words, this game is from a time when graphics and sound weren't that good and so developers had to actually design a COMPLETE game in order to it to be considered good.\n\nOf course, one of the drawbacks is the point-and-click interface.  And, yes, this game reminded me of why I found these types of games so frustrating as sometimes you engage in the battle for pixel spotting.  The puzzles aren't that difficult, especially considering that you can interact with (i.e. take into your inventory) very few objects.\n\nWell worth the price I paid for it, and a great use of time and an afternoon of distraction.  Don't miss out!","January 2","true","2.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Lovecraft. If you enjoy pixel-hunting and illogical puzzles, give it a go.\n\n"The Freeze-and-Destroy" - give me a break!","January 2","false","3.5"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","21","4","19","0","0"
