Unfortunately, yes there a ton of issues which are making it feel hardly worth 20$ even. They give you a warning that says it's early access and to expect some issues, but there's more than "some" if you will. I'll break down some basic pros and cons (I have not played RCT3, my last was RCT2 if that helps judge any of you guys looking to possibly jump back into this franchise.)\n\nPros:\n- You still get to make a theme park and make rollercoasters.\n- Menus seem pretty clean and pretty easily navigated.\n- Some of the customizable options for paths and such are cool.\n- Probably couldn't be stated enough, the spline with coasters has so much potential and upside if it works, but still seems a bit too frustrating at the moment.\n- UGC could make this insanely awesome once implemented.\n\nCons: (Yes, there's quite a lot, but it's just things I honestly think they could improve on and make this game much much better.)\n\n- Lag... This is arguably one of the most frustrating issues noted. Switching around in the menus seems to just not sit right at all with the game. There's so many points in the game that lag becomes an issue that as much as I'm trying to ACTUALLY play the game with a positive outlook, I physically can't...\n\n- Very minimal customization options. (Mostly scenery things, but a few others)\n\n- Path creation is quite annoying, putting a stand or booth down or whatever non-ride hut you put down.. if it doesn't form a line you should have the option to automatically have it connect to the path at the easiest and shortest route. Creating a super small path 1 inch away from the building and not being able to connect it gets very frustrating. (I'm sure they already know this.)\n\n- Coaster creation again. I can't even make a basic loop on a coaster anymore. Some of the prebuilt pieces offer some neat designs/ideas but they ultimately feel kind of lame. I figured they'd have an option to add a "loop" and then you can choose the metrics on it.. but you have to do some funky spline work that right when you think it looks good and you budge just a hair, the whole piece you just spent messing with is all messed up. Adding a straight track with spline feels ridiculously hard when it shouldn't be.. They need to have some snap options or something to help the building process of coasters. Simplicity honestly goes so far if it works (which I know it has in previous games). Honestly, I could explain so much more.. but I'm just assuming they're working on trying to fix the relatively poor custom coaster design process. Such a good concept so poorly executed. :(\n\n- Pre-made coasters feel half-♥♥♥♥♥, and that's being generous..... Not even going to get into that.\n\n- Not sure the bigger park staff huts works any better. (I could just be confused one how it works..?) I had a small mechanic hut near some rides with 1 employee, switched it to 3 and it felt HARDLY any better to fixing the rides. I finally get to the bigger mechanic building, employee 10, and I literally feel like it's producing 0 work. It'll have like 1 ride repaired when 5+ are broken down right next to it. Not sure again if I'm dumb or if that's just not working. Eventually rides get fixed, but it takes much longer than I think it's supposed to be.\n\n- Campaign has some very bad issues. If you want someone who hasn't played your game before to really get into it, you have to give some better direction and descriptions. ie... you don't get all coaster style options right away, you should be able to highlight over the items you don't have and it tells you how to obtain them. One of the biggest issues, though, is the freezing/"GG games over" pretty much after you get so far. My buddy and I both bought 2 expansions of land to our parks and that seems to be the sweet spot that you have permanent game issues. His saved game in campaign no longer loads, and mine takes about 3-4 minutes to load my park and then another 2-3 to become functional as the screen is froze trying to load it. (I have a very good computer and internet connection, as does he). Once I finally get in, it's just consant issues, to the point I can't play the game.\n\n- Deleting is a nightmare. If you ever get that feeling in your stomach trying to do something super simple but it's beyond frustrating... prepare to get that feeling.. a lot. You give the delete a bulldozer emblem... make it a bulldozer, let us just cruise over those trees and bushes with ease... Obviously we want confirmations on deleting our rides and such.. but don't make it take 40 minutes trying to clear some land.\n\n- I actually tried the music for some of the rides. C'mon...\n\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR review, should you buy?\n\nI want to say yes.. buy, but I don't feel comfortable doing that. The game has SO much potential.. it's 2016, right? It has a lot of issues, and if they're open to ACTUALLY reading reviews, I think they can knock this game out of the park.\n\nUnfortunately, everyone knows a game is defined by it's launch (sad but true). And this one failed pretty hard. It's labeled early access, but I've played much less developed games in early access that ran better.\n\nBUT!!!! Don't give up on this game. Give them some time, enjoy older RCT games. Companies typically respond pretty well to issues, we'll assume they'll do the same. I'll continue to attempt to play the game and keep up with some updates, but for anyone looking to invest... wishlist it and let the game get to at least a playable state.\n\n","April 3","false","16.8"," 293 of 345 people (85%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","85","293","345","13","15"

Most of the negativity surrounding this game is based on how overwhelmingly buggy it is right now.  That is 100% true.  But it’s still an awesome game.\n\nI can already feel all those negative fingers twitching over their keyboards waiting to drown me in hateful comments, but let me explain my reasoning first.  I agree: THE BUGS ARE EVERYWHERE.  Early access may even be a little misleading in this one.  When I hear early access, the first thing that comes to my mind is one of those new indie games that’s totally functional, but needs a lot more content.  This is not that.  This is early early access… This game is Super ****ing Mega early access.  We are basically alpha testing this bad boy.  If you are not willing to occasionally fight through bugs or lose a coaster once or twice, don’t buy this game.  The fact that they are still charging full price for something so incomplete is my biggest issue with the game right now.  Almost every aspect of this game has at least one significant issue that needs to be worked out.\n\nHowever, I ended up giving this a thumbs up because all of the problems are seem to be superficial.  When they are fixed, I am 100% sure this game will be fantastic.  All the bugs, such as, the faulty AI, the wonky EID ratings (excitement/intensity/nausea), the path placing issues, etc. that everybody is complaining about are all very fixable.  I have played many games (early access or otherwise) that were just inherently bad.  Bad concept, bad controls,  un-navigateable menus, bad whatever…  But keep in mind, this game is Super ****ing Mega early access, and the core of the game, the most important part, is rock solid.\n\nAnd what is the core?  To me, the most important part of any theme park simulator is the coaster editor itself.  I have seen many negative reviews claiming that this one is over complicated and hard to use.  I struggle to even wrap my head around these claims.  When I first started playing this, before reading a single review, my first thought was, “Man, this coaster editor is ****ing amazing! It’s so easy to use!”  I hate to step on people’s toes, so I’ll stomp them instead.  If you put any actual effort into figuring out how to use to use the editor instead of giving up after 5 minutes, anyone in their right mind would be forced to agree that this is by far the most elegant and free form coaster editor yet.  There are practically no limits to what you can do.  Besides, even if the node editor somehow isn’t for you, the prefab piece editor is still present and works just fine.  Although I encourage you to take all other complaints and reviews you read seriously, it is important to me that everyone laugh in the face of any person that says the coaster editor is hard to use ;).  Kidding…  By the way.  But, seriously the coaster editor is awesome.\nSince the other reviewers have so completely covered the specifics of the many bugs, I don’t feel compelled to cover them in my review.  In any case, I am confident that given time, they will all be fixed.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThis game is not even close to being done and full price is fairly unreasonable.  DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT SOMETHING FULLY FUNCTIONAL.  Give it more time, it’ll get there.  But if you’re like me and you get a kick out of seeing a game in its early stages and watch it fill in, give it a go.  If you want to give a game a negative review because its buggy while in early access, maybe don’t buy early access games in the future…  You clearly don’t appreciate the development process.

Dev's say it's "over 50% complete", but IMO that statement is crap and they know it. Atari's community management staff also need a lesson in etiquette and accepting popular opinion (more on that below).\n\nTo start with the game briefly, it's not even close to 10% of what RCT3 already gives us. Yeah, I can hear the fanboys screaming "oh, but geek - it's early access" - and it is - but nothing has improved since that original alpha. I stream this for just 2 hours’ yesterday, and despite the graphics and textures looking like something from 1995 (even on highest settings), FPS barely struggled to nudge far past 50 on a system with an i7-4790K and SLI GTX 970's. Peeps were also blurry up close, or moonwalked/stutter across the map if you zoom out to far. Foliage and other assets were pixelated (trees actually look like Minecraft) up close, and often just disappeared randomly for no reason. Staff also don’t work and scale of buildings is way off. A drinks stall is larger than the carousel for example. Don’t even get me started on the apparently fixed coaster builder. There's no banked corner pieces of track in any rides for a start, and motion paths look very rigid for the coasters. It doesn’t look natural.\n\nThen there's Atari's community management. Want to make a thread saying the game is not great? It gets deleted. Make the thread again, you get perm-banned from their site. Mention Planet Coaster on their Twitch and YouTube streams/channel, get purged buddy. Go look at the forums on their official site - it's all full of praise and users defending the title. If they perhaps put as much effort as they do in moderation into the game itself, it wold probably be a lot better.\n\nSave your money, buy Planet Coaster or just hold off on this until it's finished (if that ever happens). There's a very, very long way to go and they have no money. How do you think this game will turn out?

I like this\n\n\nCONS (THINGS THAT ARE WORSE THAN THEY WERE 12 YEARS AGO):\n\nGRAPHICS AND UI\n-If there were no curved paths in this game, it would almost be GRAPHICALLY IDENTICAL to RCT3 (2004!)\n- I get memory leaks where the game eats up to 26GB of my RAM. I am guessing not all players have 32GB ram to deal with this issue!\n-The interface looks VERY bland. I am not asking for candy crush but I’ve seen accounting software that looks more exciting than this.\n\nPERFORMANCE ISSUES\n-My FPS is actually fine for the first 1000 peeps on max graphics. As soon as I get over 1500 peeps (easily achievable with 2 of the 9 park tiles), my game becomes unusable. The game freezes for 5 seconds every 30 seconds, crashes around every 15 minutes, and takes over 2 minutes to save the game (no joke).\n(I have i7 3930K, GTX 970, 32GB RAM, SSD)\n-Once my park starts to be a decent size (3 tiles or 2000 peeps) the game can no longer save or open it without freezing.\n-I have not heard anyone with over 2000 peeps in their park claim that it is running smoothly.\n\nHow can I be motivated to spend time building something that I can no longer use once it starts to get interesting?\n\nPATHS\n-Building paths can be a pain when connecting to other paths or building up or near hills.\n-Changing the path material means destroying anything connected to those paths (LIKE SHOPS) as the game will not allow you to place the path directly next to them again.\nTo fix: Add a material paint brush tool in the path menu and avoid the issue altogether.\n-The game is SO PICKY when it comes to snapping benches, bins and shops to paths. They won't snap to positions that look perfectly acceptable and by default they seem to want to snap off the path onto the grass.\nTo fix: Allow intersecting geometry and free placement of path scenery and allow shops to be freely placed much closer to the paths. Let your users judge what is intersecting and what looks good for them.\n\nPEEPS & STAFF\n-The peeps animations are very wooden and they don't walk as families or groups like they did 12 years ago.\n-Peeps sometimes stop walking in queue lines and hold up the entire queue for a few minutes.\n-From birds-eye level the peeps stutter around the park at 2fps\n-Sometimes all the peeps in the park disappear all at once and gradually start spilling in through the entrance.\n-Staff are often seen sliding around the park without moving their legs like ghosts.\n-Staff are often seen walking adjacent to the paths, phasing through all the scenery like ghosts.\n-Mechanics are often seen congregating at ride exits, phasing through each other like ghosts.\nI am pretty sure the staff are ghosts.\n\nRIDES\n-THERE ARE NO LOG FLUMES\n-THERE ARE NO TRANSPORT RIDES, how hard can it be?\n-While you can build rollercoasters piece-by-piece like you could in RCT3, parts like helix sections, loops and barrel rolls are missing.\n-Coasters built or edited with freeform tools lead to a very un-smooth ride when finished. Something as simple as a descending helix can be a nightmare to build smoothly.\n-Adding a lift-chain is way harder than it needs to be.\n-It is not yet possible to change the colours of shops and non-coaster rides.\n-The pre-built coaster stations are much larger and more realistic than RCT3 but you cannot choose where to put the entrance and exits.\n-Tweaking an existing coaster can be dangerous. Clicking on a section of track to make a banked curve sometimes causes the camera to move which causes that piece of track to move way out of place. You then have to spend ages putting it back into place to avoid an unwelcome s-bend in your coaster.\nTo fix: GIVE US AN UNDO OPTION! Alternatively, allow us to lock certain axis’ when needed.\n-Deleting parts of a coaster can be very tiresome after it has been built.\n-Building pre-built coasters from the menu is an absolute nightmare in any park that is not perfectly flat and barren.\nTo fix: Give us an option to snap lowest part to terrain height and automatically bulldoze any scenery that would get in the way. At the very least allow us to see the ride supports during placement so we can see how ridiculously high off the ground the base of the coaster is going to be.\n-Pre-built coasters do not display any excitement/nausea stats.\n-All my coasters have ridiculously high nausea ratings while I think it looks quite safe.\nTo fix: allow us to see that nausea heatmap on our ride while we are building it if we want. At the very least, give the guests time to visit a toilet at the ride exit before puking everywhere. There are never any staff nearby to mop it all up.\n\nTERRAIN\n-Adjusting terrain under rides or roller-coaster supports is totally forbidden\n-There are very few terrain materials available. This is like an hour’s job for a texture artist.\n-There are no waterfalls like there were 12 years ago\n-You cannot build tunnels like you could 12 years ago\n\nSCENERY\n-No building blocks/wall sections like in RCT2&3. I don’t want to have to trust an amateur Maya modeller for well-optimised and decent looking models without ridiculous stats from the steam workshop every time I want to build architecture. I want to design things myself. Look at what planet coaster lets you do!\n-Selecting scenery items freezes the game for up to 5 seconds each, and occasionally CRASHES THE GAME ENTIRELY\nTo fix: if you don’t have budget to optimise your game any further, at least allow autosave.\n\nIf you can bear these problems for a few hours, zoom out and look at your park from above with all of its curvy paths and freeform coasters it can actually look quite realistic.\nThe fully working park management aspect is a fun challenge and is just as addictive as the original games.\nSince no other title can claim both of these points at the same time yet, yes I would recommend this game to keep you busy until Planet Coaster comes out at the end of the year, after which, you will probably never touch this game again.\nHowever, as I am unable to open saved parks (loading screen crash)  and experience memory leaks after they start to get big I cannot yet recommend this game.","April 1","false","22.4"," 128 of 162 people (79%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","79","128","162","15","5"

Almost 2 months have passed since the originial release of RCTW and the game has been improved a lot from its original state. The devs make use of the bugtracker and have fixed most of the more severe and some small bugs the users have been complaining about whilist still adding new features and improving the overall game experience, which is reflected in the community and the content the users have created. It will still take a while for RCTW to become a solid game, but it gets closer with every update. As of now I will still put a "No" recommendation on it, as it is not completely worth its money yet.\n\nOriginal review\nRCTW got rushed into early access before it was supposed to, as retailers sold the game before it's release. Thus the current state of the game is rather terrible. It has a bunch of bugs, some more severe than others, workshop integration isn't fully functioning and the performance is rather bad.\n\nRCTW adds a lot of new features to the RCT series though. More customization, more user generated content, more park management. The coaster editor now features a node based building system, similar to the one seen in NoLimits, which allows the user to create coasters with more freedom than ever. Of course the "Piece by piece" system still exists. Curved paths and grid-less scenario placing allow the player to put more detail into their parks and staff now requires buildings to "rest" in.\n\nHowever, the worst thing about RCTW as of now is it's community. People expected the game to be complete and a fully functional successor of the RCT franchise. Of course they got disappointed when the earlier-than-early access version turned out to be.. not so great.\n\nUnless you absolutely want it, I'd recommend you to wait and watch the game develop.","May 20","false","8.0"," 83 of 96 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","83","96","4","5"

Quite enjoyed it. There were a lot of bugs and glitches, but no dealbreakers as it's still early access.\nBut when I started a scenario and looked at the way those parks are built: horrible. Seriously, who builts a park like that?!\n\nThe coaster builder really needs some work. When I build a coaster over water, it crashes. When I try to make a coaster as realistic as possible, it crashes for unknown (probably ridiculous) reasons. The prebuilt coasters are built really bad and therefore should definitely crash, but they don't... They really look like a 2 year old designed them.\n\nOther problems I encountered:\n- Peeps couldn't enter a coaster, the entrance was properly built but it seemed like there was an invisable barrier.\n- You can only adjust the direction by 5 degrees when building a coaster. Normally this wouldn't be a problem for me, but sometimes it gets stuck at (for example) 42 degrees when you need 40 degrees, so you get ugly wobbles in your coaster.\n- Coasterphysics when it comes to speed: it just keeps going... really could use some more loss of speed over the course\n- The breaks on the coaster builder don't make sense: you can't fine tune them at all, and are almost impossible to use midcourse\n- Result of the break issue: running more than 2 trains is almost impossible\n- The image rocks a lot sideways when riding a coaster\n-  Paths are difficult to build: when you want to connect two paths, it restricts you in only a few possibilities.\n- The game randomly crashes: so be sure to save your progress often!\n- Peeps keep walking around hungry, even though I placed an abundant amount of foodstalls/restaurants\n\nThis list could go on a while.\nFor now, I wouldn't recommend this game, as it's not worth the price.\nI really hope these problems are gonne be resolved. I know it's still early access, but there are so many problems which make me question if it will be fixable.","April 1","false","12.2"," 120 of 153 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","120","153","6","2"

So, if you aren't one of those people, looks past the percentage people found to be helpful; it will probably be less than 50% because of those few blind haters :) Anyway, lets begin.\n\n\n\nI find much of the hate towards this game to be sort of a "bandwagon mentality" and the endless comparisons to Planet Coaster. I just bought this game today, and I actually really enjoy it. The issues and bugs I've experienced so far I believe are easily fixable, and based off the number of bugs being fixed over the past few updates I'll say that this game is really enjoyable so far. Here are the Pros and Cons as of 4/21/16 :\n\n-PROS-\n\n-> COASTER BUILDER! - For people saying that its hard to use, I totally disagree. First time using it I recieved some pretty promising results. The freeform builder is quite easy to pick up and extremely powerful if you know what you're doing, but if you're not into that kind of life you can build the coaster piece-by-piece like in previous RCT games. Basically, it has RCT3's coaster editor, plus much, much more. (EDIT 1: After working more with the builder the only complaint I have is the camera responds to corkscrews, heartlines, and other twist-style inversions really poorly. Other than that the coaster builder is still great)\n\n-> LOOK - I may not be that critical of graphics, but if I were to think about it I'd say the graphics are quite nice! (If you've seen youtube videos where the game looks like trash, don't worry; the graphics have ALREADY IMPROVED since launch)\n\n-> CUSTOMIZATION - Many of you guys will slam this feature down in this game as it's just becomes an instant comparison to Planet Coaster in everyone's head, but the customization in this game is actually quite good. The grid works quite well, and you have many foliage options, trees, rocks, spotlights, and other goodies to doctor up your park and make it look great. Check out the featured parks for examples.\n\n-> UGC - Until Piece-by-piece structure building is implemented, we are here working with User Generated Concent from the Steam Workshop. UGC in this game is actually more powerful than some may believe, because UGC can actually ALLOW for piece-by-piece building on its own, and then some. Don't underestimate the power of UGC!\n\n-> UPDATES - Some people (esp. on YT) have speculated that this game will linger in EA forever, and eventually die off. However, we have already recieved two updates with noticeable improvements in coaster physics, staff, graphics, water, bug fixes, coaster physics, peeps (somewhat), and other improvements. This shows that this game will only go uphill from here, and the devs have stated numerous times that they've noted many bugs (57% x.x) and are still in the process of improving the game, adding features, and fixing bugs. This may not mean much to some, but I think it DOES mean a lot because of the two updates we have already recieved.\n\n-CONS-\n\n-> PERFORMANCE - I'll compare this performance to another Unity Game: Cities Skylines. RCTW undoubtedly performs worse: when you zoom in close to a path it lags a bit, and that's with only 300 peeps or so (EDIT 1: Lag does get worse with the size/peep increase of a park. I'm pretty tolerable of lag myself because my pc used to have integrated graphics (now I have a GTX 970), but do keep this in mind...). I'm not sure how well the game performs with lower graphics settings, but do keep in mind the performance. Hopefully the graphics will improve in the future.\n\n-> PEEPS - They don't look very good, but my main complaint at the moment is their sounds. Haven't noticed any "sexual peep behavior" yet, but the echoing of their voices and their odd emotional sounds is a bit cringey. Again, hopefully this will be fixed; they have addressed this concern for future updates already.\n\n-> PATHS - This is actually a minor complaint, that path system ISN'T TERRIBLE (esp. with the handy grid system), but path's snapping to random places really needs some work. Again, this concern has been addressed, so it should be fixed soon.\n\n-> EIN - Those ratings are still so insane even after the update; It doesn't take much for your intensity to skyrocket.\n\n\nOverall, I've had fun for the amount of time I've played so far (IT WILL GROW), and I hope this game will go uphill from here. I haven't come across many bugs at all (EDIT 1: I played a bit more and there are indeed minor bugs all over the place. If you're willing to work around those it shouldn't be that much of a problem...and the updates have been fixing bugs rapidly so that's reassuring...), and absolutely no game-breaking ones, but I may update this review to include future bugs that I find. Nonethless, hopefully with the release of Piece-by-Piece building and the final release in general, RCTW will be able to rival Planet Coaster for the top Theme Park Sim spot. Many people deem it impossible, but I still believe that it can happen.","April 21","true","15.7"," 347 of 491 people (71%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","71","347","491","16","15"

The fact is that this game has a solid base to build off of, and that is what people need to take away from it. I own both Planet Coaster and RCTW, both are hardly finished and both, in my opinion, have a positive future ahead of them. Also, Hats off to Nvizzio for keeping in touch with the community and rolling out updates as quickly as they can. With all of that said, I'll list my pro and cons.\n\nPros\n-Coaster editor/maker in this game is EXCELLENT, Sure its a bit finnicky sometimes, but it's damn good and can only get better, I prefer it to the piece by piece editor in PC, it's one thing I hated about RCT3.\n-Decent variety of scenery to start and I'm sure this will be expanded upon\n-Solid amount of flat ride content with a new one coming every 2 weeks in Major patches (Yes, I believe them, they have stuck to that schedule so far)\n-I'll probably be crucified for this, but after the latest update..graphics have improved markedly, and I'd expect that to continue\n-The Management aspect is there, could be better but it's decent for EA.\n-Terrain tools are easy to use and effective, need an option for underground building though.\n-There is more but I'll leave it at that for now, new update is scheduled to be rolled out Tuesday or Wednesday next week so I'll edit this review at that time\n\nCons\n-Peeps need work (Animations/texture/etc)\n-Optimization at this point is a bit shaky, people across a wide array of system are getting mixed results, once the park gets large it really starts to slow down, apparently this is getting addressed in next patch, I'll update if that is the case\n-Pathing is shoddy at the moment.\n-AI behavior is pretty poor in the current build, mechanics don't always fix rides, janitors are slow, etc.\n-Water quality sucks. lol.\n-Can't change ingame graphics while in your park. (Seriously guys?)\n-Can't place scenery on elevated paths (Again, really guys?)\n-Coaster ratings need work, every coaster I make is a vomit comet\n-General bugs and such\n\n-Overall, I'd recommend this based on the rate it is improving and the committment Nvizzio has shown to the franchise. I'd expect good things as time goes on.","April 16","true","21.6"," 184 of 249 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","184","249","9","2"

The peeps don't look as what would be expected, the realistic coaster supports are just never there with any of the games in the series unless modded in. The limitations in the options menu is saddening. Seeing the difference between Planet Coaster and RCTW; RCTW isn't the same and its missing quite a lot for what this game use to be. As a fan i'm heartbroken to even suggest to anyone who could be a fan as well. I'm giving it a chance and hopefully the developers will listen to its fans who have patiently been waiting for years for the next installment and make this series worth playing again. Its gameplay has some good ideas within the game, but it greatly needs improvement. I'm giving this game a 6/10 in my opinion.

Go in with an unbias take on the game.\nYes, this is Early Access, but nothing in this game feels like it will be special when it's done. It's essentially a worse version of RCT3 without a grid system. It's also much more awkward to work with than RCT3.\nPlanet Coaster is the way to go with this generation of theme park games, it doesn't have everything yet, much like this game, but what it does have is stunning.

It's a very steep price to pay for a game that feels like it's still in alpha. It's not a complete broken mess as some other reviews suggest, it's just got very little content to keep you interested for more than 4-5 hours. My general feeling is that the developers are completely missing the point of what people want out of a theme park simulator - it's like they've sucked all the fun out of the game by taking away the creative freedom of themeing a park. By themeing I mean creating something from scratch, not simply placing two pre-made centre pieces side by side! My main gripe with it is that it's doing anything to build on RCT3 - even if they add lots more content, it will only be on par with the previous game in the series.\n","April 2","false","2.6"," 108 of 148 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","108","148","3","1"

I have an absolut beast pc but the game lags so hard all the time even with an empty park that i cant play for more then 10 mins.\nPath making is the worst iv ever seen in any game PERIOD, is the snap function some sort of inside joke? because its ALWAYS ON. paths do as they want and there is no room for people to get creative as there is no clipping allowed, the grid system is just some sort of crule prank and the peeps animations are reminisant of early gameboy graphics.\nDon't get me started on placing buildings, just.. just dont. it's not even worth explaining how frustraing and down right crap it is.\n\nOne pro i will give this game is that the way you build coasters is really really fantastic, its so simple and feels so natural to me. Shame the game can only achive 2 fps on a 980ti and i7 so you cant enjoy that either. It honestly has gone backwards from the beta weekend. Please Atari get a new developer on this ASAP as Nvissio seem to be the most budget and clueless group to ever make a game.\n\nPlaying the alpha of Planet coaster, well it already has a ton more content, far better graphics and runs like a dream. It leaves you to create anything you can possibly imagine. trust me when i say you should pick it up its just the game we always dreamed of, made by the original devs of RCT3 and their passion /  love and attention clearly shines through on planet coaster.\n\nEDIT: alot of people say that the 2 are totally different games, but that isnt the case at all, obviously they have differences but they are the same. its crazy not to think that. My biggest beef is that this game had a release date last year! and what they have now is easily 1 or 2 years away from release.

Seems like 1 out of 3 of them ether puke on the floor or throw garbage, making it impossible to keep up with the cleaning of the park. You can't pick them up anymore. I could go on.\n\n- The park workers: Picking them up is very choppy and not smooth. having to find them instead of having a menu with all of them listed get's frustrating. Because so many guests seem to want to litter and puke every 10 steps you need an army of them to keep the place clean. You can no longer set them to be in a certain area ( was nice to set them on specific, always messy paths.\n\n- The FPS: The frames per second of the game dramatically drops after you get over 1000 guests (which can happen within the first hour or so of playing). And yes, I have a great gaming laptop that should allow me to run it. It becomes unbarable and unplayable after just an hour or two of building up your park.\n\nLack of customization: Can no longer render the buildings or coasters a different color. Can only select a small number of pre-made buildings. designs of pre-made buildings seem lazy, copied like other buildings with slight changes.\n\nRoller coaster building: It all feels confusing and complex and it's so difficult to get it exactly the way you like it. It should be a simple build consept first, and if you feel really creative, go into the expert custom mode. You can no longer change the train cars, or how many train cars you can have. The train stations are too big.\n\nMy personal thoughts: I believe they really wanted to deliver a great game but unfortunately for everyone it just isn't up to par. RollerCoaster Tycoon has been one of my personal favorite franchises since I was a kid, and to me a game like this shouldn't be about graphics, but more about the gameplay, the options, the customization. I think all those qualities suffered because they wanted the game to look pretty, which is unfortunate because the game will even make the strongest of computers lag and make the rollercoaster tycoon experience unenjoyable. Little glitches here and there can be easily fixed, but from what I can see so far, the major issues are irreversible at this late stage of the game, even at early access.\n\nIt pains me to say this, but I do not recommend this game.\n5/10 Rating\n\n-Darkwisemonkey","April 10","false","2.6"," 107 of 153 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","107","153","3","6"

My husband & I have been Atari fans since we got our first Atari Game System back in like 1981. Anybody remember Pong? Yeah...we're old...\nWe bought the Deluxe version of this back in Nov thinking the release date would be Dec 10th.  We aren't upset about spending that money, however, we're shocked at what this has turned out to be so far.\n\nThe Pro's\n1.) Early Access- good on Atari to recognize that they needed to put something out there.\n2.) Performance- we have a great computer that my husband built, so no performance issues like others have had.   Occasional choppiness, but hey, it's a computer game.\n3.) Graphics-the parks actually look really pretty.\n4.) Coaster builder- far from perfect, but we actually made several cool coasters & each one took less & less time. The problem is that both the coasters & the pieces to build with are disproportionately large & the test stats are way off. (What exactly is the safety rating about, does anyone know?) I hope some of this is fixable & being worked on.\n\nThe Con's\n1.) Navigation- we shouldn't have to use the keyboard to scroll around the park. It's not 1989. And can I please have an Undo button? I make a lot of mistakes!\n2.) Music- I know Matt said they're working on the custom music, but can we please put a rush on that before my head explodes? The music from RCT3 was so superb, I'd love to be able to import that into this game. Does anyone know if that's possible?\n3.) The Vomit- really? Every peep pukes coming off every ride? And now they pee on the path if they can't make it to the rest room? Sorry, but it's disgusting & childish.\n4.) Paths- we don't even know what to make of this. Very cumbersome. And we can't place buildings right on the main path. Not liking that at all.\n5.) The Peeps- it's like Night of the Living Dead went to a porn flick. What's with the weird moaning? And can someone please make the kid stop crying? I think my ears are bleeding. The peeps have no personality at all. They don't appear to be happy, sad or anything in between.\n6.) Rides- again, many seem disproportionately large. It just seems as if things aren't properly scaled. The fact that we can't move the entrances & exits is very odd. Why not? Also, the rides seem pricey, so why do we have to purchase the sign going over the ride?\n7.) Complaining- there's too much of it. It appears as if you all have taken a page from the first Zoo Tycoon, & not a good page. The animals were great in that game, but the peeps made me stop playing because of the constant complaining about things you couldn't even fix. Please don't make that same mistake with this game.\n8.) Buildings- way too many restaurants & the builings are huge. Seriously, who goes to an amusement park thinking, "Gee, I hope I can get a great Moo Goo Gai Pan while I'm here!" And if you eat sushi, then get on a roller coaster, you're an idiot. No wonder there's puke everywhere. Don't get me started on the huge, ugly, unnecessary employee buildings. I hate this idea. But the Dev Blog dated April 1st states they will also be adding an admin building. And where are we supposed to place that? We have no room left in the park to place a rolller coaster, and with the park entrance being so huge, can't we just pretend that's where the employees go to rest? It's just a game, it doesn't have to be that realistic, it just has to make sense.\n9.) Breakdowns-is it just me or did the rides start breaking down as soon as I opened the park?\n10.) Entertainers- Oh. My. God. This is the worst thing of all to me.  The Dev Blog dated April 1st said the entertainers will amuse guests while they're queuing. I mean no disrespect, but did you guys actually play this game? I watched one exit their building, walk down a path, enter a queu, interact with exactly no one, turn around & go right back to his building. I told you those employee buildings were a bad idea! And I'm sorry, but that huge, hulking, ominous, predatory owl looking thing is just scary. Remember the shark entertainer from RCT3? My husband & I still love that guy. We named him Jerry. We would turn the game to its lowest speed so we could watch the kiddies laugh & jump up & down as he tried to bite their heads off, then he would joyfully skip away, with his little red sneakers on! So cute. Yeah, that's all gone, along with all the charm, cuteness & personality that was RCT3.\n\nWe don't know what this game is, but we do know that it isn't RollerCoaster Tycoon. We have nothing but faith in Atari to make this right. We will continue to play, for what it's worth, and will amend our review as we see fit. Thanks for listening!\n\nPS- I'm not kidding, can I please have Jerry the Shark back???\n\n4/7/16-So, after today's update, still awful. Oh sure, the peeps LOOK better while they're peeing on my path right in front of the rest room, but my janitors are still ineffective. I do think the mechanics are working faster & I do appreciate the flat map. They have a long way to go before this review comes out of the thumbs down status!\n\n5/24/16-So I went in the game today for the first time in weeks. Sorry-still awful! It's not even interesting enough or fun enough to waste another minute playing.

I mean, I really want to thank you. I bought this game in November, at this time, you told us it would be released on the 10th of decembre. It wasn't. Okey, I thougt, no problem, they need time and I wanted to give you more time. I thougt, when the game finaly will be released, it will a be a FINISHED game. BECAUSE I PAYED FOR A FINISHED GAME! 45€!!! Yeah I know Early Acces CAN be great, BUT NOT FOR A FULL-PRIZED GAME, WHICH WAS SUPPOSED TO BE FINISHED!!! So okey nevermind. I know Early Acces games, which are very good indeed, they are nealry completed, just with a little performance problemes and allready with a lot of content. Fortunately your game does not have this! Haha! So until now I just threw meaningless phrases around me, like the frame rate in this game is throwing up (pun hahah) all the time, so I will just tell you, what I don't like. But one more thing, ALL these things are in case tiny little things, RCT3 does not have this problemes, so why do you start including them now?! Why can't I build entirely straight ways, after I build an attraction? Why is everything so freaking big, it looks ridiculous. Why is everything so big, but the park space so small, I can't even build one big rollercoaster. Why there is so little content? Why is the performance just so bad, even on the lowest settings? Why can't I build a rollercoaster through a rock and in the ground? Why is so much missing? And so much more!\n\nSo the biggest question, why can't you just wait until you finished the game?! I would have wait, even a long time, but nooooooooo, you just gave me a half-ready game, which doesn't perform well for, wait for it, wait for it, the legendary full-prize of 45€. Nice, well done. FORTUNATELY I did not bought the game on steam so I can't even give it back. So yeah basiacilly I will just wait now until the game will work better and if you can't fix it, planet coaster will come and hopefully they will make it better. BUT you can still fix this all, work on the performance, just reboot RCT3 and make the a few well needed changes and PLEASE keep the things that worked.

The coaster builder is beyond terrible, so frustrating trying to build anything. Good luck placing buildings down that connect to your paths. The most frustrating thing to me so far besides frame rate is building paths. Everything i do is invalid and you cant simply delete a path that i know about. You have to click bulldozer, click the path, click paths icon, click the path you want, then build again. Honest opinion from a franchise fan is it's a huge step back from RCT3.

Based on the potential of this product, I have to give it a thumbs up. Why? I really like the new editor, among other things, but no doubt, there's a bucket load of problems with the current build. For one thing, it needs to appeal to the casual crowd, as well as the vets. In the end,  you should be able to build just about any coaster  with realistic results that RCT3 couldn't provide. In its current state, RCTW is a mixed bag of "Oh cool!" and "yuk, why?" moments,  but you sense a gleaming gem under the pile of black coal.  The scenery is rich and detailed, and the path creator is amazing (though needs a lot of work as well).  Most of the program is locked down right now, so you can't experience flat rides, money management or other features in Beta 1.\n\n\nThe Good:\n\nCoaster Editor - Spline Editor coaster builder. Powerful, flexibile, but might be frustrating for novices.\nGraphics - coasters,  foliage, scenery items, main entrance, parking lots, lighting ... gorgeous!\nPaths - Very cool path system allowing curves, and super easy to use. It has its problems, though.\nPeeps - they're ghosted right now, but based on the PAX video, they're looking pretty good.\nSave/load parks - fast, and saves in the cloud\nUI -  not so pretty, but easy to pick up. Needs lots of refinement.\nSome useful shortcut keys\nLandscaping and terraforming. Nice! Easy\nOpening music (not important I know) is really nice! Kudos to the musician(s)\n\nThe Bad:\n\nCoaster Editor - It needs work - messy right now. This can use lots of prefabs for those who don't want to spend a lot of time on coaster building can get on with the show.\nObject/path placement Limitation -  Everything has barriers - we don't want another RCT3 where we can place two rocks together without red warning signs. That's gotta go.\nPaths - while awesome compared to RCT3's way of doing things, they are super finicky with uneven landscapes and certain scenery that is too close.\nFrame Rate - sporadic. The program is not optimized so it's a given.\nQueue lines - not pretty. No stairs, just ramps.\nGates/wall placement -- one by one placement.. slow way of doing things. That's got to change.\nSound - not too much yet, and it's flaky at the moment.\nSome important functions don't have shortcut keys.\nNo Undo option just yet.\nKey coaster elements missing. Example:  No pause brake before drop on the Dive coaster.\nFirst Person coaster cam. The devs said it was preliminary, they weren't kidding.\nFixed Entrance/Exit  -  that's severly limited! Maybe they did this for a reason...who knows.\nInitial Load - yow is this slow as heck!\nTerraforming - needs fixing here and there.... takes forever to flatten a raised area.. Needs a winder radius to work with.\n\nThe Ugly:\nMajor memory leaks - slowly but surely it will eat your PC alive.  Best exit and reload often.\nTrain Stuttering. No, this is not lag, it a strange choppiness of the train movement. This alone is my biggest turn off.\nOverly sensitive Nodes - makes it frustrating to go back to edit parts of your coaster without messing it up..\nOn demand grid - Needs much better implementation and simply not working right.\nThe included prefabs- they were designed by Freddy Krueger\nSupports - they're a mess right now. The more closer the track intertwines, the likelihood a support will be where it shouldn't.\nThe crash sequences  - the physics are way off.\n\nAfter the bug reports and suggestions from the Beta 1 community, the devs have their job cut out for them, but as long as they're dedicated, we will be there to enjoy the ride,","November 1, 2015","true","109.0"," 94 of 150 people (63%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","63","94","150","13","2"

I'm going to try my absolute hardest to give a review on the game without resorting to comparisons. Any point of interest I place an asterisk (*) at the end of is possibly subject to change, and reflects the March 30th launch only.\n\nThe good:\nCoaster builder - Very useful and well-made. The color safety guide is also very helpful for setting up your coaster in advance as well, so that you can know what does, and does not work.\nArea themes - Adds an interesting way for scenery variation to effect certain areas. Also contains variations of each building as well.\nSteamworks support - Modding adds unlimited potential in every game.\nTerrain editing - Excellent terrain manipulation tool. Not really much else to say without adding pointless padding.\n\nThe okay:\nPaths - We finally have curved paths, along with several variations. Only problem is that it can occasionally get wonky with terrain collision, or pathing intersection. No curved queue lines, sadly.*\nScenery selection - Decent amount of stock scenery with the base game, however certain themes such as Sci-Fi are lacking in options. Modding could fix.*\nDifficulty - This is bad for me, but some people prefer it easy. I'm a veteran of RCT and RCT2, so I prefer biting my nails when it comes to funding, however just building a small portion of the park, and working on a coaster can set you for a good while in terms of funds.\n\nThe bad:\nFences - Fences are badly implemented. Can only place them one at a time, and at angled intervals. Hopeful they will add line tools, or at least an option to place along paths.*\nStaff - Staff control is basically minimal at this point. Place the building down, select how many you want hired, and hope they do their job, let alone efficiently.*\nPerformance - There are certain options to minimize graphical load in exchange for increased performance, however certain tools, will bring your frame rate to a crawl under certain circumstances. (EX: Path tool works fine unless it's clipped to an existing path, in which case my frame rate drops by at least half.)*\nGraphics - Not great, to say the least, but they could be much worse. I don't really come in to Unity games with high expectations, though.\n\nOverall, it's not as amazing as RCT1 and RCT2 obviously, but I do like it more than RCT3, which I never really transitioned into. On launch, it's a 6/10 for me. I'm curious to see where the future updates will bring this though, as I really do see potential.","March 30","true","11.5"," 371 of 632 people (59%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","59","371","632","28","12"

I paid full game money and got a pre-Alpha build. I expect more from Atari. This is why you see everyone everywhere saying not to pre-order games. Reminds me of when the new Sim City launched, now Maxis is dead. I get that we’re on the 3rd dev now but this is insane.\n\nDon’t buy this game. It is not worth $50.\n\nFirst off the graphics are sub-par, at best, and even on low settings the frame rate is awful. There are terrible issues with building scale, little food stands being as big as full rides for starters. There is barely enough content to make a themed section of a park.\n\nI basically used up all the rides in 2 zones. You get 9 zones. WTF am I supposed to do with the rest of the zones? Make my own coaster with 20 FPS and a terrible coaster builder? The coaster builder sucks. It is not intuitive. It doesn’t let you add special tracks easily; you can’t make the kind of coasters you want. I was trying to make a simple Six Flags Superman style ride. Can’t do it. RCT3 could do it. How does a full version of the game not have at the very bare minimum what the last version had? RCT3 came out in ’04 and you want me to believe you can’t have all that stuff added into a new game in ’16?!?! If they had just taken RCT3 and put it into a new engine so it looked better and ran smoother, I’d be more happy than I am with wasting the money I did on this garbage.\n\nPathing is awful. There is a lot of really weird snapping and even using the grid it’s hard to make straight lines. Curved paths almost seem easier which doesn’t make sense.\n\nThe delete tool is garbage, and… oh what’s that you want to play one of the scenarios? Cool. Have fun trying to place rides anywhere. If there are trees or tiny little bushes you can’t plop stuff down, you first have to use the god-awful delete or move tools to get rid of the plants. One by freaking one. You would think you could just right click and the game would know you want to delete that stupid bush but apparently that’s too much to ask for.\n\nThe list goes on and on. You can’t get your staff to do what you’re paying them to do. There is literally no guidance for how to please people or how to keep them from puking after every damn ride. Even the giant slide. The economy is dumb.\n\nDon’t buy this game. Odds are Atari is going to pull the plug on it rather than give it dev time it needs. You would literally be better off taking $50 and and burning it for the few moments of heat it provided you.\n","March 31","false","7.3"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

I am keeping in mind that this is an alpha, however; it is stil just as dissapointing to me. When you look at Roller Coaster Tycoon you recognize a franchise that is well known for being composed of quality games. Well I'm sad to say that after RCT4 - Mobile and the Alpha of RCTW that this may now be a false statement. As a lifelong fan of this game (I've been playing it since the original and since I was old enough to understand how to play video games) I am remaining cautiously optimistic about the future of this game, I see its potential and the ability of the community to greatly improve each other's experiences through the vast network of custom scenery objects now available on the Steam Workshop.\n\nIn its current state I'd rate the game no higher than a 5/10 and here's why:\n\n- The coaster builder is VERY clunky, occasionally it becomes impossible to continue building as you need to use the presets to place a piece before you can freeform it. This causes issues when your piece wants to dive underground, yet you wish to freeform it and keep it above ground.\n\n- Staff buildings, now some will say this really isn't an issue (and I agree to an extent) however, by making staff members simply components of the building we place we lose our abilities to both customize them and set specific routes for them, two things that were nice about RCTW's predecessors. I do like the idea of the staff buildings and it adds a little more realism, however; for it to work for me the same level of customizability present in its predecessors must also be available.\n\n- FPS drops, now I have a top of the line computer (one capable of running Fallout 4 on near maximum graphics settings) so running RCTW shouldn't be a problem for my computer AT ALL. Unfortunately the reality is that I'm plagued by random FPS drops and "input lag" at least 70% of the time I spend on this game. The worst part is that it happens in almost entirely empty parks - Atari you really need to work on this.\n\n- Lack of flat rides, I understand that this is an Early Release (alpha if you will) however it would be nice to have some more generic flat rides that aren't soo heavily themed. Perhaps an option to toggle what the ride's theme is? I'm not sure if anything will be done about this but if you're going for one specific theme your options are quite limited.\n\n- Scenery placement, all of the previous games had this issue as well. Planet Coaster is the only one I've seen that has done this right soo far. I'd love to see scenery that we can place anywhere so that we can properly theme rides/areas. What is the point of having a giant tree with a hole that looks as though you could run something through it if you can't put anything through it?\n\n- Lastly I'd like to say that I feel this game should be MUCH farther along than it currently is. No I do not know anything about video game developement and yes I know there were three developers working on this game. Nvizzio, if you're reading this please take what I've said and will continue to say as constructive criticism. I love the RCT series and I want to see this become a AAA title, but right now I see a game that is waiting to die upon release. RCTW was originally announced to release in Early 2015, it is now Early 2016, and we only have an Early Access. Slow and steady wins the race and making a quality project is 100% always better than rushing out unfinished garbage, however; I feel a year of delays for this game is enough. Nvizzio, Atari, this is crunch time. The community will not continue to stand for delays, you're already losing your fanbase to Planet Coaster. I'm not saying rush a finished project, I'm saying make sure you do this right in a timely fashion. The fan uproar that you see now and the fanbase's lack of faith in you is only the beginning if you really mess this one up.\n\nTo conclude I would not recommend this game to anyone, not until some serious work is done. I will continue to mess around with it but I really doubt I will play this anywhere close to as much as I played the past three. If you want your money's worth now I'd buy Planet Coaster or Parkitect. Although honestly who knows, I have faith in the team at Nvizzio that they truely want to deliver a AAA title for us fans and I'm willing to ride the storm out and see where they take us.","March 30","false","9.7"," 46 of 69 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","46","69","0","0"

It is a great franchise and still loads of fun. All of you may know that the fourth installation in the series was avidly awaited by many a fan. After a troublesome development history, yesterday the game came out in early access. It is facing stiff competition from Planet Coaster and Parkitecht, so comparisons between the two are inevitable. Nevertheless, in the promo-video's, dev-diaries, etc, the devs vowed to come with something worthwhile.\n\nSo what came of it? To put it bluntly: An unfinished, unpolished alpha-build that is rife with bugs. The potential is there, especially in the coaster builder, but the detail, the path-tool, the management-aspect, the graphics  and the camera-handling are far below par. It is essential that this is going to be adressed in the near future. The communication by the devs towards the coaster-community is in this regard not very encouraging. I think it is only fair that the devs have to come with an open and honest statement about the development stage and a feasible time schedule which lays out at what times what issues will be fixed and what kind of content will be added.\n\nRCT world has potential. If they get the coaster tool working in a proper way, it even has the potential to outshine Planet coaster in at least one regard. But so far, this product is not ready for sale and an embarrasment for the franchise. Let's hope that the devs will quickly do what needs to be done. Come clean to the fanbase and coaster community. Only then can they regain some credibility....","March 31","false","0.6"," 29 of 41 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","29","41","0","0"

If you want to play the TRUE sequel of RCT3, buy Planet Coaster (Early Bird Alpha Edition). This is just ANOTHER "Park Construction and Management Sim" that got called RCTW. I'm not going to point out the reasons, if you don't believe me, patch your eye for 2 hours and try both games.\n\nStraight to the point..\n\nThe Track Editor works well, with less than 5 minutes toying around you will be able to create smooth, visualy fluid and funny rides.\n\nNo Transport Rides, no Mini Golf.. among others.\n\nThere are some restrictions while placing scenary objects that sometimes can be a bit anoying.\n\nIt is possible to make curved paths, to do them visualy pleasant is not that easy.\n\nTerraforming works like a charm.\n\nTextures are not impresive for a 2016 game.\n\nPeeps are not same we used to see in RCT3 which is the most iconic part of the game.\n\nAs expected in Early Access, you will get some lag, random freeze.\n\nThere is a lot of work to be done and i hope the game improves over time but for now is not possible to enjoy it.\n\n\nMy advice: If you are a diehard RCT fan, please do you a favor and get Planet Coaster.

Once beta of this game came out and all the negative publicity started, I thought for sure the developer would truly start caring about how to fix it and make it all that it could possibly be, especially with fierce competition from planet coaster (which I bought beta access for at the same time as buying RCT world). After playing both I was truly amazed at the level of complexity planet coaster gave it's peeps and the level of detail involved in the game even at such an early stage of developement. I unfortunately was not impressed with RCT world, I wanted to like it soo bad, I wanted to ignore the negative publicity it was getting and keep an open mind and stay positive about how this game could one day be truly amazing, but after the negative beta release which I figured would tighten up their boot straps, The game just doesn't deliver, especially at the cost their asking. I found pathways to be incredibly difficult to place, especially at the entrance of the park where nothing seems to connect, or connect straight for that matter. Also peeps look very bland, If you compare it to PC, its a no brainer, there was no time or thought put into peep movement, intelligence, or even just simple gestures. I found rollercoaster building to be fun and intuitive but when you finally finish the coaster and ride it, it studders and shakes on the track which gets annoying, which was also mentioned in a recent review video. The graphics seem so outdated and bland and when you zoom out the peeps skip frames as they walk and it looks terrible, BTW the graphics were cranked to max and i run dual R9 390x video cards in crossfire. The game may one day be extemely fun to play and easy to use, which i truly hope it is because I will definitely buy it again (I refunded it), but at this stage it is not worth the price tag and it seems the developer has not improved much since beta, so it's difficult to see this game improving from it's early access state, i truly hope I am wrong though. I would not recommend this game at this stage especially with planet coaster right around the corner and looking very promising, so far iv had nothing but fun with that game.","April 4","false","3.0"," 30 of 45 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","30","45","0","0"

(Mobile and 3DS)\nBut this game is barely playable, even on a high end pc.\nThe FPS drops are huge in this game, even when your park is extremely small.\nAnd I am noting this as I can play most of the newest game on the highest settings with a solid 60 fps.\nBut, back to the point. This game... I don't know how to describe it other then it just being... terrible.\nTrying to build paths (Yes paths...) drops my fps to about 1 frame every few seconds. I literally can't place the paths.\nThen there is the shops wich are impossible to connect to paths.\nSame for benches and what not, almost impossible to place how you want them to be.\nThe AI isn't only bad, they also look horrible... the quality of the peeps is just... terrifying.\nRCT3 had better looking peeps then this game.\nThe coaster builder, well... It's ok. It's not good at all, it's extremely buggy.\nYou can't make a nice looking coaster if you don't place all the nodes by hand.\nThe flatrides look ok atleast, if that is any good if the whole game is bad.\nThere are many good ideas in this game, don't get me wrong! But this game is not worth €45,99.\nThis game feels more like it's worth 5 to 10 bucks. ( If it is even worth money at all )\nAnd now imagine this... This game is in Beta. This game plays like it is pre-alpha. But it is in Beta...\nPlanet Coaster, is in pre-alpha. That game feels more like it is in Beta. And most of the features in that game are missing!\nI hope this game can become somewhat good. But right now, I have a feeling it won't.\nThe only way to really fix this game would probably be to start over most of the features that are already in the game.\nEverything needs fixing... that's all I can say about this game. I honestly think it would be best to try and start over the development.\nBecause most features in this game don't work as they should.\nI'd rather be restricted to building paths on 90 to 45 degree angles then to have to deal with all these bugs and lag.\nI'd rather have the grid back again, then have the problem of nothing placing properly.\nHonestly, I would be happy if they literally made it like the previous game with better graphics and what not.\nBut I think this game is just a lost cause. I tried to give it a change. But it's just, really bad.\nAnd this is not the developers fault, they had to work on a game that was broken to begin with.\nSo yeah, just don't buy this game, save yourself some money. Don't buy it because of the title saying RCT.\nIt's nothing like the old games, and not nearly as good. If the game does get better, I will update my review.\nBut until then, please don't buy this game.\n\nEdit: I have a feeling this review is getting downvoted by people that didn't actually play the game.\nIf you want to try it, go right ahead, I just don't recommend you waste your money if there is cheaper/better alternatives.","April 21","false","5.2"," 134 of 234 people (57%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","57","134","234","7","0"

It is useless to try to build a park because it lags even the best machines. The path system is rubbish. The free-form placement is not that at all. It a money grab.

For me, making free-form coasters was the absolute dream. I'm a bit of a coaster freak, and I finally had a chance to rebuild my favorite coasters around he world in my parks. I could not have been more hopeful, and after hours and hours of figuring out the finicky coaster building tool, I finally created an exact replica of El Toro at Six Flags. So when it had an intensity rating of 21.7, ultra-extreme, and no peeps would ride it, I was understandably disappointed. My next few attempts produced similar results, though they were all exact replicas or closely based off of many of the prominent coasters in the world today. To put hours into this difficult process only to have the majority of my peeps not ride it and a massive pile of vomit in my exits is, well, not good.\n\nFine, gameplay mechanics be damned, I would do what I could do build an aethetically pleasing park incorporating realistic roller coasters. I put even more hours and hours into this process, only to have both the parks I built crash the game before being able to load. All of my time lost.\n\nUpdate after update promising updated coaster mechanics and improved realism and all we get is this bull.

I understand it is still in Early Access and I'll still give it a chance to fix its problems until the full release, but it is definitely not what I was expecting given that I've been playing Roller Coaster Tycoon games ever since the original in the 1990s. Still, I'll try to list my impressions about the game as unbiasedly as humanly possible.\n\nI really like the interface. It's simple, it's clean, it's modern and it's elegant. It's refreshing to see a modern take on an interface when, even today, most games still go with tacky and bulky interface designs.\nPathing needs a lot of work and I'm finding it really hard to get my paths to be how they I want them to be. It's pretty hard to get nice, snaking queues, for instance.\nThe graphics are okay. Not great, but not horrible. But then again, I think graphics are the least important thing in a game. While in some cases quirky graphics may contribute to ambiance, in most games graphics just don't matter and RCT games are games where it doesn't matter, imo.\nI actually really like the coaster editor. It's a pretty powerful tool once you get used to it.\nStaff control is very basic at this point and could use improvement.\nI'm not the best guy to really assess performance as my computer is already somewhat outdated at this point in time, but I feel it could be better. Considering I can play XCOM 2 with acceptable framerates in a medium graphics setting, I was expecting to run RCTW more smoothly than I do. In particular, loading times seem to be particularly slow on my machine and I've had a few crashes when loading Scenarios.\nTo sum it up, in its current state, RCTW still has a lot of issues. It has good points and bad points and, while I am willing to wait and see if the issues will be fixed in future versions of the game, I can't really recommend it in its current state.","March 31","false","3.6"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

I played the game during the first Beta weekend and it looks like they just added in the peep textures, a couple flat rides, and just released it again.\n\nThere is a metric ton of stuff missing, and menus and buttons are still in weird places, And seeing as this was going to originally release in December 2015 this is unexceptionable. I mean fence builder was the biggest complaint from the First public beta and guess what...There is still no sign of it in the game other then on a to-do list on their website somewhere.\n\nThis is still a beta build, but for how long they have pushed this game back you think there would be more than 10 coaster types or even building for that matter.\n\nI think they tried to get the jump on the market by trying to release the game a year early. Even if you ignore how ridiculously bugging it is then its still missing content. Stock RCT3 Had more content at launch then this game does 4 months after it original launch date and multiple betas.\n\nMost of these complaints are about the studio behind this game and how poor their development cycle is if this is all they have to show for multiple missed release dates and multiple open closed betas.\n\n","March 31","false","19.5"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","27","41","0","0"

The coaster builder is laggy and physics are so horrible. The game crashed on me when I have my park while in load of 1,950 guests which is total disapointment, I had that problem on RCT 3 most of the times on my older machines. I run a PC with a GTX 760 2GB VRAM, 16GB of RAM, and an 2nd Gen Intel Xeon and it would lag like crap while building a coaster.\n\nOctober Beta Weekend 1 Review (11/2/2015):\nThis is probalay the worst game that you would buy for $50. I feel like they are rushing to push this game out and they have over a month left to complete and polish it so it looks like $50 but not this piece of unstable crap. When I test ran my coasters that it will crash on random parts of the track. Yes, this game doesn't have any sense of physics what so ever. When I put tight banking that I get a message "slope too steep", this is the first RollerCoaster Tycoon games to not introduce grid building. The game will crash and freezes at times and I guess it has something to do with the camera modes.\n\nWell, I can't really expect or recommend this to be good just for the $60 I have spent (I have bought the Deluxe Edition) if there's any improvements. If this game came out this way then I will feel very turned down and regretting myself buying this game that won't work at it's price.

There have been many negative reviews, and I can see the frustrations that led many to leave such, but a lot of those seem to have dismissed the game after a few moments of play. Not giving the game a chance to show off its potential.\n\nAnd in Early Access, potential is what we want to consider, The foundation that RCTW has laid is such that it may very well grow into that potentail we can glimpse. Should UGC become full, and each day we see more pieces added, should Piece by Piece building with the UGC be solved, and each update we see that happening. Then the foundation could lead to overwhelming success.\n\nAt present, for those who are creative, the park builders, I would say the game has enough that you can find many hours of contentment playing it. For those who are problem solvers and want to play scenarios, we are not quite there yet with needing AI to balance better, with the scenarios to be tweaked better.\n\nBut for the $50 price, it is closer each to day to be the successor to RCT3. At present the trajectory that it is on, may never get us to being equal or better than RCT3. But perhaps one rung below it. Though should more coaster types, more rides, more more more be released, then it might even surpass RCT3 for at present the graphics are better.

(Its honestly only a bad soundtrack away from being a horror movie.)\n\nPerhaps this is just a glitch on my end, but half the time buildings and rides don't actually show you whether or not they are closed which led me to accidentally forget to open half the stuff in my park. (Oops!)\n\nI also noticed that the days seemed... Shorter? Like, almost ridiculously short. I feel like they could be slightly longer. In order to see my park at night I have to lock the time set to night time or else you'd miss it if you looked away for two seconds.\n\nThere are so many little things that could be fine tuned, that would make this such a great game. I want to like this game so bad because a huge chunk of my childhood was spent playing both RCT2 and RCT3. RCTW is just not holding up compared to even RCT3.\n\nI'm hoping the developers really are serious about improving the game because it has so much potential. Until then, I cannot recommend it.","May 1","false","1.6"," 35 of 57 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","35","57","0","4"

Honestly though this game doesn't live up to the franchise. The graphics are better than RTC3, but not 8 years better. The motion of the rides and peeps is not smooth. The graphics appear more cartoonish, less realistic. The game frequently hangs up or freezes and it loads very slow. Not nearly as many options as previous versions (ie no transit rides). The curved pathways are neat, but nothing lines up properly when using those tools (hedges and fences don't follow curves). Hedge and fence pieces are all one length, which leaves gaps. Limited tree options and no bushes. Peep movements are not natural, nor is their vomiting habits and urinating on the pathways (seriously?) I could go on and on.\n\nI want to like it, because I loved RTC 2 and 3, but it just is not there. I realize this is early access and I think the devs can fix many of the problems, but I don't see them going back and redesigning all of the graphics to the level you might expect them to be for a game created in 2015-2016. They really have a lot of work to do, and as loyal as I am to the franchise I don't see them pulling it off properly. I hope I'm wrong because I messed with it for an hour longer than the refund policy allows...","April 2","false","9.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","1"

It's so far from finished that I can't believe they're saying it's full featured enough and they're just releasing the base game so they can add more features later on. No, the serious problem here is that the base features that are available right now just plainly don't work, and even some simple things just don't exist (you have zero control over staff, for example). I can see the potential here, but so much stuff is just so broken. The real redeeming quality of this game is the coaster builder, but just about everything else doesn't seem to work.\n\nI'm so glad the devs decided to dump this into Early Access, because otherwise I would've felt so betrayed. I still feeled betrayed though, by the high price for such an unfinished game. I really hope the developers get their act together. I could barely even start my park because I spent like 30 minutes trying to understand the convuluted and idiotic path building system, and my paths still look awful. Even the wonderful coaster editor needs some polishing, it doesn't really give me enough realtime information and my coasters kept flying off the track.\n\nHere's my first look at the game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwTBWBjcHFM\nClearly I wasn't in the correct mindset to be playing a buggy game (yeah let's play what is essentially an alpha right after major surgery), but at the same time this game is barely even ready for Early Access.\n\nI continued that first look with a video dedicated to the wonderful coaster editor here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZS0TyjgQEA . It still needs work, unfortunately, I was really hoping that it was going to work out of the gate. It IS fun though, but you generally end up making puke machines that rate low on the in-game excitement scale.\n\nWould I recommend this game to friends? Not right now. Would I maybe recommend this game to friends in the future? Probably, as I feel like there's a lot of potential for this to be a modern version of the first three RCT games. Will this game ever be worth $50-60? No, probably not. You guys are reeaaaally pushing it with that price point, I would probably pay max $30-40 for this, even if it were full-featured and polished.","April 1","false","3.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

I was ecstatic when I heard this game was coming out and preordered it....a year ago. Now fast forward a bit after the two messy beta weekends where the game was nowhere near completion. Then when the game was delayed from December (I think), I sent out a refund request to Atari so that I could get my money back for the many disappointments and they started to work with me. After giving them my receipt information like they requested...I didn't hear back for weeks, I sent in another request to get my money back and nothing. I figure it's because they knew the game would be releasing soon...and a few days later, they released that it would come out on March 31st. So, whatever, I am abandon my refund request cause what the hell. And then I play this piece of ♥♥♥♥. I know its still early access but come on everyone. This game barely runs and I have a nice enough rig to play Fallout 4, GTA V, Borderlans Pre Sequel, and Skyrim all out high to intense graphic settings with no problem. This? The FPS drops to around 15-20 when more than 2 rides are placed, or I'm building something, or a significant amount of peeps enter the park. This is early access, but this is not okay. This game should be able to do the basic things, and it just doesn't deliver. I will review this game again once it gets out of early access, but for now I am done wasting my time on this.","March 31","false","2.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

YES this game has the Roller Coaster Tycoon title but does it really feel like the RCT we know and love? Not really to be completely honest. I was so excited for this game to release and my s/o was generous enough to buy it for me when it was available for purchase so I didnt really spend my OWN money on it. But I do feel for those who did pay for it themselves with their OWN money. I have enjoyed the game so far to a point but I have run into a few issues and these are kind of major ones.\n\nCoaster Customizations:\nThis is a big one for me! I absolutely love building and designing my own coasters and I figured this point to point style system of building would lead to some REALLY cool coasters. And although it is a very useful thing its a bit confusing at first to use. But what I was really disappointed in is that there is a lack of pre-set parts for the coasters such as loops, corkscrews and twists. Yes they have some but then when you do use them they seem to have messed with the coaster a bit and changes the way it works entirely.\n\nAnother complaint with the coaster builder that has REALLY frusterated me is how the BRAKES SYSTEM doesnt seem to WORK PROPERLY (at least for me) now it may be something that I am doing wrong but I get to a point where I want to have the "Block Breaks" so I can add a stop point for a second coaster to pause at while the other coaster is at the station. Ive done it in 2 and 3 plenty of times. But when I test the coaster it seems to give me the error that the "Coaster did not complete its circut" and then the second caoster never takes off? This is really weird to me and would like a bit of an easier block break system.\n\nThe final thing with the coasters and really the rides overall is that you cant really customize them too much. Like for example; you can change the colors of the tracks but you cant really fully customize the train cars, you have preset trains available. But I would like to see the ability to add patterns and change individual colors on the trians. Maybe instead of the individual color boxes you can choose, try implementing a COLOR WHEEL with ALL the RGB colors on them?\n\nScenery options are a bit of a disappointment not much able to mess with there.\n\nALSO THE BIGGEST ISSUE I AM HAVING IS A HUGE ISSUE WITH MY MEMORY RUNNING LOW WHILE PLAYING THE GAME FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR!!\n\nI have 8GB of Corsair Vengance RAM DDR3 1600MHz and IDK WHY I am getting the error that my computer is running out of memory....\n\nThats really all the issues I have with this game. I like it when it works, but it needs some fixing. I would recommend the game but not at this current time.","April 4","false","5.1"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","21","32","0","0"

He, however, remembered that I've always been a huge RCT3 fan since 2005 and I still play that game to this day. It's just a colorful pleasure every time.\n\nTHIS game... well... let's first get the most important thing out of the way:\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME for the current asking price of 46 Euros!!\nI understand that many want to support these developer but... seriously... if they DARE to throw this game on Steam in THIS state, they don't seem to care about it all that much anyway. I for one don't expect them to really put any true passion in this product anymore. I do realize that they've called it "Early Access" now, but that's only because they've realized (by having that beta event) that their customers can't be deceived that easily and immediately called them out on HOW unfinished the game really is. This game should get MANY more months of thorough development and quality assurance and could then be released. Everything else is just BS, if you ask me.\n\nRemeber the feeling of playing the old RCT trilogy? How much fun it was to enjoy many hours in that colorful, sunlit atmosphere, just watching the park visitors laugh, kiss, play and have fun? How well-rounded it all felt? The friendly and yet functional interface, the music, the whole look and feel?\n\nThat's all gone now.\n\nThe people in this game look like hideous soulless creatures. The last time I saw such an atrocious design of humans was in Egosoft's "X Rebirth" (remember those grandmas?). They're just uncomfortable to look at. (So that's why they never showed the peeps' faces in their official trailer/making of videos...)\nThe interface looks like a gray, neutral, managerial iPod-like interface. COMPLETELY devoid of color. Just gray with white lines. Yeah, that just screams "fun", doesn't it?\nThe terrain in this game manages to instantly disappoint. Really. Disappointment at first sight. And even when you've started building and embellishing your park... it STILL looks cold and bare. Hard edges everywhere and with a strangely gloomy lighting.\n\nIn the previous games you looked at the empty terrain and the colorful interface and you wanted to dive in!\nIn THIS game, you instead feel an urge to quickly build *SOMETHING* in order to fend off the depressing atmosphere.\n\nThere are countless comfortable options that are left out. Filtering your available structures by theme, to just name one.\n\nI just feel sorry for Nvizzio.\n\nAtari has become a disgusting publisher, really, which became painfully evident by their recent trainwrecks "Alone in the Dark: Illumination", "Asteroids: Outpost", "Haunted House: Cryptic Graves" and the ridiculous mobile cashgrab freemium "game" titled "Rollercoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile". Recycling titles of popular (sometimes iconic) franchises and churning out utter garbage.\n\nSeriously... until "Planet Coaster" by Frontier Developments (the original creators of the RCT series) is out, just stick to RCT3 Deluxe. "Rollercoaster Tycoon World" just isn't worth your time so far. It might be when it's finished, but it's FAR from finished at this point.","April 1","false","3.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

This includes things like bugged repair guys who are unmovable and you cannot fix rides, or none of the Janitors cleaning anything, or all guests bugging out and not riding anything and causing you to run out of money and the guests needs meters dropping and them  being upset at your park.\n\nYou can't build a park bigger then about half of the starting area at the moment, because the game becomes very laggy and can lead to crashing or more bugs appearing.\n\nThe current state of the game plays like an Alpha more then a Beta, which has not been play tested AT ALL.","April 3","false","70.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","14","19","5","0"

And yes, I realize that it's an early beta for the roller coaster builder. But the roller coaster builder (the core of the game) is absolutely broken. I wanted so badly to like it.\n\nWhile the spline editor is a great idea, it just doesn't work in any feasible way. You'll pull out your hair trying to refine anything, and forget about making straight track. The result is an ugly, unrealistic, gangly, and awkward roller coaster that takes up way too much space and barely runs. There's no precision and the controls are so touchy that you'll find yourself screaming at your computer. Skill aside, it shouldn't take over an hour to lay down a lift hill--only to have the train randomly crash on a simple and shallow (forced by the game) pre-lift drop.\n\nPlease delay the full release of this game. Go back to the drawing board. Try compromising the spline editor with the piece-by-piece system to allow for the compact and interesting coasters the franchise is known for while keeping the smoother rides.","October 30, 2015","false","1.6"," 195 of 356 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","195","356","9","13"

After the horrible Sim City release, I said I would never buy another game from EA and now Atari has done the same to the RCT series with World.\n\nI'm not sure who they are hiring to program these games anymore (cheapest folks I guess) but I'm in complete shock at the condition/state of this game (early access aside).  Before these games get issued to the public the CEO should play for at least 2 hours because I can't imagine any CEO who cares about quality or name recognition would consider releasing a game in the current state of RCTW.  If possible, I would hope Atari would just scrap this game and provide an amazing update of new props, flat rides and coasters, etc. for folks to incorporate into the existing RCT3 (please consider).\n\nMy experience with the current state of World:  Load the game / before entering into a scenario or sandbox choose the quit button - a pop up appears and asks "would you like to quit game" - Choose Quit - pop up disappears and takes you back to the main menu without quitting game.  The stinking main menu doesn't even work.  Nothing works. The limited coasters in early access don't line up very easily and each one I built had major graphical issues of all types, the paths are a complete and utter joke, the paint colors (only 4) have one for sand that is a dark brown vs. white (labeled wrong I guess), the sandbox mode has no empty base map so plan on spending 2 hours deleting/leveling before you can even use the sandbox, very limited on flat rides and coasters, options to tweak them is null to very limited - flat rides are a joke (look cool) but not useful for designing into a realistic/personalized park due to the art designs incorporated into them, peeps walk on and through just about anything including thru fencing, landscaping, etc.\n\nI'm just livid that another favorite game from my youth has been completely and utterly destroyed to the point of which you know another release will never happen.  Sorry - but I find it shocking that PC Game Makers like Atari can't build a game better then what it was a decade earlier...I guess the end of PC games is just around the corner.\n\n","April 2","false","8.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

I, like most other people reviewing the beta, grew up with the first two games, and still play them to this day.\n\nPros:+Terrain editing and manipulation is FANTASTIC. Very easy to use and navigate, much more so than any of the previous games. Creating valleys, hills, mountains, holes, etc. is super easy and intuitive, and the water tool is much simpler than in previous games.\n+Pathing is also a huge improvement in RCTW. You can change the size of paths, as well as create curved paths. Much easier and less tedious to lay down as well.\n+Game itself is very pretty to look at.\n+Camera works like RCT3, a positive in my eyes.\n+I don't hate the coaster editor like some other reviews have stated. To be fair, I rarely messed around with it in the previous games. I'm not creative or talented enough to create anything worthy of laying down in a park, so I always relied on pre-built designs and online downloads for my coaster needs. That said, I found it simple enough to use after getting through a relatively steep learning curve. My biggest complaint with it is that the mouse sensitivity is too high, but I'm assuming (hoping) that we will have the option to tone it down upon release.\n\nCons:-Physics seem way, way off. Coasters seem much too slow, and coaster stats appear to be questionable at best.\n-Time passes, way, way too fast. An in-game day goes by in what seems like 15 seconds, even on the slowest setting.\n-Everything seems too "big". This is a difficult one to explain.\n-This seems like a game that is six months to a year from release, not one a month and a half away. Menus are basic and ugly to look at, there are very, very few decoration items (assuming that there will be mcuh more at release), and descriptive text in menus is completely missing, or occupied by generic placeholder text.","October 31, 2015","true","2.3"," 56 of 98 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","56","98","5","0"

Please read the entire review to know why I don't reccomend this at this current moment.\n-\nGeneral Overview\n\nLikes:\n- Path customization\n- Good variety of pathways and scenery in general for beta.\n- Water physics\n- Terrain Deformation tools\n- Good looking UI\n- Guests were spooky ghosts only for a limited time since it Halloween is approaching as I am typing this.\n\nDislikes:\n- Crashing!\n- Takes ages to recover from a crash.\n- No options to change settings such as audio, graphics, etc in the beta.\n- No snapping to objects like fences to make placement faster\n- No grid!\n- Can't remove added trains when customizing coaster.\n- Framerate is all over the place.\n- No tutorial!\n\nNoticed Bugs:\n- When doing something else on your PC while RCTW is loading, the game tends to crash. (e.g. opening steam overlay, leaving window.)\n- Once placing station and forced to edit the coaster, when accidently exiting before placing a track and going back to edit wont allow you to place any track and gives you an "Invalid Location!" error.\n- Tons of black little dots appear on the main menu sometimes.\n\nSummary\n\nHonestly, I felt kind of dissapointed with the beta. But don't get me wrong, this game has major potential to be something big and unique but at the current stance of the beta, I'm kind of iffy on what was only given to us to provide feedback. But anyways, the beta included great elements in the coaster builder which included a lot more coaster customization when laying out the tracks. It didn't feel like it was only a set of pre-modeled tracks and looked like it gave peeps whiplash when making tilted turns (like in rct3) and allowed me to make smooth, curvy tracks. The only thing that gave me a problem in the coaster builder is that there was no way to remove added carts! This is a major key feature in the coaster builder! But if there was a way to remove carts, feel free to correct me.\nThe pathway design improved a lot since the previous RCT game. Now there is the ability to make curved paths which is fantastic, and also realistic! There was also a variety of pathways to choose from and also had different sizes which allowed a lot more customization to the game. Not only there was a variety of pathways, but also a variety of scenery to decorate your park. This included many lampposts, benches, trees, etc to use! And to even add onto that, the Terrain Deformation Tool allows you to customize your park with pretty, vibrant hills with also the use of the terrain sprayer. It also included a water tool to make lakes or ponds.\nNow don't think the beta was all fine and dandy! There was also many things that I was dissapointed about which was the lack of a tutorial, which pretty much there to show you how to play. It was pretty much get into the game and figure out what to do. Although it did not take long, I eventually figured out some of the controls. And one thing that bugged me the most was the placement of pathways, stations, and scenery since there was no grid to make things neat. It also helps alot when creating straight pathways. Also the game pretty much crashed a lot in the loading screens, framerate was all over the place, and there was no options to customize your game. Hopefully this will get added soon for the second beta!\n\nBut yeah, to conclude this review, I do not reccomend this game yet because it can go either way. It could go terrific or can go bad. If you are really considering, I reccomend it if you are a fan of the RCT series like me, and support the developers of the game and provide tons of feedback for them to read!","October 30, 2015","false","1.7"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","23","37","0","0"

It is that game what I install everytime something bad happened, when I'm ill or when I want to destress. Install RCT 1, 2 or 3 and you have a smile on your face in a minute I can guarantee you.\n\nThe game has it's own character. The colors, the happy peeps, balloons and the cartoony artstyle without being a casual game at all is proven a strong a concept and I think after many years this game is still a lot's of gamers favorite.\nIt was RCT that I saw on friends PC's screens, even on them who never play any other video game.\n\nRCT World fails in every aspect to reproduce the freedom and creativity and addictive feeling of the older RCT games.\nEven when the game did not suffered from technical bugs, 3D glitches, broken sound/music, bad optimization and way too less content it was a bad game. It's missing spirit, comedy, freedom and everything what makes the RCT series great.\nThe peeps are boring to look at. They don't have any style themself. It seems the dev team could not choose between realistic and cartoony and choose to design a mix of photorealistic characters with cartoony movement models. Everything moves too fast even on slow setting on a slow engine. I did met the sys req. for the game (the minimum) but whatever graphic setting I use after I place my first rollercoaster the game can't deliver anymore.\n\nObject placement and path placement is ridiculous. The terrain tools very user unfriendly. You can't place path where you want, even if it seems to fit perfectly the engine don't allow you to place anything on random places. Tools you have like a grid and a snap grid makes this even more worse.\n\nYou can only place objects directly to the ground. You cannot place anything on top of something else. You can't even place banks, lights, carbage bins anymore on paths when the path is higher then the ground level. You can not build anything anymore in the game itself. (It's advertised that you can build anything in any other 3D tool and import it).\n\nThere is almost non to zero customization. You can't choose the main building, the entrance building, thematic entrances, place of entrances etc etc. It's all setup for you so the only thing you can do is build a prefab item. No creative building anymore.\n\nYou can't assign staff, can't train staff, can't change the colors of them. It's all setup. Same for food stalls, ticket stalls, peeps etc etc.\n\nThe management tools are not complete. The menu to read info about your parc is very hard to read. It's just a plain spreadsheet directly imported from the engine to the game. No nice menu's, no humor, no cartoony style and just a plain and simple click and place building game with a tycoon parc theme around it.\n\nLast but not least the amount of content you get at the moment is 1/30 part of the original RCT games. You have 6 rollercoasters to choose from, 4 different terrain types (instead of 18 in RCT 3), a few thrill and a few junior and family rides. All rides are fixed and you cannot change anything yourself. But even if you could the amount of content provided by the game itself is so minimum. You can choose between some rocks and some trees and a handfull of decoration pieces.\n\nTheme parc building should be something that makes you happy and should be happened smooth and relax. This game is slow, frustrating, ugly and simply misses anything that could make a game like this fun.","June 4","false","29.9"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

They hired a studio that had no reputation to build the game originally. They wasted a lot of time and money and didn't have anything to show for it.\n\nSince Atari brought Nvizzio on to finish the game, huge improvements were made in short amount of time. I have a lot of respect for the hard work Nvizzio is doing.\n\nStill, Atari set horrible expectation during the whole process and they've not done a great job of communicating with people following the progress of this game.\n\nI'm fairly against pre-ordering games, but after the progress I saw Nvizzio making I decided to pre-order to show my support. They didn't deliver on any of the pre-order perks and went silent again for months. Until today.\n\nNow the game is releasing in Early Access, which I'm typically a fan of, but I didn't pre-order an unfinished game. Obviously being Early Access the performance is pretty horrible, even on high end hardware.\n\nSo yeah, don't buy this game. Not yet. I think it will be great in a year or two, but right now it's just a mess and Atari doesn't deserve your money for how they've treated this game.","March 30","false","2.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Frankly, $30 is quite a lot to pay for a kid's game.\n\nThe campaign game, whereby grown-ups attempt to achieve goals, seems buggy.  The first time I played it, it gave me the option to build a handful of rides, but no paths.  Even as the game was telling me that I needed to build paths so park visitors could reach the rides that I'd built, it was giving me no option to build a path.\n\nThe second time I played it, it gave me a paths option after a few minutes, and then a buildings option.  Then, after I'd built a few buildings, it took the buildings option away, and refused to restore it, even after I'd expanded the park substantially.  The game was telling me that my visitors were hungry, but denied me any opportunity to build restaurants.  The game told me rides were breaking down, but denied me any opportunity to build mechanic stations to provide the machenics to fix the rides.  Eventually, my park simply ground to a halt.\n\nAt no time did the campaign game provide me an opportunity to build a flower bed.  I see lots of screenshots above of luscious parks, with lamps, and decorations, and attractions, but my experience is that you can only create such scenes in the sandbox version in which everything is unlocked.  Althogh I played the campaign games to the point that I had fairly extensive parks, never could I have constructed the screenshots in the publicity.\n\nPaths are the single, most-infuriating thing in the game.  In real life, you can build a path anywhere.  In Switzerland, they buld entire freeways across the Alps and through some of the world's largest mountains.  So why is constructing a dirt path across your theme park a great world of "You can't do that"?  You need to make very certain in advance of where your paths are going to go, and you can't add to many extensions to them without extensive demolitionand reconstruction.  Visitors on the path constitute obstructions, so if you're hoping to rebuild a major pathway, you have little option but to close the park and wait for the traffic to clear.  This will take a very long time and represent a potentially catastrophic loss of income, but it's the only way you can reconstruct a path!  Other problems with path construction are too numerous to detail here.  Suffice to say that probably noting in this game will raise your blood pressure  more than path construction.\n\nAll this said, the sandbox version is a lot of fun, in a SimCity kind of way.  If all you want to do is construct the theme park of your dreams, and then ride on all your attractions, it's great.  But I find it extraordinary that the developers have allowed the program's very obvious weaknesses to go ahead -- or even that the program's weaknesses weren't taken with in previous versions.  By the fourth version, you really shouldn't have to be enduring the frustration of non-functioning software! Actually, you shouldn't have to endure it in the first version.\n\nIt has the potential to be a really brilliant game.  Were it not for the bugs, it would be.  But it seems to have been released on a premise of, "It'll do."  The assumption seems to be that, if the graphics are brilliant (and they are superlative!), the public will forgive you if they don't actually work.  Well, I'm not a programmer.  I don't play a game for the joy of exclaiming, "Egad!  What good-quality graphics!"  When I pay $30 for a game, I expect it to have been thoroughly tested and to work perfectly.  And this game is anything but that.","April 27","false","23.0"," 36 of 62 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","36","62","0","2"

I had hoped that it would be a great game! But sadly it is missing SO MUCH and it is no where close to properly optimized. This is the first game on my just built PC that actually lags when I am building stuff.\n\nSo to not just complain, here is a list for the dev's on what they may be able to do to somehwat salvage the game.\n\n1). Optimize your ♥♥♥♥, I mean really optimize this game because holy crap.\n\n2). There needs to be more variety for rides and buildings, this game is over 10 years old and the original roller coaster tycoons have more rides.... you need to be surpassing that. Things like swimming stuff should already be in the game and not something that would be DLC because they where already in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3.\n\n3). Back to touch on something of optimization. You can't make a single path straight and that is starting to ♥♥♥♥ me off, nor can you place objects on paths basically wherever you want. This should not be an issue yet it is, I don't see how it can be an issue but you guys seem to have made it an issue.\n\n4). Fix the terrain tools so the brushes are larger when you are closer so that you can actually see if you have gotten everything down to the level you want it or up to the level you want it. I am constantly having the problem where I think I got it all then I build something and notice I didn't.\n\n5). Optimize the peeps, both workers and guests, so they stop being so dumb about things. I basically have to have a janitor/mechanic for every ride I put in the park because they seem to not move quick enough between everything. As for the peeps, every thrill ride and coaster I constantly have a path covered in puke even if I put a bathroom right next to the exit...\n\n6). I think that you guys may be heading in the right direction but there is just simply not enough in the game at the moment to get my recommendation. This may sound harsh, and it is, but I wouldn't even want to release the game with how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it is at the moment. Add things like research and development into the game to unlock things, don't gate them behind completing parts of the campaign. That is tidious and annoying when I have no real control over what I want more of.\n\n7). Developers, listen to your audience and realize ♥♥♥♥ is going wrong at the moment. For example the grid, well since the grid isn't properly alligned at the moment it doesnt work, simple and easy fix but yet you guys haven't done it. Just please listen to your audience so that you stop getting such negative reviews.","April 3","false","9.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

However after i've seen this beta so far, there's still alot they'll need to improve, but the tools you do have are excellent compared to other coasters.\n\n- It's like Cities Skylines of Roller Coaster games, mainly because the community is huge for this game, and steam workshop. A lot of people fear that there's only 10 coasters, don't worry just wait 1-3 months and you'll have pretty much every coaster in the world to play around with. Not only can you share what you've made, but also most likely see legendary coasters in-game. But for every coaster i guess they'll look on highway systems from Cities Skylines for an example where you could pick different interchanges from the community, in this game under speciality, you'll most likely find extreme versions of loops, corkscrews and etc.\n\n- Even though the game is pretty good so far, as i said earlier there's a lot of features they'll need to add. It's almost impossible to make something 100% straight, and i will go cry in a corner if they don't add such a feature, because that's mainly one of the few things you'll need.\n\nSo after this review, i would say the game got a bright future, but it takes some time to get used to, i really wanted a tutorial in the beta, just to know how the mechanics work. It's nice to being able to tweak EVERYthing on your coaster. But they should add classic mode coaster building from the older games. All in all if it was up to me i would give it 7/10 for now, but it's only in beta and hopefully it will only improve from full release 10th dec. But lets see how the next beta goes, and if the game actually improved or they'll need to push the release date a few months.","November 2, 2015","true","6.6"," 55 of 99 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","55","99","8","3"

RollerCoaster Tycoon, a brand once loved by millions already reeling from the abomination that was RollerCoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile has now been damaged further (perhaps irreparably) by the travesty that is RollerCoaster Tycoon World.\n\nThe whole game smacks of "My first Unity project" with Atari/Nvizzio having taken every shortcut possible to produce this game for the minimum amount of expense possible.\n\nWhat the game's current developers (Nvizzio Creations) have done in this game is to essentially throw in lots of copy & paste assets making minimal changes such as stores that are all but identical aside from a change to the awning and some garish object stuck to the roof in order to distinguish it from every other copy & paste building.\n\nThen there's the guests, they wander your park with a blank facial expression urinating and puking all over the place or shuffling forward like zombies clutching their arm as if it's broken to indicate they're hungry. You'll spend half your time building janitorial buildings in order to try and keep up with the job of cleaning up the never ending stream of bodily fluids polluting your pathways.\n\nThen there's the horrible optimisation of the game, this will bring even the most powerhouse PC to a crawl as soon as you get more than a few thousand guests in your park, all this with graphics that look like they belong in 2006.\n\nI'm sure you're all dying to tell me how it's Early Access and it'll get better but please don't waste your time doing so. This game was advertised as 6 short weeks from full release back when they ran their first "beta" weekend at the end of October 2015 and Atari/Nvizzio demonstrated that they had fixed the problems with the coaster editor (the cause for the delay to early 2016) in a live Stream in December 2015 so if that was the only hold up why after an additional 3 months have they gone backwards and released it as Early Access?\n\nDue to the fact that Atari have been living hand to mouth since emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in December 2013 and have likely sunk a fortune into this over the last 2 years having 3 separate developers (one of which sued Atari for breach of contract and accepted a settlement out of court[www.pacermonitor.com]) and the terrible first impression that this game has made since it's release to Early Access, the chances of this game even recouping it's costs are slim to none. Knowing this and looking back at Atari's most recent abandoned games (Alone In the Dark: Illumination, Haunted House: Cryptic Graves & Asteroids: Outpost) it's hard to see why Atari would continue to support this game any more than they have any of these other abandoned projects.\n\nBuy this game at your peril, it's unlikely to ever fulfil that long list of promised features and leave Early Access. I will actually be highly surprised if Atari keep Nvizzio on the payroll any longer than the next 3 months before they pull all funding and abandon this game too.","April 11","false","1.4"," 55 of 99 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","55","99","5","2"

Looks like they got the horror theme right at least!\n- The non roller coasters rides are not only very few but look worse than the ones on RCT3. The way peeps act while on some of them is completely unnatural and it just hurts so much looking at it.\n- Unless I missed something, there is only ONE song that can be played for all the rides. They give you the option to change it depending on the theme but essentially, it is the same song just slightly different! And if you have 2 rides next to each other and play the music on both, the music is not synchronised and I let you imagine what it sounds like!\n- Even when I got frustrated and tried to be nasty with my peeps this would not work! The peep picking tool does not work, taking one and putting them at the opposite part of the park teleports them back to their original place after a few seconds, peeps in cars that are ejected from the coaster will be teleported to the exit, and drowning peeps (Yes, I was very annoyed at this point!) by adding water does not work, they either keep walking underwater or may eventually stop moving and start "jumping" in the water indefinitely.\n\nA few extras:\n-Most park management options from RCT3 are gone.\n-Peeps disappearing, flying, going through walls, queuing the wrong way.\n-Female peeps (even male?) make porn sounds.\n-Sounds of babies crying all the time or children sounding like they are being tortured.\n-Background decors unfinished.\n\nI am stopping here but I could add more, and that is after having played the game only 2 hours!\n\nBut I know what some of you may want to say: "it's normal it's an early access!"\nWell, before you go any further, here is a thing: Atari had planned to release the game early 2015, and after being postponed multiple times, we got to play the beta in November 2015. More than 4 months later, I cannot see ANY improvement whatsoever that has been made. (I actually think it is even worse as during the beta we did not get the chance to see the monstrosity that are the peeps as they were only "ghosts" back then.)\n\nAtari had multiple chances and a lot of time to improve the game but fact is they just did not care so I cannot see how this game will be any better in the future. I requested a refund of the game and advise everyone not to buy this game.\n\nA very disappointed fan.\n\n","March 31","false","4.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Workers hardly ever clean no matter how many janitor stalls you build, You have a park full of sick and trash. And people who seem to be ill, that look like Zombies.\n\nThe visitors just seem to flock to the newest ride, there is no real equilibrium.\nThe Animations and overall quality of the visitors is super poor, if you zoom in its tolerable, although nothing like the quality of Planet coaster, think more "Theme park animation / graphic quality"\nWhat is with the visitors animations? if you zoom in they seem to walk fine, but if you zoom out to the normal distance its as if the FPS drops on just the visitors animations. Looks ugly, seeing the "peeps" lagging. While the rest of the rides animations are fine.\n\nI dont like the themed buildings, it seems half arsed and an after thought. The shops look bad as they are, but you have to have 20 of the same ugly buildings because the "peeps" have a preference of which ugly building they buy from.\n\nThe sounds OMG the Sound design is terrible. Tinny sounding music, constant screaming of children. I had to play on mute. The times I have been to parks, I dont hear screams over the ambient noise, like its the "Hostel" film.\n\nThey clearly have got allot of inspiration from City Skylines ie the path placement, the style of UI, the land system. But have not translated all the quality and charm Skylines has.\n\nThe game just seems to lack depth, I want a research tree. To have goals to unlock the rides / shops i want.I want better Animations on everything but the rides, I want better quality graphics, I want scenery that matches it surroundings so rock formations and things dont look so artificial.\nI want a more in-depth staff system, that I control.\n\nBut after 5 hours of play the thing that is bugging me so much that I have to stop is the buggy visitor animations / AI / quality.\nI dont feel like spending hours building something awesome, to watch these freaks walk around my sick/trash/zombie filled park.\n\nI like the Coaster system, I like the variety or scenery. I like the terrain tools, I like the pathing system and the UI although it lacks depth.\n\nYou say you went the EA route not to add polish but to add more "functionality" The game needs WAY MORE polish. This does not look like a game released in 2016.\nThe core is there and some of the systems are in place although they lack allot of depth.\nI pre-ordered so long ago, I really wish you had not of released it in this state, even as EA.\nYou only get 1 real launch and first impressions mean everything. Im unsure whether to refund this or not.\n\nI im such a fan of this series even after pre-ordering so long ago and let down after let down. Everything I stated is meant for constructive purposes, not as hate or any other BS.

To be honest, for a game that was to be complete by this point in time, only to be shunned into Early Access again, and to be as buggy as can be - I don't think this merits spending the $20 that I did (I bought this game through a CD key on a different website, so I cannot refund the game, but hey, it was $20). If you are planning on spending $50 on the game at this time, please don't. It's not worth it. $20 is pushing it at the time - I know there is the opportinuty for this game to get better, and if it does, I will go back and I will change my review.\n\nOn a more positive note, the game is very stable - I don't think it is quite as efficient as it could be, but again, that is an expectation for an Early Access game. I think to be fair, that is something that will get better over time. I had no issues with the game crashing or anything like that - it was laggy until I adjusted graphics settings, but overall it was fine.

But honestly now I feel its gone into the wrong hands. I really think I know where it went wrong, Atari. The game was originally created by one man, then in 2 Frontier came in to make it even better, In 3 it was still great when Atari came in, but when Atari seized power all was lost. Atari made some good games, unfortunately Rollercoaster sims are not their thing. I don't want Atari to feel horrible or like it is a lost cause, because quite frankly some people are still going to enjoy it and some have already bought it, but this project is going to lose them money. I played through a friend, and thought it was fun, but when I saw gameplay for PlanetCoaster my experience was over taken just watching the video. Here is the fact Frontier knows what they are doing, they are making PlanetCoaster, and they therefore changed the name of the true RCT. I think in all fairness your money is better spent there. If you aren't a mechanics freak like me and most others though you'll still enjoy RCT. I am not reccomending the game however, because it hasn't met my criteria.

Requested refund and am going to wait for Planet Coaster - which shows so much more promise.\n\nCities: Skylines turned out to be what most people were hoping for in the last SimCity.

What i do not however can live with and support is a broken game where it´s not just the above that is the problem, its also animation, core gameplay elements like guests actually going to a store, guests that run around like headless chickens because the queue is not long enough, pathways that are just poor. not to mention ridecams that made me look at the date just to make sure i was not actually back in the 90´s.\n\nThese things was even in a old Rollercoaster tycoon 3 but it seems that the developers have forgotten that we are writing 2016 and not 1996.\n\nSo can i recommend this?, not a chance in fact STAY FAR FAR FAR FAR AWAY. Unless they change their game drastically this is a failiure.","April 1","false","0.4"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

For the game to be delayed 3 times and end up being early access.... Who wouldn't be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about that? The game is for sure not finished and doesn't run very smooth, but it has a lot of potential to be a good game. If the developers actually use the early access to perfect the game, then yes, I will recommend it. If the game gets stuck in early access and never goes anywhere, then there will be a lot of angry RCT fans.\n\nLast, the game doesn't have much content at all. I really hope they double if not triple the amount of content in the game. To charge 50$ for this game is kind of a joke. Let's just say the additional content/DLC better be free for game owners.\n\nFor now I'm going to give it a thumbs down, but I will quickly change it to a thumbs up if I see the developers are actually making progress.\n","April 1","false","2.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

They're pretty crappy actually and the first-person camera hasn't worked on many of the rides.  Also, the path construction is terrible.

I will not compare this game to any other like game currently on the market "for fairness", with that said..\n\nThis game was something like a job I got as a teenager, it looks so much better on paper than it did in real life. Somehow it just doesn't seem as fun as all the prior installations and I have played RCT 1-3 (and all the add-ons loopy landscapes, corkscrew follies et al), today there is a sort of vibe, nay, passion missing in RCT.\n\nPro's:\nMy PC didn't crash\nThings are a hint more attractive\nThere is more detail (like a mop bucket behind the janitors station for example) oooh\nPeeps have no character, groups etc..\nThe parking lot adds realism\nI like the park and rides management system\nCute ride and shop names\nCurved paths nice path details\nLots of plants options\nBenches and lighting can be off the paths\n\nCons:\nI spent the money\nMore puke than ever - "look a lamp-post" - bleeegh\nDon't know why the game just seems flat - lifeless.\nNothing really snapped to a grid as I expected\nI put in nice dining I had zero popularity though I had 600 peeps visit it they must be just reading the menu's\nPaths are a pain - period\nDecor construction tools was limited - walls etc..\nDeleting: ever tiny bunch of green and tiny little pebble to put in a ride was just silly.\nDeleting: select a ride and it's so easy to select another ride nearby\nIf there is enough negative feedback - this might be all we get folks.\n\nMy guess is they had to rush this out to avoid refunds (tough to account for behind the scenes). Seems like someone is spread too thin to have made this right the first time (I feel bad them and wish them luck). This game could have been very profitable if the right internal resources were dedicated to it.\n\nIf the game is ever finished I'll give it another go but have no plans on participating in early access forums. If this game were $15.99 and I'd give it a thumbs up for value. I think this game is simply OK, I give them a thumbs to the marketing team for getting good revenue.

Overall I think that the graphics have progressed really well from the previous game, however I was a little dissapointed when going on the camera view to play on the ride to find that the graphics were very much the same as rct3. Another issue I seem to be having is that due to my unsuccesful building of a path i'm having to delete an awful lot, this however came with yet more difficulty as the demolish cursor wouldnt snap right to the path. Having not gone any further into the game I am unaware as to what other issues may occur but I am sure there is plenty, if it was possible for me to return this game and get a refund then I certainly would be doing!","April 1","false","22.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This goes especially to those players intending to do super-basic stuff like building basic rides, planting basic scenery, do minimal to no landscaping, etc.\n\nBut when a game has so many glitches, so much lag, and so many errors and incomplete aspects within it, you have to sit and wonder who's bright idea it was to release this horrifically broken piece of software at the price of a full-fledged, fully-built, fully-complete-and-ready-to-sell-to-the-masses video game. I understand the game is listed as "Early Alpha," so this should be expected, but coming from a video game that was originally intended to be released summer of last year, I was at least hoping for it to be polished enough for more serious gameplay.\n\nI found the game okay to play at first and that the reviews many YouTube gamers were giving it to be just a tad bit exaggerated. But do heed their words, and do heed the words of the "Mostly Negative" reviews found on the Steam Page. In the end, it's really not worth it.\n\nI intend to keep my copy to play at another date and hope that they will improve it over time, but it will likely gather dust now and then until I feel ready to suffer through the tremendous lag and superabundant number of peeps puking for my generic janitors to clean.

This game has EXTREMELY high potential to be good, but at the current moment, it looks like it's shaping up to be the "Sims 4" of the RollerCoaster Tycoon series. What I mean by this is that even though they added some of the most commonly requested features by fans, they stripped away a LOT of features in the process. And I don't mean simple features, like a scenery item or to. I mean actual USEFUL features, like the ability to build underground, or the ability to assign staff members to areas. And there aren't too many added features either.\n\nNow keep in mind, this IS an early-access game, so the game has potential to change. However, also keep in mind, the actual finished game was supposed to be released right around now, and this is what we would’ve gotten.\n\nPros:\n-Graphics: Some people say the graphics looked dated. I think they aren't spectacular, but a heck of a lot better than RCT 3.\n-Path creation: A lot more intuitive in this game.\n-The game camera: It actually works, and works well. RCT 3 had probably the most clunky camera system out of any game I've ever played. This game doesn't.\n\nCons:\n-Coaster creator: I like the idea behind the current build, but the controls are clunky, and a result, this tool simply doesn't work that well.\n-The peeps: They're robots. They don't make screams when riding roller coasters, for example.\n-Limit for staff options: You can't assign staff members patrol areas anymore, for instance.\n-Rides and scenery are limiting: Here comes the future DLC\n-Included parks are sparse: Three are included from what I can tell. Yes. Three.\n-Not that many new features: For a game that was made almost 12 years after the last game in the series, you would think there would be more new features. But there isn't.\n\nI'd wait out for this game to come out of early-access, to be honest. There's almost nothing in this game that you can't do in some shape or fashion in the original three games. I've been a pretty loyal RollerCoaster Tycoon fan since the original game, and this game simply isn't ready, isn't innovative and not worth the 50 dollar price tag. Planet Coaster, made by the same studio that made RCT 3, is also coming out this year, so we'll see which one is ultimately better soon.\n","March 31","false","2.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/netpants/recommended/282560/","netpants","NeT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/netpants/","208 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI really really wanted to like this game, and now after playing the PlanetCoaster alpha early release I may be a bit clouded but this game lacks improvement, and growth after such a long time of un-comparable theme park sim/roller coaster park simulations. You know you have problems when a really early PlanetCoaster build is far more polished and feature rich than RollerCoaster Tycoon Worlds beta early build.\n\nAll of the comments and opinions I have are with me knowing that yes it is an early access/release. Although I know this, it really isn't an excuse considering we have passed the original full game release date, and second full game release date.\n\nRollerCoaster Tycoon World severely lacks customization, and depth. Everything about it seems dull, and dumb (not like this game is dumb, but nothing in it seems smart, guests, employees, rides, etc). Everything just seems like its moving a long a set path with no real logic or process to give it a unique feel. Guests still hover around as if they are on an inviseable hovercraft, they are generic, and not very creative. There is no joy in the guests eyes, just walking "sticks".\n\nThe rides look quite a bit better than the previous incarnation of RCT, but still lack a bit of a real feel, and detail. It is almost like they took what made the rides tick in RCT3, and threw a new graphic on them. IN theme parks/amusement parks some rides in a park will be the same ole spin and go up and down, but other rides do not necessarily have a pattern to them. I may be splitting hairs here, but after so many years what did you bring us that was new and imaginative? Not much.\n\nObjects, paths and scenary are a pain in the butt to use. Paths are finicky on where they can connect to each other, and you will find sceneary won't attach in that one special spot you saved open just for that particular piece of scenary. Unless you are a master of the poorly implemented way to use the paths tool, or plop sceneary expect to be spending a lot of time deleting things, replacing paths, and starting over on parts of the park if you are a detail oriented person.\n\nI could go on for awhile, but I will just say this.\n\nThe game lacks depth, and ties you up in regards to creativity, and customization. If you are happy with just throwing down rides, making money on peeps, and cleaning up garbage, then you may not think this is to bad of a game, but to be honest there are better games that are 12+ years older than this one that will give you that experience. I don't feel like I wasted my money as I still hope the devs put it into high gear and turn this franchise around, but it is really looking bleak at this point. They have a whole heck of a lot of work ahead and them if they want this franchise to survive. I have a feeling though they pretty much just killed it. The new champions of the theme park tycoon series I have a feeling isn't going to be Atari.","April 4","false","4.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The frame rate drops are ridiculous and it lags so bad once you get 2000+ guests in your park. It has a terrible game breaking bug that causes your mechanics and staff to get stuck at the exit of a ride when trying to repair it - or they get stuck trying to leave their building... so guess what! nothing can get fixed and your park becomes a horrible disaster that servers nothing but food and overpriced toilet use. You can pick them up, but then they teleport back to the spot they were stuck in. Also any roller coaster you have causes EVERY single person to puke when they get off... yes EVERY SINGLE ONE. So your guests are never happy when leaving a ride (after puking themselves) and walking through a mountain of every other persons vomit in the park.

It still is nowhere near release. You can't edit hardly anything on the pre-built rides, coasters, and structures. The peep graphics are choppy at any eye height beyond right over top of them. The coaster building interface is junk - it lets you build ridiculous track segments while defying logic and sense. The graphics are poor - RCT3 was better. The on ride cameras are choppy when turning or changing slope - very poor. You can't see the ride increase or decrease speed either, it always looks like it's going the same speed. The building system overall is bad, clunky, impossible to place things where you want them. The game is so far from ready, and there doesn't seem to be any promising sign that it's going to get any better. This is all coming from a very disappointed, huge RCT fan from day 1.

I've been patient, given Atari plenty of leniency after reading all of their blog posts, and I actually bought the game expecting to get something that's at least enjoyable to play. (Luckily I got it for $30AU elsewhere)\n\nSadly, that is not the case. After months of broken promises of the full release of the game, we get this steaming hot mess in Early Access instead. And it's not fun.\n\nThe peeps look horrendous and the animations are all awkward, and there are quite a few instances where staff will appear to glide across the map. When you scroll out completely the peeps look like pixels moving jaggedly.\n\nThe coaster builder, while innovative, is really not that pleasant to work with. While I enjoy being offered more flexibility in building a roller coaster, I still have a very hard time getting the pieces to work just how I want them to, and it doesn't integrate well with the piece-by-piece builder - which, by the way, doesn't have the option to place pre-built banked curves. Moreover, there's no way to change the speed of a whole section of chain lift at the same time - Why isn't this feature present here when it was present in all previous RCT games.\n\nThe stalls are oversized, the transition from individual staff to staff-rooms is terrible, the path system, while innovate, also lacks from terrible implementation and lack of piece-by-piece building, the rides look tacky, blah blah blah...\n\nI could go on for ages, but to sum it up, it's...not fun to play at all. I'm not vibing it like I did with the first 3 installments, and I honestly would have faith in this game, but considering the amount of times Atari's been blowing smoke up our ♥♥♥, I can't give credit to anything they say anymore. AAA game my ♥♥♥, Mattlab.\n\nI could only justify buying the game if it was $10, but that's stretching it. Don't waste your time on this game right now. If you have a real itch to immerse yourself in a beautiful theme park sim, fork out the extra money for Planet Coaster.","April 1","false","2.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It is awful in every element of the "game". Sure this is Early Access but that is NO excuse for this horrible "game". This has been a failing project for years. The current screenshots all look good but then you get in the "game" (which is just over 1gb) and put all the settings on high, you still get something that looks worse than RCT 3 does and that game is 10 years old! Artai has been money hungry for years turning well known IP's into new, totally garbage games and RCTW is no different.\n\nA few things wrong with it:\n\n-Sound design (want to hear some adults only bedroom noises? Zoom into the coaster stations)\n-UI (everything is just wrong. Not user friendly, way to big, hard to navigate, etc)\n-Peeps are a joke. You will find quite a few that look the same. They don't walk right. Loading into rides is awful\n-Gameplay is just horrid. I had to force myself to play for an hour trying to find something good about it and there is nothing.\n-Graphics are awful\n-Just no fun at all\n\nAs soon as the negative feedback started rolling in on the forums, threads were getting deleted. You mention Planet Coaster on the forums (even when trying to compare the games to give Atari ideas), you get the whole thread deleted. Atari has become a massive joke and I will never buy another game from them again. It's a real shame that they have the rights to Roller Coaster Tycoon because I would love to see what a real game development company could do with this beloved series.

For me, it has recreated the old 'Rollercoaster Tycoon' games but just removed the fun.\n\nPros:\n\n- Despite what some people say, the rollercoaster builder is actually quite nice to use and I was able to create some good designs with it.\n- The ride cameras can sometimes be fun (if the framerate keeps up enough!)\n\nCons (Where do I even start?):\n\n- Such a simple task of building paths is such a pain.. the game is so fussy about what connects where, and even with grid and snapping, I was unable to create a simple straight path system\n- The ride a building placement is equally as unpredictable, refusing to allow buildings to be placed in open areas next to paths, also not automatically joining to a path when placed directly next to one.\n- The staffing system has been 'dumbed down' and the janitors walk off and do what they want. You find yourself constantly building new staff buildings as the staff have seemingly disappeared and I cannot find a way to track them individually.\n- There is little to no customization on certain rides (especially pre-built ones).. Again, this removes a large portion of the fun.\n- The game seems to include food and souvineer stands from 4 set themes, limiting your creativity.\n- Only 3 maps that you can start from scratch on.\n- No autosave feature, so I lost over an hours work due to a power cut. In 2016 I would have thought this would be a standard feature?\n\n- Now for probably the biggest con.. graphics and performance... For a game that was supposedly meant to be 'retail ready' by December 2015, its appauling. The graphics look like a mobile phone game, or a PC game from 2004. Also the performance on highest settings is really bad. On my GTX 970, I can get around 30-40fps scrolling round my park. When I zoom in to watch the customers glitch around the footpaths and disappear into rides, however, i get as low as 15fps. The framerate is also very unpredictable when using the ride cams.\n\nI could go on and on about how I am disappointed by this game, but I'll cut the review here. I was looking forward to this so much last year that I didnt cancel my pre-order when I heard about the beta. I also eagerly downloaded it the minute I saw it was avaliable. I tried to enjoy the game and ignored the criticism, but all it did was make me want to play 'Rollercoaster Tycoon 2'!\n","April 6","false","8.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","1"

If anything, this is what they should have started with. While all the features are there, even more bugs are present. Paths to not work properly, peeps look awful, the camera feels worse than a classic N64 camera. Not to mention, the parks are SO SMALL. All of the premade coasters aren't very interesting and also quite small. You may be lucky to get 2 coasters in the same park.\n\nCoaster builder again, while much much better, is still a disaster, and the camera doesn't make trying to build exactly the way you want it any easier. Placing a premade track piece, and then going into freeform mode causes the previous piece to deform and angle awkwardly. Nothing is very streamlined at this point.\n\nI have not tried anything else other than placing a few flat rides and staff buildings (another thing that shouldn't have been included, as it takes up already insufficient space); because the game crashed when trying to change the options.\n\nThis game needs at LEAST another 8 months in development to get everything sorted out, and done right.\n\nAs many have already said, Planet Coaster is already 1000x what this is looking to be. I hate to be one to compare between two different games, but it's really true. If you want a good Theme Park simulator, or even just want to be able to build cool, interesting (not to mention large) coasters, RCTW is not for you. Hats off to Nvizzio for trying, but you've missed the mark for a second time.\n\nCheers everyone, see you in Planet Coaster","March 30","false","6.6"," 20 of 34 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","20","34","0","1"

The graphics are pretty awesome.\n\nI like some of the news things they have put into this game but it still is nothing like the original. Which to me this is a good and bad thing. It is great that we have so much more customization to this game. Circle paths, large, small, medium paths, lights, trash cans, benches, etc.\n\nI enjoy the fact that you can make a roller coaster now almost as you wish and it is not constrained as it was in the old Roller Coaster Tycoon. But with that being said, the magic of the old games is not completely present here.\n\nI want to build a roller-caster, test, add my scenery, my queue and be off. I don't want to spend almost 2 hours on building a coaster and than not be able to finish it because my train car is always hitting a bar that was placed in the wrong area by the game. I don't want to spend close to an hour and a half just to complete laying out my track. I want to put able to select the section of the track and place it how I like. There are alot of advantages to this new UI and I do recognize them but I am not a roller coaster designer. I am a average player that wants to build a roller coaster in the game as quickly and have it enjoyable. At the point, it is not that enjoyable to build a roller coaster because it is super frustrating.\n\nHere is an example on why it is so frustrating, If I am building my roller coaster and I am zoomed out to see what it looks like. If I click on a portion of the map where i would like for my track to be laid, that game from now where lays a very large piece of track randomly that the end of the new piece of track is laid down all the way to the edge of the park. WHAT?!!!!! That is not what I wanted. Now I have to zoom back in to make the track smaller, than angle the camera just right, and than either shift and any of the 4 number to adjust the track as I want. That is just ridiculous.\n\nIf you are going to show a grid, as I like building on a grid, don't give me just a small piece of grid. Just display it on the whole map.\n\nFor sure there is a learning curve for this game. But so far my initial review of this game is not all the stellar when building coaster. This is something that is NOT going to change for this is pretty much the hole core of the game.\n\nI am still at a maybe..... I wouldn't recommend this game but at the same time if you are a die hard fan as I am, I wouldn't turn you away either.","November 2, 2015","false","3.7"," 56 of 103 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","56","103","4","0"

On one hand this game is (head scratchingly) in early access. On the other hand, they've had multiple games in the series to pull from in terms of content and roadmapping as well as several delays before the official release date. As an early access game, it's not bad. It's completely playable with the money and simulation basics in there to actually run a park.\n\nHowever, as an RCT game it is a major letdown. We were promised an evolution in the series and what's here is simply the framework for the next step. Is that a bad thing? Not exactly, if something isn't broke then don't fix it. But it's nowhere near what Planet Coaster is doing. Right now you have 3 themes and over half of the scenery/props are locked. I'm not sure if they are locked behind some sort of in-game system or locked out because they aren't finished yet... the game doesn't say. My park ran smoothly enough for me but after I had built 3 coasters and 8 flat rides, I had 1,300 peeps in my park. At one point my menu disappeared so I had to exit out and reload from the main menu. After it sluggishly reloaded, the framerate was in the single digits. Making it unplayable in my eyes.\n\nAs for the coaster builder, I didn't care for it much at first. I made a clunky and ugly first coaster. The second was a bit better and the third was almost exactly what I wanted. It's not a bad system and I actually think it works great once you learn how to use it. You can attach set pieces, just like in the older RCT games, or you can go off the grid and make whatever you want! You just have to play with it. So, the coaster builder is on the short list of positives for this game.\n\nThe biggest problems I see right now is the amount of content, lack of in depth management tools (staff management, etc.), ugly peeps, and poor optimization. Luckily these are things that can be addressed and fixed. The menus aren't particularly eye pleasing but that's not a big deal.\n\nAlso, the mission objectives that are given to you in game are so HUGE they sometimes occupy 75% of the screen so you can't look at the tasks while playing with your park. You have to look at them, close it out, try to finish the task, then open it back up to see the next one. It's mind bogglingly annoying!\n\nThe truth is that there is a lot of potential here but right now it's not worth the asking price. Wait for a sale or the full version to see if they can polish this up a bit.","March 30","false","9.7"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Remembering though that it is EARLY ACCESS - but also remembering that they were going to release the game about now as 'finished'.\n\nDefinitly not a finished game. Graphic issues everywhere. Glitchy and lots of clipping around the place. Peeps tend to hover and not walk about. Staff members do the same. Paths clip. The on-coaster Cam needs a fair bit of work - there is no detail in the coaster, but the scenery is good looking a far.\n\nThe ambience is a bit quiet or sterile so far. It seems pretty dull for a theme park, even with a few hundred people in. You dont hear the hum of people, just the random moans and screams of some ladies - which sounds like pornography tbh. And lots of money cha-ching noises from your rides. I was expecting a bit more immersion and realism.\n\nAt this stage I'm on the fence. Im not excited but it has some potential. I am considering a refund and trying Planet Coaster Alpha instead - it looks more polished.\n\nI would give it probably a 5.5 to a 6/10 in its current state, but I will give it more of a go over the next few days and update. My advice though... is to wait. The Atari team could turn this around and make it into something great.\n\n*UPDATE* I gave this game a really good go and played for a few hours and have decided on requesting a refund. Already I feel I have played enough and done everything. It doesnt feel like an RCT game - theres no atmosphere. The coaster builder and camera is also horrible and VERY hard to use. 3hrs into the game and I dont feel like playing anymore - now you all know thats not right - not to mention my fingers are sore from clicking (the bulldose system sucks too).\n\nI may consider re-purchasing down the track if there are some significant improvements, but until then, the Planet Coaster Alpha actually looks a lot better than this is in its current state, so Id suggest at least taking a peek at that.\n\nThe best way to describe it is: RCTW = SimCity 5 (a major let down).

However after the launch I got curious and re-purchased the game and here is what I think....\n\nNVIZZIO HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO!!!!\n\nPro's:\nWell it feels like it tries to be RCT\nArea themes are good\n\nand well in my opinion that's about it for pro's\n\nCons:\nTHE COASTER BUILDER IS A LOAD OF BULL - How did you screw this up??? Press 1 and scroll mouse wheel to raise and lower, press 2 and scroll mouse wheel to tilt, press 3 and scroll mouse wheel to pitch and pressing 4 and you guessed it scroll that mouse wheel and it does something else. This is the WORST coaster builder I have used, its just so clunky and time consuming compared to, dare I say it, Planet Coaster's which they hid in Beta due to they thought it wasn't great but let me tell you it is the quickest precise builder I have used. It systems don't fully work, I struggled to get two trains running on one track, it kept failing with no information on how to fix it, the coaster preview while building is clunky, you click to build and then the preview of the next piece dissapears, it only reappears once you click and then click to build again. It's just pretty much, in my opinion, the worst coaster builder I have ever used.\n\nTHE RIDES - Okay I get it realism is in but they just don't feel real and oh no the signs, the terrible ride signs. Yes you can rename and it shows up on the sign but there is just no character to them. It feels robotic and no this wasn't a sci fi theme.\n\nTHE GRAPHICS - Just no, this is not 2016 worthy level of graphics, I can see that maybe you were trying to capture the feel of RCT3, or it's just an "optimization" thing but seriously that's why the game was delayed and it STILL SUCKS.\n\n\nThis game could have been great, COULD HAVE BEEN, but competition in the market from Planet Coaster and even Parkitecht did not do this game well. I mean Planet Coaster literally beats it on every level, yes it has flaws but that's what development time is for, RCTW HAS HAD 3 F***ING YEARS TO GET THIS RIGHT AND 3 DEVELOPERS. Seriously get this game to the high standard it now has to live up to or congrats to Nvizzio for killing off one of the most beloved franchises of Theme Park building.","March 31","false","4.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

At this moment it's really an early access.\nThere are really some good things about the game, the way you can design you're own rollercoasters looks good and is fun to play with. The paths are a lot better than in RTC3, you kan now make corners and lay them down as you like them, make them bigger or smaller.\nIt works and looks OK, but it does not make me really excited about the game yet.\n\nThe controls are really bad. Most is done through the keyboard, it works but the right combination of mouse and keyboard makes it really easy to control.\nThe mouse controls you have like zooming in with the scroll wheal is way to sensitive.\nWhen giving it a single little scroll it goes all the way down or up. Maybe it's a setting, but I would expect this to work like it should with basic settings. I have found the side screen scrolling with the mouse, so that makes it somewhat better, but overall the controls are really not great yet.\n\nThe graphics are not great, it looks OK, but it's not the graphics you expect from a game today. Beside that it the graphical performance is not so good. Lot's of frame rate drops.\n\nPeeps are sometimes walking of the paths trough bushes and trees and some look like there are floating over the path.\n\nSounds are missing from peeps when you ride allong. Sometimes when you ride allong with a rollercoaster you keep hearing the lift chain all the way in the ride.\n\nBut at the other hand I think this game can have a lot of potential, but it does have a long way to go.\nIf they make the graphics better and put some time in bug fixing, better controls and some more content and senarios to play it really can be a nice game to play.\n\nI would not recommend the game yet at this moment, the main reason for this is especially the price and what you get for it at the moment.\nOn the other hand, if they will really make the game a lot better to play in the upcomming months with more content and features without extra costs the price is acceptable, but that's is something you will only know in time.\n\n","March 31","false","5.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Give us an option for the camera NOT to follow the track additions.  Every time I chnage a track peice, size, lenght, etc. the camera moves me farther away (usually up) which makes finishing a coaster very frustrating.  I've managed to play for about 3 hours and in my last session finally copmpleted a custom coaster - several times before I gave up & quit the game.\n\nSecond, keep fixing bugs.  Once I finally completed my first custom coaster the trains crashed off the track in a straight spot of track.  No reason for the coaster to fail????  I quit the game after that...\n\nThird and final rant for now - we need an option to sync same selected option across stalls.  This was added to previous versions of RCT because it just makes sense.  Its no fun clicking on each & every stall to chnage a setting (turn music on) or adjust a price.\n\nI understand this is "Early Access" and it is a shame that this is used as a tool to ship incomplete product to the consumer.

I don't like how you can't delete trees or scenery just by left clicking while building rides.  Also, trees and scenery aren't automatically deleted when placing track like it used too which makes it difficult to build.  When building roller coasters it will say invalid location and it isn't very clear why it is an invalid location.  Is it because it is too high?  Or are there trees/scenery in the way?  The bulldozer tool is also very hard to use.  It's hard to delete small objects.  I find myself clicking on items 10 times before it actually deletes.  This game honestly is a pain to play.  The new track building tools are cool but not very easy to use.  This game needs a lot of work.","June 5","false","3.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/metaphysicaldissonance/recommended/282560/","metaphysicaldissonance","X44","http://steamcommunity.com/id/metaphysicaldissonance/","69 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMost of the negative reviews of this game are completely unwarranted. I've been a fan of this franchise since the very first game, and this has the potential to be the best one yet, even though it does need a lot of work. Most of the people who seem to hate it either seem to ignore the fact that it's an incomplete early release, or simply didn't have the patience to actually learn how to play it. Finally, I think it does measure up to it's main competitor, Planet Coaster.\n\nFirst, let me say that if you're expecting an easy-to-play, piece-by-piece builder like the previous two where everything always comes out perfectly square and symmetrical with complete ease, you're going to be disappointed. The node-based coaster builder can be tricky, and it takes some work to get parallel tracks or symmetrical scenery arrangements. However, most of the people complaining about this seem to have completely ignored the snap and grid options. Once you learn to use it, I actually find these elements superior to analogous elements in other simulators like Cities:Skylines. It does take a while to learn to and optimize the path building, scenary placement, and coaster-building features, and it's a bit more difficult to use, but the trade off in difficulty pays off with the high level of freedom you have.\n\nNow, something very negative about this game, it is EXTREMELY buggy in its current state. It crashes a lot, the frame rate is really low, a number of the features (such as the coaster's physics engine) are woefully incomplete, and the AI in guests and maintainence needs a lot of work, but it is important to remember this is an incomplete game. It's probably more buggy than most games that are called beta or early access, but that's more the fault of Atari's marketing than the game itself. If they work out these bugs, it has the potential to be a really good game.\n\nThe best feature of the game by far is the coaster builder. Judging by other comments and You Tube videos, most of the people complaining about it seem to have absolutely no clue what they are doing and haven't even tried to learn how to use it. It is in my opinion the best coaster builder out there right now. It's less complex than No Limits, and gives you way more freedom than the builders in the first three or the current version of Planet Coaster. Granted, the physics engine is probably incomplete and what's right now there is probably a place holder (there's very little friction on coasters, the breaks are way to powerful) and there are some bugs with the coaster builder (frame rate slows way down, some features cause it to crash, and there are a number of bugs with the breaks). It's also somewhat difficult to learn how to use (though should come somewhat naturally to those familiar with No Limits), but again what you lose in easiness pays off in what you gain in freedom. Again, don't expect an easy piece-by-piece builder, but do expect to be able to build really realistic coasters. I love the mixture of node and piece-by-piece builders.\n\nSince I also have access to the early bird version of Planet Coaster, I think it's worth doing a point-by-point comparison between the two. Granted, both games are incomplete, so all of this is subject to change, but it's worth mentioning how I think the two stack up against each other.\n\nSo far, here's what's better about RCTW:\n-Better Coaster Builder with way more freedom than you have in PC, but PC's builder isn't even in alpha yet so this can change.\n-Better path builder. PC's path builder is easily the worst part of the game, it's so wonky and very difficult to build decent looking paths.\n-UGC. As someone who spent hours looking for and working with CS in RCT3, this is a huge plus. The integration with Steam Workshop is great, and it allows to add elements of piece-by-piece building in RCTW that aren't there yet. Also, it expands the potential for customization in the game in the future way out there.\n-Better looking flat rides.\n-Better camera controls. Though PC has very similar controls to RCT3, RCTW's controls are more intuitive and don't clash with other controls in the game.\n\nHere's what's better about PC:\n-Better overall graphics. Even though some elements in RCTW are more detailed, the lighting, shadows, and such in PC are way superior.\n-Better sounds. Sounds like guests on coasters are having sex in RCTW, and coaster sounds in PC are more realistic. Also, it sounds a lot less cluttered.\n-Better Scenery builder. Piece-by-piece building allows for a lot more freedom in building buildings and the scenery in general looks better.\n-Better AI. Peeps act and move more naturally, and there are fewer bugs. It gets you to think about the layout of your park a lot more.\n-Way less buggy, and better optomized overall.\n\nHere's what's neutral/debatable between the two:\n-Stalls. The Stalls in RCTW are more realistic, and the feature of walk-in resteraunts is a huge plus. But, the stalls in PC are more customizable.\n\n-Coster stations. Like stalls, they're more realistic in RCTW, but more customizable in PC. Granted, RCTW's devs said they're planning on allowing for blank coaster stations for mor customizations in future updates.\n\n-RCTW has more features, game modes, and such as of now but that's just where it is in its development.\n\nOverall, I slightly prefer RCTW but that's mainly because the main reason I've ever played these games is for coaster building and, as it stands now, RCTW has more features overall, but PC just needs to catch up in development. Both have the potential to be great games.\n\nIn conclusion, do not by this game if you're looking for a completely ready-to-play, fully optimized, and easy-to-play game. It still needs a lot of work, and is difficult to learn to master all the controls. Most of the reason why people seem to hate it is a mixture of bad marketing and unrealistic expectations of how complete it would be. For casual gamers new to the genre of theme park simulators, it's definitely not worth the price. But if you truly love simulation games, and have the patience to work through the bugs and actually learn how to play, and want to support the development of a potentially good game, it's definitely worth it.","April 4","true","55.0"," 113 of 214 people (53%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","53","113","214","9","6"

Lots of framerate drops too for seemingly no reason. I see no difference in the gameplay mechanics, the grid facility is pointless as it doesn't match up with anything, they say they completely overhauled the coaster builder since the beta. Well again i see no difference in the coaster builder now compared to the beta, it's really not good, it's incredibly difficuilt to get any smooth turns/curves/corners. Alot of placements of objects, scenery, paths etc. aren't 'allowed' when there is nothing blocking them from being placed. It's just frustrating, it's all these features that are the most fundamental part of the game and they still just don't work. Everything is just very tedious and frustrating to do, it should be easy! But instead, i feel it's very very poor.\n\nGRAPHICS -\nI wouldn't even go as far to say that they are OK, i understand graphics aren't everything, however after Roller Coaster Tycoon 3's release date of October 26th 2004 the graphics feel like more of a remaster apposed to up to date graphics. It just feels lazy, and it simply doesn't look refreshing or exciting. Nothing new or high tech going on here. Framerate drops all over the place even on low settings, changing graphical settings hasn't seemed to help in any scenario.\n\nCONTENT -\nUnfair to say considering it is now in early access and more content will be released, but don't expect a lot to begin with. There is barely a campaign. There are specific 'scenarios' such as 'Turn a failed park around' which are ok but not exactly a lot of thought put in here either. A sandbox mode which is great to have still so thats a positive!!\n\nFEATURES -\nReally the only noteable new good feature, is the curved paths and having the ability to not be restricted by a grid (however as previously said, neither work as you'd expect) other than that, there isn't a lot of difference. The social hub is a good idea to be able to share creations but i haven't seen it working yet so i can't comment.\n\nOVERALL -\nBringing the franchise back again sounds like a fantastic idea, and what the developers are telling us and raising our hopes for just hasn't happened. Everything feels lazy and sloppy, just as if there is no passion put in anymore. It's such a disappointment, if you are a Roller Coaster Tycoon fan i can't imagine you are going to feel anything but disappointment which i hate to say. Once again, it's early access so there are features yet to come so this is as of now, but considering it has been delayed and now shoved in early access. Things don't look good.","March 31","false","5.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

(the new one) And everything was way to big for the map. Good luck fitting 3 coasters on the same map. No underground coaster can be made. The seperate lines in the rollercoaster line right before you get in. They should have people waiting there already to make it a faster process. Auto deleting trees and terrian would be nice.   I dont like the fact that you cant place food stalls without adding another path to them. I dont like how theres no stairs for steeper path declines. I would much rather just have the old block system with paths. Because when you start curving paths and such it turns into were Tropico and Simcity were so oldly setup. I like the idea of setting up curved paths but it never turns out right. Theres no room on the map for Maintence sheds and cleaning rooms. Get rid of them bring back the old style.I like picking up cleaning guys. And setting them where i want them. And so much more disapointment waiting for you.  I was really looking forward to this game. But now I have a huge sad face.

The paths are so wonky and dont really make sence ( they should let you adjust the angle of the curve better and choose the size). The snapping is horrible. It's so laggy. The coaster builder makes no logical sense with the shift and scroll and it's so hard to make the coaster like you want. There isnt enough scenery things. the fences are so difficult to build. the grid doesnt work so well (should be able to make it much bigger). There isnt enough coasters or rides. Last of all you can't build your own buildings anymore. Worst game I'd rate it a 3/10. They should have just replicated rct3 and boosted the graphics or something and made curved paths because this is pathetic. I hope they fix everything and add features because i'm buying planet coaster otherwiswe.

Yes, they added the familiar piece-by-piece building that we all know form the original games. Which is fine. The spline based coaster builder is a pain in the ♥♥♥. The main issue that I have is that the piece you are forming is attached to the camera. So when I'm building a coaster, have the piece where I want it, and want to check from another angle I can't because the piece will slide along.  Furthermore, I've spend 10 minutes to tweak the brakes in order to make the coaster pass the test. I don't want to spend 10 minutes on tweaking the brakes; in real life if a coaster has it's desired speed it will open the brakes and let the train pass through. The stations are troublesome too as I can't change the length of them. So if I want to have a compact coaster I can't because the station is gicantic. Other strange things will happen to your coaster as well in freeform mode; supports where going straight through the tracks and my axes where inverted at some point so every new piece I placed was all messed up. The experience was just frustrating.\n\n- Realism is not great too. I don't think the developers took any time watching real rides and Roller Coasters, because if they did the game would look completely different. Some rides that are included do not even exist in real life, whereas all of the rides in the previous installments did. Even more, the Roller Coasters look afwul too. They remind me of the toy Coaster Dynamix models, with the supports being constructed by plumbers. I'm a mechanical engineer myself so I know what works and what doesn't. What we're seeing in RCTW doesn't work in real life and that bothers me a lot.\n\n- All rides look more like they belong on a carinval instead of a theme park.\n\n- The lack of water rides. Where are the log flumes, the rapid rivers etc? I mean, come on, those are essential ride in theme parks! Why aren't these in the game?\n\n- The path system is a mess as well. Paths won't connect to the places I want them. In the previous installments you could snap paths together to make a plaza, this isn't possible in this game either. Also the three widthts are way too limited.\n\n- The guests look terrible. Even horror movies are less scarier than these mutants. They can't be drowned as well, but I'm not counting that.\n\nAnd finally, but most important: The game is missing all the charm that the previous installments had. And I think that is the part where this game really dissapoints me most. A utter shame, luckily I can still play the old versions and I will continue to do so as this piece of empty software is not worth both my time and my attention. I was done with this game within half an hour and I believe that says enough.","March 31","false","1.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I have player RCT 1, 2 and 3. And I have been VERY EAGERLY looking forward to RCTW!! I pre-ordered the Deluxe Edition of the game to get the extra bits and pieces and to give some extra funds of support to Atari and Nvizzio. It was a very expensive price for a game but I thought it would be well worth it... I was wrong!\n\nYesterday I got the game, RCTW installed and I launched it, and within the space of ten minutes I was totally deflated by what I saw...\n\nI work in software development. I have used BETA's to get feedback on software from BETA Testers. I have taken part in software BETA's and early access. And yes, the software is buggy and needs a bit of polish, but I am STUNNED that the state RCTW is currently in is what Atari and Nvizzio only recently classed as a nearly finished game that was getting some polish and optimisation. Are you serious!?! REALLY!!!\n\nI know RCTW has gone through some rough patches. It's passed through the hands of a number of developers and I have backed them all. I had real admiration for Nvizzio as I saw the work they were doing and it looked great!! But I can tell you now, the RCTW game I have on my PC right now doesn't look anything like what I saw in the videos and screenshots used to promote this game. I didn't get to play the BETA back in October as I was away, so seeing RCTW today is my first real introduction to it, but what I see in RCTW today looks worse than what I saw of the BETA.\n\nThe graphics seems to have degraded completely! The peeps looks terrible!! There are animation glitches, gameplay glitches, sound glitches, and the game just doesn't grab a hold of you and make you feel good about playing it. There is no soul to the game at all. The whole atmosphere is just wrong, no, it's missing completely!!\n\nIf this was BETA 2, I would have been stunned by the poor quality of it...\nIf this was really early access I would have been stunned by the poor quality of it...\nBut the fact that Atari have said, prior to the "current" early access release, that this game was nearly finished and it was just getting some polish and optimisation for release... WOW!! I can't believe that THIS is what Atari classify as being a polished 2016 PC game.\n\nSo I have a question... What happened...?!? Seriously, what has happened here? How can this version of RCTW that is "nearly finished and receiving some polish and optimisation" look so poor, so bad, and is so buggy and holds very little fun, be considered as good enough for release as a game???\n\nI have to be honest, I have ZERO faith in Atari and Nvizzio that they can bring this game up to a good enough standard to make it the game that it should be! I also am wondering just what have Atari and Nvizzio being doing the past few months when there was silence on the forums??? I was, at the time, hopeful that they were busy making the game great! But I certainly don't see it... I see a very poor game that is nowhere near ready for release and I find it insulting that they classed this as a nearly finished game, receiving some polish and optimisation to get it ready for release.\n\nFor the record, I don't have access to the Planet Coaster ALPHA, I do have the game pre-ordered, but I can tell you now, their ALPHA looks a LOT better than the RCTW nearly ready for release game. I will keep watching to see what Atari and Nvizzio do to save RCTW but I'm not expecting a miracle to happen and that's what needs to happen. Let's be honest, if this is what they class as a game nearly finished and getting polished for release, then it's an utter shambles!","March 31","false","4.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The major thing for me at this stage is the coaster builder, you can do anything with it which is great, but the problem is you can do anything with it and it is so hard to build anything complex or overly quick without it going wrong... you cannot delete multiple pieces of track, you have to select each one, it is pretty much impossible to build one using the track building as per RCT3, this has taken a backwards step IMHO, the people in the game are idiots, they are complaining they are hungry outside a huge selection of food shops and still complain, there is sick everywhere and no janitors ever clean it up, you cannot scale, or amend prebuilt rides or flats, the drop tower should be much higher and you should be able to amend this to suit, no monorail or trains (Yet, hopefully they will come).... I guess the main question should be what has changed since RCT3..... not a huge amount really.. yes the GFX look a bit better and the menus are different but is it really 10 years newer???? I guess the answer is no and unless they sort the coaster builder out so it makes sense and you can do what you want to do then i guess its kind of a backwards step vs RCT and when that came out.... I hope the DEV's can bring this into the 21st century as i want this to be good, but its just a bit lacking in every department.... this is an early release so i am holding out hope but i was hoping and expecting so much more..... PS if anyone can tell me how to do a straight bit of track using the builder then im all ears!","April 4","false","6.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

I was prepared for it to be different to the other RCT games but it's just no good.\n\nThe staff huts don't seem to have proper pathfinding for the staff so I can have a large hut with 10 janitors and the paths are absolutely filthy. I've got about 40 janitors and mechanics in a reasonably small park but rides remain unfixed for absolutely ages and the paths are rammy.\n\nI've set the inspection times to 20 minute intervals, my rides still breakdown all the time and then remain unfixed for ages, even when right next to the mechanic hut.\n\nI can't see any way to easily see what staff I've got and where. I placed a large entertainers hut... 1 month later  (game time obvs!) I saw 2 entertainers leave the building. And there were 6 'employed' apparently but no sign of them months later.\n\nThere's no way that I can see what excitement levels or intensity the rides I'm building have before I actually build them. I don't know whether I'm getting value for money or not as I used to use that information to determine how much I can charge for the ride etc. Also doesn't say how big the ride is going to be until you actually select it.\n\nI was playing the campaign on frolicking forest, deleting trees and shrubs was a frickin nightmare and levelling the ground left me with several rock outcrops that wouldn't flatten so it was a little bit pointless. You should be able to delete trees and bushes by dumping a ride on top of them and all land you own should be able to be flattened easily.\n\nI want to like this game but I don't right now.

This was a key fuction (for me anyway) as a kid to keep my park at top spec, now I am unable to make sure litter and other things is kept off paths as the janitors decide they just don't need to go up a ramp.\n\n\nThe ability to modify/customise pre-built coasters/rides.\n\nAgain, really? What harm would it of caused allowing us to change the colours of thrill rides or stores? My early parks in previous games were all colour coded sections and themes, now I know I can sort of have a theme BUT who says I want my sci-fi section to be blue and blue only?\n\n\nThe graphics are really dated.\n\nThis is another thing I don't quite get, you have the potential to make an amazingly good looking game, yet it looks like RC3 a couple of years later. Then it also seems your optomisation for powerful machines is a bit lacking too, when I put details to very high, I expect more than just block colours.\n\n\nCustom built coasters need some work.\n\nYou build a piece, then you click it to move it, then you add bits, the you tell it to build another piece, then you move it....you are over complicating something that has unlimited potential.\n\n\n\nLike I said, it's not a bad game...it's just not a good game at this stage, yes yes, I know it's in alpha but they have had plenty of time to polish it up more than this...","March 31","false","3.6"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

There's very little of the Early Access build that can be considered robust. The press release for the EA build boasts 4 different themes, and tons of scenery; the '4 different themes' bit is technically correct, but only because they didn't include the word 'complete.'  The 'tons of scenery' boast is an outright fib, unless they were estimating the raw, real-world tonnage of the simulated rock formations and generic foliage that comprise the mass of your 'theming' options.\n\nActual theming options -- statuary, themed plants, facades, animatronics, landscape textures, etc. -- are extremely slim. As a strange contrast, there actually IS a fairly robust selection of fences and path textures, quite possibly more than were available in RCT3, so if you were hinging your plans for a dream park on pavement options, brother, this could be your train.\n\nA building sim lives and dies by its building options, and RCTW just doesn't have them, yet. It's hard to imagine what Atari was hoping to accomplish with this EA build; while this move ostensibly beats Frontier's "Planet Coaster" to the Steam marketplace, the lack of options can only result in unflattering comparisons and bad press.\n\nI remain optimistic that the missing theming options are forthcoming (particularly if they have any hope of properly implementing dark rides, as they've announced), but as it stands right now, they have a long, long road ahead if they desire to catch up to RCT3, and much longer still if they hope to surpass it.\n\nFor now, there's not enough here to justify a purchase.

The reason they give is that they can't pay out money spend so long ago. Wich is a strange reason since in this case buying a long time ago is  one of the main gounds for the refund.

It was the best theme park simulation at the time. RCTW just doesn't feel the same. As awesome as it is that there's no restrictions to building on a snap grid or straight angle, the mechanics of the coaster builder are very flawed. What would take you 10 minutes in RCT3 to build will take you over an hour to build in RCTW. Additionally, RCTW coaster builder is so poor that after you're done, you'll be required to tweak for another 30 minutes, most likely.\n\nAnimations of peeps are incomprehensible. They are extremely cartoonish and stick out like a sore thumb. Staff is flawed as a system (build a small building to take up park space) and they are not efficient and will require many patches to get it right.\n\nYes, this is an Early Access, but the game is broken. Badly. It looks bad, it plays bad, and overall, you don't have much fun as you play. It just doesn't have a flow like the previous titles. I spent 2 hours playing and felt like I accomplished nothing. Management needs an overhaul. Coaster builder needs fixing.

Dead inside.\nCan't choose where to place entrances or exits to rides, so you can't place rides where you want - you have to place them where they fit. This means you are going to have paths that wrap clear around rides in the most ridiculous ways, just so guests can reach the entrances.\nCan't place shops up against paths. You have to place the back of the shop against the path (assuming the grid will snap correctly), then wrap the path around to the front of the shop. Or place the shop in the middle of the grass, and draw a path to the front of the shop.\nMenu navigation pop-ups are so huge, the words hover over your selections, so you can't see what you're clicking on unless you move your mouse completely out of the way.\nSeriously, just WTF all around.\nThese guys completely botched this game, and destroyed the RCT franchise. It's absolutely nothing like the originals in all the worst ways. I'm just beside myself right now. I don't understand how this is possible. Even for early access, this is a complete disaster.\n\nRIP RCT.","May 28","false","0.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

They pushed it back and back since they cannot meet the deadlines apparently. Then they have applied the smart marketing trick of making it early access: meaning no money left but they desperately need it. Which would be ok I guess BUT:\n\nThere is the tiny problem of an important feature missing: stacking scenery to build buildings etc. Their response: I could go into a 3D software and create my own models of scenery but in game I cannot because it would be too complicated. So a major NO! Rides cannot be customised at all (except for colors and a couple of trees) and thus it feels like a smartphone game rather than a real RollerCoaster Tycoon (even when just considering the graphics). Maybe they will activate that feature in an in app purchase way or add high resolution textures as a DLC. But they stated that they will add rides and scenery and tweek the physics, but that the basics of the mechanics are pretty much done.\n\nIf you are ok with all of these limitations, I can recommend you the game because it does exactly what you expect. If you don't, then keep far, far away from this game!\n\nFinally, on a personal side, due to this "clever" marketing trick and these false promises, I am no longer elegible for a refund of the game: I preordered 2 months before the official release date, the game came out 4 months after the official release date as an early access and I requested a refund with 5 minutes of ingame play - steam says sorry, you have purchased it more than 6 months ago - WHAT?

In terms of usability, it is far too complex in places that could be a lot more simple, too, and for a game that I've wanted since I was about fifteen, this has really let me down. If this was £10, then I would say it was worth the expenditure. But this much money? I definitely would not recommend it. I have honestly never felt this let down by a video game in the past, and I can see a lot of people jumping to this game's direct rival - coaster planet - Upon its release. This is the kind of quality that I would expect from a tablet game. I'll check back in the future and see if RCT can revive my faith in the series, but as of now, it's looking extremely unlikely.

It's great to finally have a follow up in the Rollercoaster Tycoon franshice and for now i'm happy its here.\n\nSome complain about graphics, but I don't really mind looking at what amount of details I can put into the park and how large the park can get. The cartoony still looks great in this game and scrolling down to human level is beautiful in my opinion. I really want to give kudos for the devs for not resizing the levels into a Sim City disasteres small squares.\n\nBut there is were it stops. Looking back to the beta, and now the Early Access (not release) no progress has been made at all. Building coasters is still as broken as it was in the beta. Random impossible twists are added as soon as you place a new piece that looked perfectly fine before placing it. And for some reason, a simple circle coaster is good enough to make everyone vomit and not liking your track. The only thing they fixed since the beta, is that they blame the user for not making a good coaster. THAT IS NOT FIXING THE BUG!\n\nThe game is this bad, that even connecting two paths that run side by side is nearly impossible to do. It just doesn't connect! How can this problem still be in the game! Even when it starts to work, its a big hassle to make it do what you want to do because it just doesn't do what you want.\n\nIn case you're into making the park look nice with a lot of small details and such. You're out of luck with this game. For example, adding benches or lights is a BIG PROBLEM. It's really incosistent and just doesn't allow you to create something nice. The game is keep saying you can't place an item there, when it is able to do it on the other side at exactly the same place and conditions.\n\nAI is also broken. People are 100% hungry, and walk like they really are hungry. But even with a street full of different shops to eat (with prices at $0, and food quality high) they won't eat. The cleanup crew randomly walks through everything and everyway, but barelly cleans something up. I've got over 500 people hired, and it's still a big mess. They even walk over the vomit or trash not doing anything.\n\nI even got a coaster that went broken as soon as I opened it. Even over 500 mechanics, even a few buildings next to that coaster wasn't going to help me having it fixed. And fixing it manually isn't possible. So I had to redo the coaster. Great!\n\nThe other big promise is that you can use User Generated Content. Thats great, but they have no search or filter functionality. No sorting, nothing. It's as bare as it can get. And even than... even than, they can make it crash the game almost everytime you try using it. Losing your game process.\n\nThats anothing thing. In what age are we living in? 1995? Are we still getting "Oops I forgot to save, now I lost everything because of a bug/crash" conversations. Has any of the devs ever heard of autosaving / creating backups?\n\nThe game is as bad as it's beta, and even with the current trend of people hating the game, the money and time the devs will be allowed to fix it will be even more limited. This is just another cash in, a way to steal our money.\n\nDon't buy it, hopefully Planet Coaster will do better. But that is something we only can see in the future.\n\nI hope this game doesn't ruin the franchise and the next game will be better!","April 6","false","19.1"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","13","22","2","0"

I remained hopeful for the EA, and this review is keeping in mind that it's EA. Having played a few EA titles, and knowing how much a title can improve to final release, this review is negative, because I just don't see that it will improve enough to final release to warrant a positive review. Yes, it will improve, but I just dont see that without starting from scrath (again), this game can be salvaged. In any case, keep in mind that this review is of the first EA release.\n\nBut let me start with the positive. For me, at least, it runs smoothly and without problems. Performace wise, then, it's good. That is about all the positive I can say about it. Other than that, nothing positive to report, unfortunately.\n\nThe graphics are, without question, horrible. Nothing close to the "in game" screens we were shown before. The rides, the scenery, foliage, ground textures etc... I haven't seen any redeeming quality to any of it. There are several things I compare this to: RCT3, Planet Coaster (the competitor), Cities Skylines (built on the same engine), other similar sim-type games from the past 10 years. Without fail, I cannot think of any other high-profile game that is worse than the current state of RCTW.\n\nAnimations of rides are adequate I guess, but nothing to write home about. They could do with better physics simulations.\n\nAnimations of peeps - how they move that is - is atrocious. Even RCT3 did a better job at this. They perform several actions and show their emotions (e.g. having to go to the bathroom, hunger, anger, being sick etc.), but the animations are honestly just bad. Even their standard walking and running actions are awkward.\n\nOn that note, peeps look horrible. Colours, textures, shapes, everything. If you're into misformed yellow and brown blobs with creepy unexpressive and oversized eyes, this may be your thing. But no, they are not "cartoony", they just look like they stepped out of a game from the mid-90s.\n\nWhat I may forgive the EA for is peeps, park workers (cleaners, medics etc.) walking through fences, buildings, off-grid paths, each other, to their destination. I may also forgive cleaners sweeping footpaths about 6 feet  away from where the dirt actually is. These can be fixed in future updates. But what will be a tall order to do is the seemingly faulty pathfinding of peeps to their destinations, which at this stage seems worse than in RCT3. The workers also seem to have a wonky work/pathfinding method to get to their next destination. For examply, just in RCT3, janitors are happy to walk straight past 10 puke piles to get to a dropped cup half-way across the park. These kinds of AI behaviours I am less optimistic can be fixed easily.\n\nPaths are very hard to use. The three widths are ok, but their snap points are hard to use. This is a similar problem that Planet Coaster suffers from currently, that foodcourts with tighly packed shops are basically impossible to build. Maybe something that will be resolved.\n\nThis is personal preference, but should be inclued in the review: I am no fan of the pre-made and themed large food stalls and buildings. I much prefer a smaller footprint basic stall and build my own scenery/building around it. For me, at least, Planet Coaster has an advantage here. This is personal preference, if you like plop and forget, then RCTW is for you - just not for me at this time.\n\nThe coaster builder is actually not that hard to use. If I compare it to Planet Coaster's, I would say it's about the same level of difficulty to use. From me, no major complaints with the basic construction side of things. On the other hand, the graphics of coasters, their supports and the physics seem wonky to put it mildly. Much work needed here, but I think it could be done.\n\nOverall mechanics and park management is basically a carbon copy of RCT3. Yes, the heat map and extra graphs may give you a bit more information about the park, and in the future there may be a few extra options in buildings, but overall it is exactly the same and nothing new to see. I also don't see any "placeholders" for future expansions in this realm to get me excited.\n\nTLDR - in conclusion: very unpolished, which may be expected for EA. I personally don't see, however, how it'll be the game that was promised to the community - feels like at this point no matter how much the turd is polished, it remains a turd. Maybe there was too much hype from Atari (understandable marketing) making my expetations too high, but compared to my own expectations, this game falls short. If you have tons of $$ to buy both PC and RCTW, do so. It may be a fun game for a little while and worth the investment down the line. If you only have $$ for one, I'd recommend waiting and spending it on PC, because I don't think this one will be PC's match even at final release. I have both, and will keep both. But I am a sucker, and wouldn't recommend it to others.\n\nI wanted to add a little edit to the end of this review to maybe clarify one point. This review may have been positive, but it is - and I fully acknowledge this - skewed by expectations. This is not my own preconceptions about what I expected the "next-gen" RollerCoaster game to be like, but rather by the expectations I had based on the promises made by Atari reps this past year or so. While Planet Coaster does look much better than RCTW right now, at least graphically, in terms of features it offers much, much less. But - and this is a big but - they folks at Frontier have been very honest with where the game is currently, what they are releasing in the Alpha and why, what they want to test and what kind of feedback they want. On the other hand, the folks at Atari have been spewing AAA, the best, so exciting, full of features, looks awesome, and other such language, which this game is not. At least not currently. So yes, a large part of the negative review is part of the humongous PR failure on Atari's part. If they had kept expectations realistic (not low, but realistic) and were honest what is actually being released - an unpolished pre-alpha stage of the game, I may have had a positive review. But not like this. If I take their word that this game has been in "final optimization and polishing" for the past four months, and is 90% complete, then no, I cannot give it a positive rating. Just wanted to clarify this point. :)","March 30","false","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I would not recommend paying $50 for something that has had the troubled development cycle this game has had. the game crashes, lags when the park is near capacity, the peeps are downright stupid and sometimes don't even stay on the paths correctly. The graphics are not great, including the scenery which looks particularly bad when trying to design something nice to look at.\n\nThis would all be forgivable considering it's "early access", however they may not be trustworthy to fully fix the issues. They've swapped developers twice, have delayed a year and at the last second decides it's early access and then wants $50 from you.\n\nIf you can find a sale for $20, it's got more than enough content here, buggy and all to justify that price point. Not everything is horrible and I had fun building my scifi park. It's just not worth $50 for something that's possibly not a sure thing.

I'm tired of these half finished games especially from an old franchise like RCT.  There's so many missing features in RCTW that RCT3 had, like being able to test your coaster while building it (Maybe its there, but I've yet to find it.  It shouldn't be so hard to find a simple option).  I must add with the roller coster builder is beyond frustrating to use.  For some reason you're not able to add a chain lift peices untill you're done with the coaster.  My next point is Graphics.   I run a GTX 970, 8GB Ram, and Phenom II x4 processor,  I shouldn't have to put everything on medium just to not get choppy graphics.  I hope they end up fixing this pile of garbage soon or I'll be stuck playing RCT1,2,3 for the rest of my life (which actually wouldn't be so bad)","March 30","false","9.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

However as I have come to play this early access now, some of the problems within the coaster design and potential layout of an entire theme park have almost become worse.\n\nIn the first beta of this game I knew the coaster builder needed quite a bit of work done, I did slowly start to get used to parts of it while I was building and managed to get a few functioning coasters going in my park. This new release of the coaster builder places a very opaque sphere where your cursor is to build the next piece, but it is very hard to adjust and manover the placements. It also becomes very jumpy when trying to edit previously added parts to the coaster. Also there is no way to turn it off if you just want to go by segments which I felt was a good addition they said they were going to add in. I would be much happier if I had a button to manually jump between the two, ironically it would make building a coaster much more seamless.\n\nThe other big issue I have is that we no longer have the options to place entrances and exits, I'm not sure if this will be adjusted before release but it removes a degree of customization out of theme park building which we have always had in the RCT series.\n\nI also find the pathing system a little too jumpy. Even the old RCT 1 and RCT 2 pathing was better.\n\nThe benefit to the game that I find is finally the implementation of buildings for mechanics and janitors, instead of just dropping them in the game like the old days.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how much they need to radically change when they exit out of this early access program. I may pop on occasionally over the next little while to see if they take in anymore of what the community is describing as flaws to the game. And if they are successful, I could definitely see myself spending a good amount of time on this game much like my oodles of time spent on the previous games and change this review to a positive.\n\nI guess time will tell.","March 30","false","2.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

First of all the tutorial is a FAQ of text. Altering the terrain really tests your patience with such a tiny brush size and no strength option. You cannot flatten terrain with trees and bushes, however to delete them you have to click on every single bush and tree (which the majority of the time the cursor doesn't sync to what you're trying to delete) - there is no drag a box to delete or brush tool deletion. There is also no undo button, which is extremely handy in building sim games. Laying pavements are frustrating when there is no freetool option and the grid tool is buggy. Camera controls are very limited to WASD to move the camera and scroll wheel adjusts zoom and angle. Basically, TLDR: Worst than previous RCT (buy RCT3) and it's a terrible Early Access Game, save your money until proper release and see what everyone says about improvement/ save for Planet Coaster which looks epic.","March 31","false","7.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

During my playthrough I quickly set up my rides and pathways, even tried out the coaster builder a few times... However we're going to narrow this review down to the good the bad and the ugly parts of the game\n\nTHE GOOD\n\n- Killing Peeps on rides and drowning them is back! And more fun than before!\n- SOYLENT GREEN shop oh my ♥♥♥♥ing god if you're a sadistic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like myself you'll include this in your park... It's kinda mandatory.\n- The graphics aren't bad, they are close to being on par with Sim City and Cities Skylines, but they're nothing special.\n- The sound is great! Hearing the bustleing of peeps and chains pulling coasters over a steep fall, it feels good and sounds appropriate.\n- Modding is there for those who can mod and whatnot and steam workshop will provide adiquate mods for people to try out.\n\n\nTHE BAD\n- Coaster Builder will often Crash your game and your computer! Throught my multiple attempts to use it my monitors will often cut out when the game crashes, causing me to restart constantly. This issue MUST be fixed immidiatly\n-Some peeps are just UGLY and the shopkeepers are absolutely terrifying "THEY STARE INTO THE DARKEST DEPTS OF YOUR SOUUUUUUUUL!!!!:\n-On occasion the framerate will dip and bog down the pc.\n\nTHE UGLY\n-Lack of customization. You cannot customize the rides the same way you could in previous rct games, you can't make your own ride entrences and exits, instead there are preset buildings that you can plop down... I absolutely despise this\n-Coaster Builder is VERY tough to use at times, as you can try to make turns and lifts and dips, your mouse curser may spaz out and cause the track to expand into the ♥♥♥ end of nowhere...\n-Severe Lack of themes for your park... With previous titles you had wester, spooky,industrial, fun themes, ice themes, lava themes, dino, retro, suburbon, in this game there's hardly even a third of what previous games had in terms of themes... I thought this was a Theme park! (I can't even make a bad joke by locking sections of the park off to peeps unless they cough up money, so no paywall joke/ dlc joke for me")\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nWhile the game can get addicting, and can be quite fun when it works, the glareing issues this game has is unbearable, even for an early acess game... I thought they delayed the game so that they can fix the issues, instead I see some the same issues I saw in the Beta!\n\nI guess I'll wait till planet coaster comes out and see how it fares.","March 31","false","10.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Since this review was written, there have been several bug fixes and graphical improvements made to the game. While the game still has it's slew of bugs and some needed changes to gameplay (the path system still sucks but they're working on a redesign), it is better than when it first launched. While I still can't recommend this game in it's current state, I have no doubt that if Nvissio continues to act on the feedback of the players, this will actually turn into a worthy successor in the RCT franchise.\n\nGraphics: 6/10\nBetter looking than its twelve year old predecessor, but still dated for 2016	Gameplay: 4/10\nWhile the coaster builder is fun, bugs and minor annoyances detract from its overall enjoyment and poor optimization means even the most powerful computer might only scratch 15 fps.Series Innovation: 5/10\nWhile a lot was added to this entry (fully customizable coaster builder, restaurants, curved and larger size paths) a lot was also taken away. The amount of rides and coaster styles you can build is less than what it was in its predecessors, and you can’t build rides that go underground or roller coasters that don’t connect to the end (e.g shuttle loops).Overall: 5/10\nRollercoaster Tycoon World (RCTW) has the potential to be a worthy addition to the famed Rollercoaster Tycoon (RCT) series, but in it's current state it's bogged down by bugs, missing features, and a stack of minor annoyances which shouldn't exist in a game after two years of development.\nI absolutely loved the first three RCT games and in 2014 when RCTW was first announced I was excited to see what the newest game could bring after ten years of new and improved gaming technology. Then the original developer was replaced, and the replacement developer was also replaced and the release date for RCTW kept getting pushed back from its initial “early 2015” date. Finally, at the end of Q1 in 2016, Nvissio and Atari released their Early Access Beta, a year after originally planned, and still not the final release. After playing RCTW for a couple of hours, I must say that I am somewhat disappointed in the progress that has been made after two years.\n\nWhile the graphics are improved from it’s predecessor, RCT3, the game does look dated for 2016 and what game engines and computers are capable of (at a 1GB download I was kind of expecting that). Polygon reduction when zooming out is very noticeable, and trees go from leafy to a three shaded blob without any middleground. Additionally, the park visitors just look kind of… weird. They have a tendency to run almost wildly flailing their arms which just looks funny and the look only marginally better than their now twelve year senior counterparts. Rides on the other hand do look much better than back in 2004, but look more like they would be in a game released four or five years ago, not now.\n\nThe game is hampered by a number of bugs, with many people reporting that the game won’t load past 57% ( I have not had this issue myself). Additionally, there are issues with the game freezing and crashing at random times during gameplay, and on the “Frolicking Forest” map, the terrain editor only removes the polygons of the terrain and you still can’t place paths or rides unless they are above the previous terrain height.\n\nGameplay wise, it’s actually kind of fun but there are a lot of annoyances that really cut away at it after only a few minutes. The coaster builder is pretty fun, but it’s also pretty hard to just get a straight line out of it. It would also benefit from having a stand alone coaster builder built into the game instead of only having the option to load a map and build it during a game. Additionally, for a “beta” there is a wide variety of shops and stalls, but it is very limited ride wise, with only a handful of roller coaster styles and a few different “flat rides” with varying scenery to choose from which seems interesting considering it’s a game built around building rides at its core. Additionally, the roller coasters have to connect, no more building shuttle loops for an easy payday. The main annoyance that’s been plaguing me is that there is no area demolish. Every bush, shrub, and tree that is there when the map loads needs to be individually clicked on to destroy, with is rather tedious. I do like that there are now larger paths that can be built, but there are times when the game won’t let me make a straight path, especially when making a short path that connects to another path. Another annoyance is that you have to build shops and stalls offset from the main path, and have to build a path to connect it to the main path which adds in an extra step and is also tedious, especially when your path doesn’t want to just go straight.\n\nPlaying RCTW, you can see hints of the potential that this entry has, and with some polish and more development work, I do think that this can be a good game. However, with the way Atari has been treating this game over the past two years, I don’t really believe any major amount of progress will be made, and the game will forever be one of those “What could have been” examples.","March 30","false","4.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Fully maxed at 4K, I'm not really impressed at the looks of the game - it reminds of me of RCT3.  Gameplay wise, there's no in-depth park management, building straight paths is a nightmare (even with the grid on), and tbh there's just no fun in building a beautiful park like in RCT 1/2.

I've been a RCT fan since the first one, and I was overly excited to RCTW as the start when Atari announced back in 2014. Just bought it in November, I was upset with the launch delay, but ok, I understood.\n\nBut now, this EA (which is not an beta or alpha) looks really bad. I gotta say, not everything, but here are certain things that really dissapointed me, and I hope that Nvizzio will fix. Some of them was in the previous RCT games.\n\n- Everything is just too much big. (Even the food store, which I think is the smallest thing in the game)\n- The path tool didn't work to attach some things (some ridiculous things, it's hard to attach the queue lines in those)\n- You have NO CONTROL of the employees, and it's unnecessary to need a giant building to hire them. (You can't even set a specific place for them to stay)\n- There's no research for the things just like was before. You can unlock the things only completing the goals. I didn't like it.\n- You have very poor information and control of the guests (You can't ammount them by sorting the thinking or the feeling.\n- A simple roller coaster (yeah, really small and smooth track) it's getting a extreme-high level of Nausea, making about 80% of the people throwing their stomachs out by the exit of the track, making the paths incredible dirty.\n\nI will not talk about the graphics, the lagging, the low frame rate, and the visual of the peeps, which you can find more complains here in another review.\n\nIt's playable.

Very poor start for this Early Access return of the Roller Coaster Tycoon series.  For a 2016 game, i haven't seen character designs as poor as this for the past decade or more.  The RollerCoaster building tools themselves are very rough and dont handle well at all (camera repositioning itself as track sections are added and removed which then throws me off while designing).   THe overall performance of the game is lackluster, with the game freezing up as buildings or tracks are placed.\n\nMany times the phrase "its an Early Access game" has been said to soften the blow of incomplete releases, but since this is being published by Atari, which is not a small time company by any stretch of the imagination, "its Early Access" just holds no water, especially after multiple delays and apparently shifts in development houses.\n\nThe developers and publisher of this game should be ashamed of themselves for releasing such a cobbled together mess.

I have a fairly high end rig and this game ran pathetically; peeps don't walk and glide, fps is very low, coaster builder is laggy.  The graphics are just terrible, barely upgraded from RCT3.  The water is just dreadful....why does it look like copper sulphate solutions?! It's not that blue!\n\nThe coaster builder is a double-edged sword...the potential to build anything you want is brilliant...you can make the coaster into exactly what you want...it is just so damn fiddly!  One great positive is the testing stats overlay that you get...it highlights the areas of the coaster that has the highest nausea inducing spirals that can really help when trying to perfect a ride as well as pointing out where the excitement is highest; that aspect is brilliant.\n\nAll in all, I feel really disappointed with this game.  The number of bugs is staggering and issues is staggering.  I really wanted to love this game, but as it stands at the moment, I just can't.  In some respects, the developers have listened to the community from the pre-alpha but it still has light-years to go before I would recommend.\n\nI just hope that the developers really try and fix this....otherwise its the end of a great series.  So far, the developers have certainly been fixing the major issues with posts and that.  I remain confident that with some time and feedback, they will turn this into the game that it should be.\n\nEDIT 4/4/16:  Having played the game for a bit longer now, I can see the potential in this game about what could be.  Having changed the graphics settings to their highest (the autoconfig didn't do this) and their not actually that bad, so you can ignore that from my previous review!

My main complaint is with the new paths engine.  This is the way you build and connect paths and queues in the game, and it is borderline unusable becuase connecting to existing paths is difficult and building grid-aligned paths has been made harder in order to support more organic shapes.  The developers claim this is one area of focus for improvement, which is the only redeeming factor.\nBeyond that, there are various graphic bugs I've noticed while playing and sometimes the rides just stop running and need a manual stop and start.

Please redesign it.\n\nRollercoaster Tycoon World 7/10\nSimple and beautiful flat designed UI, with cool animation, easy to get started, but there are some translation errors and menu selection bugs at the current stage, which should be fixed after I believe.\n\n2 Game Elements\n\n2.1 Rides\n\nPlanet Coaster 8/10\nRides totally functioned and animated beautifully, guests can interact with the rides perfectly, coaster can be easily built and mounted.\n\nRollercoaster Tycoon World 7/10\nRides totally functioned and animated beautifully, guests can interact with the rides but due to the awful guest model, it's ugly, coaster can be easily built and mounted.\n\n2.2 Guests\n\nPlanet Coaster 9/10\nPerfect cartoon guest art style, featured tons of differnet animation which makes the park alive and artistic, but guest types are too narrow, too repeated.\n\nRollercoaster Tycoon World 0/10\nTotally piece of sh1+, dumbass motherfcker super b1+ch puzzy cun+. What the FK is this? Guest? Peep? I'd better which Justin Bieber dancing rather than watching those lame cheap craps walking and running. Don't release the game until the designers who designed those guests are fired by Atari.\n\n2.3 Park Landscape\n\nPlanet Coaster 8/10\nGreat Lanscapes, piece by piece building system (MOD), very good vista and flexiable terrain system with infinte possibilites. And many themes available.\n\nRollercoaster Tycoon World 5/10\nAcceptable but still needs to be polished, the cars parked outside are repeated and meaning nothing, and there are only 2 types of themes (meadowland and western). Vista is super ugly,\n\n2.4 Path\n\nPlanet Coaster 3/10\nVery bad path algorithm. I can not build stright paths and build linear stations, too bad, please redesign your algorithm for path system.\n\nRollercoaster Tycoon World 6/10\nPath system is OK. I can build stright and bend paths as I want but still a little bit harder. And another very bad thing is the path seems to be floating on the land surface instead of stay right on the land surface, which makes the game looks cheaper.\n\n3 Extra\nFor the rest of the parts such as optimization, advanced graphic or steam workshops and so on, I am not gonna review at the current stage because the game is not actually finished.\n\nFinal Score:\nPlanet Coaster\n(8+9+6+8+9+8+3) / 7 = 7.3\nRollercoaster Tycoon World\n(4+6+7+7+0+5+6) / 7 = 5.0","March 30","false","1.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Then they skipped the next weekends for the pre-orders. They lied about the December release date, then did not post any news for MONTHS.

The path system is a joke, I can't connect paths without FPS loss, and weird snap issues and bugs. Coaster editor... What? It makes no sense. RCT 3 is so much better than this, even graphics wise.

If they would just  play the game for like 5 hours before releasing it, they would know that the game is messed up.  The system of deletion and snapping are jacked.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CraftyApe/recommended/282560/","CraftyApe","Crafty Ape","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CraftyApe/","415 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWe can take for granted that an early access game will be rough round the edges, and we must be prepared for plenty of quirks and bugs.\nHowever one has to wonder just how far into the development this game is, when core functionality is so fundamentally broken.\nTake as an example, when you begin a campaign, besides a extreme stutter, which I will get into shortly, after picking one of just three areas to start in, you will often find yourself with only one build option; rides.\nGranted, the intention is of course that different creation options will unlock for you as you progress in the game, however on numerous occasions, besides the rides category, the other options would unlock much later than necessary (that is assuming they ever unlock). Like in the previous Rollercoaster Tycoon games, you need to place rides and shops far enough from the paths to provide space for a substantial length of an entrance queue. After placing a number of rides, you may notice that you have no means of drawing a path to them. What this leads to is hundreds of visitors entering the park after paying the £5 entrance fee, merely to walk back and forth on the small stretch of preset pathway at the entrace, getting increasingly tired and frustrated, and feeling understandably ripped off. To make things worse, if you have opened those rides in the vain hope that these visitors will get off the beaten path and make the trek across the grass to ride the helter skelter (heads up: they won't), soon enough the rides will inevitably break down simply from normal test usage. Nevermind, you can get mechanics on the job because it looks like the Buildings category finally opened up! Oh wait, you can't build a pathway. Right, that's really brought things to a halt.\n\nThe interface adds insult to injury when notifications pop up, giving you a series of requests like "hey, it's kinda dark, can you please add some lamps?" or "hey your customers can't get to this ride, can you build a pathway to it?", and "hey, your ride has broken down, can you get your mechanics on it?" - And my response to them all is "I WOULD IF YOU LET ME!".\n\nIn spite of this locked interface bug occurring a couple of times for me, I was lucky enough to start a campaign where the interface did function normally, and all the features unlocked for me within a reasonable time, more or less consistently. Besides the slightly cumbersome building/ride rotation mechanic (an 8 way snapping rotation would be preferable), and the fact that the auto rotation assignment (based upon the path you are placing the building next to) works less than half the time, the game actually feels surprisingly functional in spite of those finnicky issues. As for the coaster creation, it is fantastic! I had a blast designing an intricate coaster with ease. However it can be a little tedious to keep testing the ride every time you make a change to ensure that it works. It would be preferable if there were a feature that allowed you to simply test the last segment that you added, rather than the whole ride from the begining.\n\nIndeed, it does not seem to be far-fetched to assume a finished product could be comparable to Cities: Skylines in terms of quality and design. There will undoubtedly need to be a lot more in the way of content, as there is not even close to the amount of building and ride option or design variation compared with the previous Rollercoaster Tycoon games- but of course a lack of content is to be expected in early access.\nPerhaps one thing which really leaves a gaping hole, is the lack of in-depth creation. For example, the paths are laid with a line-drawing tool rather than a grid system which prevents creating little patio areas or plazas by hand, forcing you to use the preset ones. I am not sufficiently convinced that this will be changed in future patches or indeed upon the final game's release, because the Tycoon game industry seems to be moving towards this more "accessible" route, at the cost of player's creativity. I noticed this with Thrillville and Zoo Tycoon and other games of this style, but I would love Rollercoaster Tycoon World to prove me wrong and break away from this trend.\n\nI mentioned before that the game was stuttering. Although my PC's hardware is decidedly outdated for this 'generation', the parts exceeded the minimum and recommended specs for the game. For perspective, I can run Cities Skylines on Very High settings with smooth and responsive performance, even when my city spans across 5 regions and is filled with tens of thousands of people. I can also run Grand Theft Auto V at very high settings at around 50FPS. So, I cannot say I was not disappointed that the performance for Rollercoaster Tycoon World is abysmal. The game is not bad looking (though I'd argue not nearly as attractive or impressive as Cities Skylines), it is perhaps the best looking theme park tycoon game, and to be honest, it is a more up-close and personal style of tycoon game, with far more attention to detail than others in the same vein, with a naturally more dynamic environment. When you zoom into your park, you can get a lot closer than many tycoon games usually allow, and you can witness how the branches of palm trees sway in the wind,  a person behind the desk at a ride's entrace with the ride's buttons and controls, and see the little gate swing open for the customers, see kids running with excitement holding the balloons or other souvenirs they bought, etc. I expect that the finished product will look beautiful with just a hint of polish here and there, and perhaps a bit more detail in buildings and shops (most of the shops are identicle besides the large mascot/statue on the top). I would, for example, to see t shirts actually displayed in the window of the t shirt shops, and fridges with drinks actually displayed in the drink stalls, and burgers being made in the burger stalls. I recall the game The Movies by Lionhead allowed you to zoom into a burger stall and see a man actually cooking the individual burgers.... that was over a decade ago, so I am sure that in the $CURRENT_YEAR, it shouldn't be too much to request that the team behind RCTW are able to put at least a similar amount of effort into detail that Lionhead was able to achieve 11 years ago. But sadly, even if they did, that would only make the performance issues worse.\nIt is already extremely uncomfortable for people who even meet the recommended system requirements, and even more-so when you choose to speed-up time. Freezes, unresponsive UI and generally horrendous stutter are present even on lower graphics settings.\n\nIn conclusion, there is a lot that needs to be fixed and improved. I would certainly recommend fanatics of the franchise to get the early access game if they have ridiculously strong hardware, as when the game GUI is not misbehaving, the game shows a lot of promise and it is certainly quite enjoyable. I apologise if most of the review is criticizing rather than praising, but I felt that the negative did outweigh the positive for the most part. So, unless you fall into the category of "fanatic with future-proofed hardware", avoid the game for now but keep your eye on it, as I expect great things to come.\n\nIf by the game release, there is a solution to whatever is undermining performance, the content is greatly expanded upon, the visuals are a little more refined, there is more free-rein and features that enable creativity and of course providing the remaining bugs are ironed out, I have no doubt that this game could be absolutely amazing. Especially with Steam Workshop support.

Absolutely awful. 107 minutes in and I just couldn't take the mess any more. Already requested and received my refund.  This game was supposed to be out months ago... and here we are, 3 months late, and it's still 'early access'? I can understand a few glitches here and there, but this is ridiculous. 60% of the time, the game won't load, and when it does load, functions of the game won't turn off when switched on..... for example, I turned on the 'heat map' feature to find my most popular ride. The heat map would not disable and conveniently covered the menu button so I could not save and reload the game... 45 minutes of game gone to a rookie league glitch. The peeps are glitchy and half of them just 'float' instead of actually walk and move... the ride camera stops working and the peeps on the ride appear to detach from the ride and kind of hover over the seats.. this game that is incredibly late is almost unplayable.\n\nI wanted to like it. I really did. I've loved the genre since game 1, but Atari really screwed the pooch. I will be buying Planet Coaster which is made by the same people who created the first 2 rollercoaster tycoon games...

However some parts are still confusing to me when I try to build and especially with the add-ons like twists and loopings and they give me an error and I cannot continue to build. So I avoid adding those which is immidiatly what does dissapoint me about this builder. I should be able to just add these things. The fact that there is very little explaination as you first start building doesn't help either and for some odd reason I cannot get the tutorials to work so I'm stuck on that.\n\nOverall the coaster builder is not bad.\n\nNow for everything else. I like the designs of the flat rides but at the same time I wish I could edit them. Because I like the size and how they made it I would like to be able to change the colours and such. I miss that. I also feel like there aren't enough rides or even pre-made coasters. I assume thats where the steam workshop comes into play but I haven't quite gotten around to looking at that. I mostly miss water rides. There is a few that have water around them which makes them look cool but no actual water rides. But I miss the monorail type rides the most of all. I don't quite understand why those are not in here.\n\nThe shops also miss customizing but I do like the variety in them. Especially the restaurants though it would also be great if peeps stopped saying they're hungry while I built all of them and there is a place to eat every few steps. I'm not quite sure how you can be hungry then.\n\nPaths....those are just bad. Atleast to connect paths is just not fun at all. I don't quite understand why I cannot connect a path from a restaurant to the main path the way I want it placed. I don't want some odd kink in it. I don't want to have to lenght it further just so it will connect to a certain piece of the main path. Since when does path making have to be so frusterating? Because that is just what it is. Frusterating.\n\nScenery. I am missing so many things in here. All my parks start to look the same because there simply isn't enough variety. Not to mention that I cannot place things on the path 85% of the time! Why can't I just place a simple bench on the path? Also bridges.

Picking them up makes my screen flicker so that doesn't help and I simply cannot adjust anything about any of my workers. Not work clothes, not areas they walk or who does what.\n\nThe land tool.

If it improves then yes as this game has a lot of potential for both casual gamers and more die hard gamers who love to built stuff.","April 5","false","42.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

At first I forgave them, because it was in Early Access.\n\nLet's start with the positives (of which there are few), though. We have to give this game a chance, right?\n\nGood things:\n-Snazzy new coaster builder\n-Snazzy new paths builder\n-I REALLY like the new restaurants which replace basic food stands\n-Cars in coaster trains can be different colours\n-The new water tool isn't efficient at all but it's top banter\n\nThat's it.\nAnyway, back to the negatives (of which there are many):\n\nNot only did I learn that this game was not made by the original developers, but I also noticed more and more things that are catastrophically wrong with this game. For a start, it's massively overpriced.\n\nThen you get into the rollercoaster ratings. I simply cannot get anywhere in the campaigns because rollercoasters are rated as high intensity WAYYYY too easily, and in order to make a 'coaster that is exciting at all, it needs to have pretty much ultra-extreme intensity... so nobody rides it and you just lost 20,000 monies, pal.\n\nYou only have a small amount of music choices, and they are just variations of exactly the same tune in a depressingly low quality, which drives you bloody insane in five minutes.\n\nSometimes when you place custom tracks using the snazzy new spline coaster builder, you cannot add another section because the new secton has to be a pre-built track. This is probably hard to understand, and we face a dilemma because in order to properly understand you need to play the game, but that is something you absolutely do not want to do.\n\nI thought I could deal with the supports problem but it is SO common that it is UNFORGIVEABLE. It is so infuriating to have a nice creation utterly ruined and the immersion completely shattered by a track support going through the middle of your loop.\n\nBut BY FAR THE WORST PROBLEM is the optimisation. Having spent £960 on a computer, which I have to say is a very good one, you'd expect to get good performance on this game. Right?\n\nNOOOO!\n\nOn the very lowest settings on a flat map with a couple of rollercoasters, my computer struggles to reach 20fps. On a map with varied terrain and many rollercoasters, I might as well be watching a slideshow.\n\nI will now proceed to wait impatiently for Planet Coaster, after learning that it was actually made by the developers of RCT3 and it's not just a cheap knockoff of the RCT series. You want to know what a cheap knockoff of the RCT series is?\n\nThis game.","April 9","false","6.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","8","13","4","1"

The interface offers very few options for tailoring the way you move around, and in its present form is frustratingly clumsy. Paths and Cues are hard to join up.

There doesn't appear to be any way of placing paths and tracks through hills, and etc.\n\nThis game is not worth it for the price you pay.

Of the three, this is the more "complete" game, but that's using the word "complete" very loose.\n\nPlanet Coaster is a beautiful and easy to learn game. It is like using a lego set to construct whatever your imagination can allow you to,  but it is very early in Alpha and just consists of a sandbox mode. It's fun for what it is, but it's far from complete and has zero business management at this time. That said, I expect Planet Coaster to be the best of the three when everything is said and done.\n\nParkitect is also very early in release and, like Planet Coaster, is just a Sandbox mode. It's a nice indie title that is wonderful considering only a few people are developing it.  It also has promise but is too early in development to really make a strong decision either way.   Like Planet Coaster, absolutely zero business management in it at this time.\n\nThis game...there's lots to be frustrated with, but also alot to have fun with as well.  I think this game has a place with both Planet Coaster and Parkitect, but it needs a ton of TLC and polish to really compete with Planet Coaster down the road.\n\nI like some aspects about this game, but only because I was looking for something to scratch the business management itch of a theme park.   This is the only one out right now that touches on that aspect.  And I use the word "touches" loosely as well.\n\n\nI do recommend this only if your expectations are that you will be getting a game that is in early access. There is plenty that works with this game, but plenty that is broken.\n\nIf you can accept this than it's worth consideration.  Truthfully i think this game is worth more like $19.99 at this stage, but if you don't mind paying what they are asking and have a metric ton of patience, then this might be up your alley.","April 9","true","7.8"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","18","33","2","0"

This led me to give a negative review.  The thing I didnt realize was that if i looked past the bugs in the editor, like the twisting of the track, the support columns being placed in irritating places causing the coaster to run into them, or items not lining up with the grid, the editor was, in fact, the most powerful piece of software I have seen in a coaster game (RCT 1/2/3, No Limits 2, etc. etc.)  I took the time today to really attempt to figure out how the software was to work for me instead of fighting it.  After 2 hrs today, I have finally figured it out and have build a coaster that was IMO, free drawn.  After testing the coaster, you see where sh*t crashes and a few of the bugs causing this (pillars) but this is the point.   It is a process of perfecting your design.  Build, test, tweak, build, test, tweak.  The ability to allow such freehand movement has "in a way" made me feel as though i was using a design software such as AutoCAD.  Yes, this beta is bare bones and there are hardly any features unlocked, but they are breaking the game down into the bare-bones in order to ask the communitry what we like or do not like.  Imagine if they released a beta with all the bells and whistles.  You would not notice very minute problems in the 3 days they test for.  Yes, the editor takes time.  You almost have to train yourself (which in a video game, is not what I look for, for fun) but it does present a challenge, and challenges I like.  So, after refunded the game last night after being a little disappointed, I have decided to give it another go.  I'm glad I did.  These are not gamebreaking issues and I have absolute faith that these folks developing the game are striving to create one of the best.\n\nFor those people who like to place "premade" coasters (which I also love to do when I'm not in the mood to build), there will be a slew of them according to the devs along with Steam Workshop support and mods.  Besides that, I believe there will be tons of content in free DLC and updates as the devs have promised.  There will also be the "old" track editor in the game like we are all used to in the old RCTs if you want to place tracks that way.  The point is, you don't HAVE to use the coaster editor but I want them to keep it, just fix it.\n\nAlthough, I judged the game on the beta, I have learned not to do this as it is not indicative of the final product.   But do not take my review as saying "buy this game" because I'm not saying that.  I am saying "WAIT" to buy this game or if you are easily frustrated, wait until the second beta.\n\nMy hardware:\n\nIntel Core i7 2.5Ghz, 16 GB RAM, Nvidia Geforce 980M 4 GB VRAM, Windows 10\n\n\nThings that need fixing:\n\nCoaster editor bugs:\n\nProblems in auto pillar placement glitching thru the track\nRandom twisting in the track while attempting to edit a mid track segment\nMouse pointer/game desyncing\nWhen clicking on a node mid track, the track should not move until you apply whatever adjustments you are making (right now when clicking, the node will jump randomly of the screen and mess up what u have created"\nLive grid doesnt line up with piece you are trying to place sometimes.\n\nNot bugs but add this: No "undo" button, add edge of screen scrolling or right clicking on map to drag camera\n\n\nDecorations:\nItems snap into areas you dont want them to go, once again, using freehand placement and grid (this is one of the issues that doesn't allow me to feel as though I have control over what I'm doing (which is premise of this whole game).  Example was, placed a path laid out according to the grid.  Attempted to place light posts, bushes, and benches.  They would line up on one side of the path, but on the other side, the bench or the posts would be off increasing my OCD.  I turned off the grid to attempt it freehand.  Same thing. So this needs fixing\n\nThe ability to "change path color" without deleting the path.  This is annoying.  It also defaults to the ugly red color even after you have been using the other paths so you place the path and realize, you have to delete and choose the right one and do it again.\n\nEDIT: Also add an "upgrade function" to either change the color of the path or upgrade size from small to large and vice-versa.\n\nTerrain Tools:\n\nTerrain works well.\nAlthought the zoom feature to increase/decrease brush size is nice and natural, add a brush size setting as to allow people to have that "option".  Keywords in all of this is "options".  The more options to build, the better, and the more people will buy the game.\n\n\n\nHope this has cleared things up.  Once again, the game IS based on the coaster editor but it will not be the ONLY building tool for coasters, but it will be there if you wanna use it, which i recommend (after being tweaked and fixed) in order to give you total freedom to build how you want.\n\n\nTL:DR:\n\nThis is a "beta" more like an "alpha" but the game is stripped of the bells and whistles to address a select few items as to focus beta tester's attention to just those items in order to collect as much data and feedback to be able to fix the issues and give us as players what we want.\n\nMy advice to potential buyers is to buy this game, LATER.  Just don't buy it NOW.  WAIT until the next beta  to see how the devs have progressed on addressing the above issues.  I have total faith these folks will fix the issues and bring us a great game but may require pushing back the release of the game if needed so this doesn't end up like SimCity.  I will give them a chance and after next beta, if the issues still remain, I will get a refund.\n\n\n\n\n\nUPDATE 03/30/2016: I have since upgraded my PC since writing the above review.  Specs are below:\n\ni5-6600K\n16GB RAM\nGTX 980TI Hybrid 6GB\nWindows 10 Pro 64 Bit\n\nI get 144FPS with frame rate drops to 10 fps.  Crashes, bugs, etc.  The loading screen looks like a gay pride parade with rainbow colors flickering across the screen.  Then when the peeps enter the park they are jumping around like a bunch of idiots all frolicking and ♥♥♥♥.  It took me 2 hours to build a coaster and then the game crashed, losing all my progress.  FFS\n\nThere has been ZERO progress IMO as far as fixing what I stated above.  Honestly, I don't want to waste anymore time on reviewing this game.  Not really a game but more a job.  I feel like I should be getting paid to play this.  It's not even fun.\n\nI must've been smoking some good ♥♥♥♥ when I wrote the above review.  WTF have you people done for the last few months while pushing this back?  None of the above issues were fixed.  The grid is still garbage, the coaster builder is still trash.  Even after adding the manual track builder, that ♥♥♥♥ doesn't even work right.  I add a premade track piece and its all twisted up like a noodle.  It's like Ray Charles decided he was going to make a game, while driving, while giving other people directions on how to drive.  Give it up.  SHUT IT DOWN!!!! Everyone that buys this and cannot get a refund needs to open up a class action lawsuit.  Why?  Because it takes you 2 hrs to even get the coaster builder to work correctly.  I could build a five star condo in the time it takes for me to build 3 track pieces and most people will spend 2 hours doing that and cannot get a refund.  DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE, I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE!!  GET PLANET COASTER.\n\n\nTL:DR:  DON'T F**KING DO IT. DO NOT BUY THIS.  SHUT IT DOWN ATARI, SHUT IT DOWN NVIZZIO.

The game industry has not had a decent theme park simulator in such a long time. And this year we are expecting two, I want both to do well :)\n\nMy biggest issue so far is the path system. It's very VERY fidgity at the moment, I would like to see it improved, maybe some option to not have rounded path ends (unless I missed it).\n\nThe coaster builder take some time to get used to, It's not bad but not great either. I try my best to create realistic feeling roller coasters but it does take quite a bit of patience to create a coaster without having the intensity be really high or nausea rating really high.\n\nI like that there is the option of flexibility and not fitting things to a grid. But even with the grid or snap turned on I still struggle to get things to fit in place or line up, Again especially with the path system.\n\nThe look of the game is not that bad! It's definatley nicer than the first Atari Trailer released. Although I think this is a different studio to that one. It's not super duper detailed, but the gameplay needs way more improvement than graphics at this point. Graphics are not everything but framerate issues are a thing in this game. For the most part it's smoothe but I have experienced the daunting screen jitter and lag too. This is annoyingly a big thing on the coasters however, especially the coaster cam when it comes to turning corners! Really needs to be smoothed out.\n\nAt its current state it needs a lot of polish!

I don't know, I don't like that way to build coasters at all.\n\nI don't know whats under the hood of if its fixable but there is no excuse for how badly this game runs.\n\nLets also be clear, I'm no fan of planet coaster and think so many aspects of that game are worse then this one, largely due to me not being creative enough to build custom things that look nice. If you want a roller coaster game, rct2 with the opencrt2 mod, some people love rct3, or the new and possibly best roller coaster game, Parkitect are what you should be looking at, the 2 big hitters (this and planet coaster) rely to much on mods and community to be fun for me...

Then they extended the releasedate with 3 months. Great! I hope the game will benefit.  But nope, almost all of the complaints made with the pretty unplayable beta 5 months ago still remain in the game. And if a developer does not fix the main problems in the game within 5 months I lose my trust in this game becoming anything great. I tried to like it,  I really tried, but its clunky controls and camera ruined it all, just like in the beta.\n\nI had such high hopes, especially with the extended release date and the great competition that is Planet Coaster and Parkitect. I hoped that they would learn from those games and see how it should have been done. But no, the controls are still clunky, the game still sound terrible and  the worst is that most anoyances like fence placement still hasn't been fixed. It's not that they didn't do anything these months, they implemented the peeps, more rides, a piece by piece coaster builder, a strange campaign and graphics options. But no fixing the main problems...\n\nSo in short, if you want to play a new game like Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, buy Planet Coaster which is in early alpha right now on their website and if you want to play a game like RCT1/RCT2 buy Parkitect which is also in early alpha and should arrive at steam in a few months. But please don't be as stupid as me, please don't buy this game in its current state. I really hope they can turn the sinking ship around and still make a great game of it after Early access.","March 30","false","3.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I preordered it when it was first announced at E3 in 2015.     Got my first try during the beta in late 2015.   I was pretty let down at that point last year.   But I thought it's likely pretty early and it will be a ton better by release the following year in 2016.\n\nFinally hear it's going Early Access and well I didn't have much problem with that..    finally get to play the Early Access build.    And well I'm not happy.     The game performs worse than it did in the beta..     40-50fps on a GTX 980Ti?!    After building a few rides performance tanked to around 20-30fps.        I could maybe understand that if I was running a GTX 950 or something.   But this is a $600 video card!      Not to mention it looked like the team made little to no progress since the beta last year.    What have they been doing for the past 4 months?!\n\nAll I can say is thanks for Steam refunds...

In fact RCT 1 was the best. So many levels you can play with different goals and lovly created maps. You really can see how much love the developers sent to RCT 1 and 2. But after RCT 3 was released it wasn't mine at all. The gameplay wasn't the focus anymore. Instead the graphics and the possibilties to drive your coasters were gone to be focused. But there were no lovely levels at all anymore.... So far to the old ones....\n\nNow to RCT W: This game, in fact, is nice to watch. The graphics are very well created and animated.... but that's, by far, is all I can review positve at all.\nI mean, you have to know it's still an Early-Access so it's still under development. But: There are so many bugs that the game is still unplayable. The service personals are stuck on roads. They neither move nor do their work. Some functions told in tips can't be used, e.g. the service personal's route. You can't change or even select anythin like this.\nThe placement of roads, coasters and buildings are terrible. You made a road and cross it with another. Then, because of the crossing point, you aren't even able to put bins or banks onto the roads or lanterns.... Banks, bins or anything like these are small tiles which cannot be placed on a big road because another is crossing it... there is a big place you cannot build onto... Hope they fix it...\n\nPeople's movement is broken. They do not walk over the raods, they are flying over it when you scroll out of the map.\nThe pathfinding is better then in RCT 1 where people run completly random on the raods. Here they take the way they want to get the coaster of their choice. But the movement is still buggy and broken...\n\nAnd at least, to make it more funny... I only have a notebook with notebok graphics... but it is still a GTX980M. One of the heigher graphic cards.... and After each building and attraction my framerate drops little lower... I begin this game with 60 FPS. After 3 Coasters and several other attractions my frames cannot climb over 21 per seconds.... That's not normal... I have tested different maps and coaster types and everytime the same issues... Building more attractions decrease FPS. Seems that the graphic is rendering everything in the park even if you are not focusing the attraction in the active window.... And by that: The game is using 3 GB RAM (active) and the cpu-usage ist too damned high... Even a mondern shooter or anything like that is not using more 20% of cpu  (got a Intel core i7-4720 HQ) but this game is using up to 70%... I do not know whether the cpu is supporting the graphics and whether the graphics are made within the cpu... but at this level with all this bugs and mistakes and mismakes... the game isn't worth to be bought... And never worth to be bought at this price...\n\nI will look forwards for updates and may update this review when updates make it better... otherwise I won't spend any time at all in wrinting for this game... Seems that I need to look closer to planet coaster too :/\n\nChris Sawyer.... please come back and rescue this amazing game you made early we all loved","April 8","false","3.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Unfortunately I do have to agree with a lot of the negative reviews.\nThe game is nowhere near ready. It's poorly optimized, very buggy and is missing important features. But on saying that it is a early access game so I didn't expect it to be perfect.\nI love building rollercoasters, I never used pre made coasters in RCT3 and I don't plan to in this either but after 2 hours of trying to build a coaster I gave up because you have to mess about with to many things just to get the right angle on the track. I do like the fact that there are more options in coaster building but I think they took it slightly to far.\nA few things I want to see in the game is a 'basic' and 'advanced' option on coaster building, basic being the same as RCT3. Edge scrolling is a must for me to, I hate having to move the camera around with the keyboard all the time. Bulldozing is annoying to as you can only delete a single thing at a time so if you have a load of trees, plants or scenery you want to get rid of it takes ages! They need to add a click and drag system to delete multiple things at once and when placing objects and rides, auto delete trees and plants that are in the way.\nI could go on but at the moment I can't recommend buying this game. The devs are saying they are working hard on the game but it isn't getting many updates yet.\nI really hope they get this game right in the end but its looking like 2 or 3 months before I can make a final decision.","April 4","false","6.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Overall, I can't really recommend it. The one time I  actually tried to play the campaign, it crashed on me within 10 minutes.\n\nPros:\n\nCreating a model and getting it into the game is super easy if you're familiar with Unity. I spent almost all my free time this weekend modeling and then testing it in the game. I'm going to enjoy making models for this game.\n\nGame is looking better. It still needs some work, but I feel there's a good balance between graphics and performance.\n\nCons:\n\nCrashed within 10 minutes of actually attempting to play the campaign. I'm not interested in sandbox mode except to test my models; I want the management sim part of the game as much as the rest.\n\nModding side of the game is sorely missing some features, like the ability to give names to the individual models in a pack, set their prices, and give them descriptions.\n\nSeriously lacking in decoratives. Sure, we can fill that section out, but they should provide a fair number of them, too.\n\nCould never download anyone else's UGC. It always hung up on me.\n\n04/21 Edit: UGC is still messed up after latest (04/20) patch. Most of the time I can't even see the UGC I made, and I can only see some of what other people made.\n\n----------\n\nI expect to change my review some day, but unless you want to make scenery objects for the game, I'd hold out on buying it right now.","April 11","false","17.8"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I have a computer that runs gta 5 on high graphics at 90 fps yet my computer struggles to reach 40 fps on high graphics on this game. I like the style etc. but the game feels terrible, and i didnt have much fun playing it. The game has crashed on me at least 10 times, usually when i delete a piece of coaster track. However, i really like the rctw coaster builder, and i like that the old method is till there, but it doesnt make up for the pile of s**t the rest of the game is. I think its worth waiting for planet coaster, as it is being made by the same people as rct3. What a shame, and that mostly negative status on here is going to be hard to turn around.

Why? i'll explain...\n\nFirst off, the small little rides you can set up here and there (ferris wheels, gravitron, merry go round, etc) are all nice and work flawlessly... But the moment I try building a  coaster, it just starts eating up SO MUCH MEMORY.\n\nYes, this game uses up so much memory and processing, it's insane. It's definitely NOT optimized what so ever. I'm on a high end computer that can run just about every single game i have on here on max settings with flawless performance... but for some reason, this particular game, whenever I try building a coaster, or even spawn a premade one, it freezes up, crashes, and gives me a warning/error saying that too much memory is being used. Then java stops working, aaaand it dies all together. I learned this the hard way when I was spending a lot of time setting up paths, small rides, concessions, etc... and when i finally said "Alright, i think it's time to build a coaster!" Not even half way done with it, and it froze up and crashed and gave me that error.\n\nAt first I though it was just an instance, so i booted it up again and gave it another go. Same thing. Any time I tried making a coaster,  it just died. So there goes all that time on an unsaved game. Oh yeah, that's another thing. The game doesn't have an autosave feature and I feel that if it's going to crash like this often, it probably should have one.\n\nTo sum it all up...\nIt looks cool and all, but holy hell, it just sucks up so much memory, your computer can't handle it and ends up halting it's processing on it all together automatically. So if you don't have a good computer, a REALLY GOOD COMPUTER, with LOTS of memory, then this game isn't for you.\n\nIt's a shame... I was so excited about this game too. I love the RCT games and have been waiting for this one for years, only to see that it's in no way, shape, or form, ready to be played at all. And judging by what's being discussed by the devs, it's not going to be enjoyable in the years to come. =/","April 26","false","2.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"

It is a complete joke that they would even charge such a ridiculous price for such a game in its current state. I will say that this game is a lot of fun.

Most of the people that are freaking out about it and saying how terrible it is are just not paitent enough to put a little time into and figure out how it works.  Also it's a simulation game for theme parks, not Medal of Honor.  It's a game who's target audience is much younger then most of those playing it right now.  People playing it right now are people that have been playing RCT3 for 10 years, know it backward and forward and were dealing with a game that has three updates.  This is not that yet and if that's what you're looking for then go back to playing RCT3 and stop trying to kill a game that shows a lot of promise, just give it a little time.

This early access is a joke and im personally ashamed of it being a rct game forgive me and all but this game is not worth my time! avoid this game like the plague!

The AI could be better, and the forced tutorial in the campaign is what started to turn me off of this game. It really isn't complicated enough to force something like that. I see where the developers are going, and how they plan to make that leap, but for now it feels like city skylines with rollercoasters. I'll play for a bit longer, and I don't expect rollercoaster tycoon 2 to make a come-back, but the gist of the matter is overcomplication for little pay-off.","March 30","false","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Honestly I know the beta was horrible but this feels even worse than the first beta! Of course it is Early Access but is this all that they've got.

Everytime I click on a flat ride to spawn it in, the game lags for a good 10 seconds and resumes. Hell even coaster building is a huge hassle and it is near impossible to build anything with the difficult controls as well as the horrible optimization issues the game has.

They fixed the memory leak apparently (not), and as a whole its much better than the first beta tests, but the spline-based coaster builder system still needs work.\n\nAlso the heavy contrasted graphics gives me a headache after a few minutes of playing, but maybe that's just me. Apparently they're going for a retro look, but meh.\n\nDon't buy as is. I'm still holding out for the final release, but I'm worried that with the number of times they've pushed this game back with very little improvement, they'll give up on it.\n\nBut hey! At least it's early release, so maybe some good will come from the Steam community\n\nEDIT:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTurns out they didnt fix the memory leak. I spent 3 hours designing a ride only to have my computer run out of RAM and crash, making me lose all my progress. It's still better than the 20 minutes I had to make a ride in the beta, but FFS devs, fix this! Some/most of us are perfectionists who like to make a good ride!\n\nThere's also a painful stutter on turns, and none of the premade rides have any banked turns.\n\nI've been a huge fan of the series, and so far the only "innovative" part they've contibuted with RCTW is the spline-based coaster building, like in NoLimits2. It's pretty powerful, but is plagued by memory leaks, horrible glitchiness, and whatnot.\n\nI like how they added premade track segments like the previous games, but the devs should streamline their use with our freeform manipulation. They're more like a springboard or a guide to the freeform design, but it's impossible to make a decent coaster using the premade track segments alone.\n\nNecessary fixes:\n-Memory leak (maybe an autosave feature that stores your build progress on a file rather than RAM. Seriously devs, how many of your programmers are college graduates? Or competent?)\n-Stuttery on-ride turns\n-a way to remove a twist in the track without rebuilding your entire ride\n-Real-time speed and g-force data on each track segment to help with custom design\n-fix the premade rides\n-streamline/fix the premade track segments\n\nThings they got right:\n-the premade inversions are pretty good\n-stations look better than before\n-Steam workshop seems legit but I haven't worked with it much, due to the aforementioned problems\n\nTL;DR The good points of this game are drowned out by its bugs. The devs should make the coaster builder more like NoLimits2.","March 30","false","15.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Its full of amazing concepts and big ideas and on paper if I had $10,000,0000 I would support it or take the ideas and rebuild it myself. but I dont, but they do and they appear to have made a shambles of it.\n\nI log into steam every day to see if there is an update and I read the blogs with interest, hoping and praying that with each next release its fixed, but its becoming an embarassement to the RCT name. There is so much it could do and so much potential, so much that excites me about it... so much I want it to be... But it just isnt.\n\nI'm hoping that (if the developers dont see sense and fly me out to their offices immediately to help fix their mess) that within 6 months this game is fixed and actually playable. I've tried hard to have an open mind and to make this game playable but it just isnt.\n\nMy advice if you are feeling thrifty this month is to take the money you would have spent on it and give it all to the next homeless person you see, or if you are not that way inclined, buy yourself and the homeless person a pizza with it, because quite frankly, the way it is right now, you'd both be miles better off in life than you would be if you owned this game.\n\nI'm not saying, don't buy it, you may think its great (if you've been living in a cave since 1999) but if you are expecting a game that is better than I could download for free on my phone, then currently you are looking in the wrong place.\n\nMy conclusion you ask?  Is to wait a little and see what happens. I'll keep trying it and if it lives up to my expectations eventually I will recommend you buy it. For now? Stick your credit card back in your wallet, its not even worth the interest let alone the pennies...\n\nThank god for steam, buying it on a DVD would be an insult to the plastic its burnt into!\n\n\n","April 29","false","3.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sure enough, kept crashing.  Can't recommend something that doesn't work.  Got a refund.  Will attempt again if the bugs / crashes are fixed.

I enjoyed playing with the roller coaster editor, however there is one big issue - you cannot build realistc coasters at the moment because the ride physics do not work - the cars do not slow down in a realistic fashion as they travel down the track. Just to see how bad it was, I built a straight track that just kept going back and forth and the coaster train took almost 10 minutes to finally stop moving.  As someone who wanted to use this mostly for the coaster designer, I still cannot recommend this as ride physics are just wrong.

Wow. What an absolute atrocity of a game.\nParks are only big enough to contain one rollercoaster, which are a NIGHTMARE to try and build (They put in a new little piece-by-piece coaster editor since the beta for when the other editor gets on your nerves too much but honestly that may be the only thing about this game that doesn't make me want to rip my hair out, and even IT was put in as an alternative to a feature which evidently even the programmers realized was hugely flawed).\n\nI play a game called Nolimits Coaster, which is a realistic simulator that real world coaster companies use to simulate how their rollercoasters are going to end up looking, and even it is easier to build a rollercoaster in than this game, and the coasters here don't come CLOSE to realistic (and even when I tried to aim for realism, it still said my rides are too intense for some reason, if they didn't just flat out fly off the track)\n\n\nEven putting aside rollercoaster building as a whole due to how terrible they are (despite them arguably being the entire POINT of the Rollercoaster Tycoon series) the game is awful. The flat rides look "whimsical" and pre-themed, which might not bother people who aren't big on theming their own park or having a park that looks realistic, but for coaster nerds like me it's a huge turn-off.\nThe tutorial sort of cut out halfway through, and basically, I stopped playing after an hour and a half so I can immediatly demand my money back and preorder Planet Coaster (A game made by the people who made RCT3, who's ALPHA is currently looking way better than this thing).\n\nI get that MAYBE a part of them was trying to set things straight and give fans the game they wanted, but they ran out of time before they got the chance, but... Man, this is a really bad game. Really bad. They didn't listen to the fans enough, they kept stuff secret for too long, and tried to fix it when they didn't have enough time to. The result is a buggy, hard to play game with missing features.\nIt left me feeling angry and wondering where I put my Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 CD.\n\nI would honestly not be surprised to see that the studio ends up closing after a huge flop such as this. This is a dud the size of which I've seen lead to game or movie studios going bankrupt in the past.","March 30","false","5.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","0"

Upon downloading this game I did have some difficulties getting it to start (This should be fixed by the release) and there are some lag issues.  I believe the lag issues are because of the preset graphics settings for the game during beta.  People are getting all upset about little problem like these that may easily be fixed by an options menu.  It took me about an hour or two to get used to the controls, and before that this game was frustrating and unappealing to me.  After I mastered the controls of this beta the game became much more enjoyable and appealing.  Having played all three of the previous games this one deffinetely seems like it could be a step up in the future.  Many people are rating this entire game off of the first betas seeminly confusing rollercoaster builder.  I gaurentee you a good portion of the negative reviews are people who just cant move there mouse correctly.  After playing this game for 4 hours and recording 3 videos, here is my pros and cons chart.\n\nPros:\n-Great vertex system of building the tracks.\n-New path system is great despite the fact that being symetric is nearly impossible.\n-Graphics are a huge step up from rollercoaster tycoon 3\n-Interface\n-New rollercoaster testing results gui\n\nCons:\n-No options in the first beta (really... this would have fixed a lot of people's problems)\n-No tutorial\n-No way to change or learn controls\n-Overly shaky when riding some rollercoaster (tends to make my head hurt)\n-Peeps sometimes just stop going on your rides (understandable con since the peeps are not finished yet)\n-Coaster Building was the main aspect of this beta, so all of the coaster settings should be available.\n\nOverall, this game is great to play and despite very little being available this beta I have yet to run out of things to do.","October 31, 2015","true","7.9"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"

But remember this is the first beta weekend and we are 2 months away from release. They still have time to bug fix.\n\nThe coaster creation has a very big learning curve because the game takes physics into account. Your coaster will not be able to make sharp hairpin curves, you need to bank your turns, slow the coaster down if its doing 90mph in a turn. This is why people are having issues and why it has such a higher learning curve than the other games. They should give you the option of the current system and the original piece by piece for the inpatient.\n\nContent in the game has all but been locked out for the current beta, because they want feedback on the coaster creation system. If you are patient and enjoyed the older games, then yes I reccomend this game, I loved the wild designs I created in my coasters. But again, it has a learning curve, do not expect to just jump right in and make a great coaster, physics, speed, gravity are now factored in, you are not going to make a turn if your coaster is flying at 100+mph.","October 31, 2015","true","10.4"," 31 of 61 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","31","61","0","1"

It would take at least twice as much development as it currently has to get anywhere close. If you're crazy about theme park simulation games, you might find some enjoyment from it, but let me go over the good and the bad.\n\nPROS:\nNot limited to a tile system like the previous titles\nCoaster builder has piece by piece functionality, although limited\n\nCONS:\nNo piece by piece structure building like in previous titles\nNo water rides, transport rides etc\nCoaster builder is extremely challenging to work with\n--> It uses your camera's orientation and mouse position to orient new nodes\n--> Clicking on a node moves it\n--> Often tells you that smoother curves are impossible and forces bad track design\n--> View of nodes is obstructed when adjustments are deemed illegal, making it hard to fix\n--> No smoothing or straightening track functionality\n--> Coasters don't slow down due to friction as much as you would expect\n--> Coaster supports are unrealistic and don't reappear if removed\n--> Brakes don't work properly, causing coasters to fail\n--> Block brakes don't work properly, and multiple trains often cause coasters to stop working\n--> Height limit is unrealistically low (80m)\nCoaster types\n--> Missing kiddie coaster, wild mouse, corkscrew coaster, looping coaster\n--> Spinning coaster spins irradically, causing high intensity ratings no matter how realistic\n--> Launch coaster catapult is too short and launches to height limit (80m) at slowest setting\nPeeps are not properly implemented\n--> An unrealistic number of peeps visit your park (300+ with just a carousel)\n--> Zooming out causes peeps to turn into a slideshow\n--> Zooming in fully does a weird blur thing (fake DOF?) causing peeps to disappear\n--> Peeps puke, pee, and litter an unrealistic amount, making parks look like garbage\nPaths are difficult to work with and not properly implemented\n--> Snaps to nodes at the center of pathways rather than the outside edges\n--> Ride queues cannot be curved\n--> No stairs\n--> Cannot place stalls/rides right next to the path, must create a short path connecting each\n--> Elevated pathways often clip through the ground\n--> Elevated pathways cannot contain path objects like benches\n--> Connecting to other path nodes can be extremely laggy\nTheming is more limited than previous titles\n--> Restricted to generic, western, sci-fi, adventure\nStaff is poorly implemented\n--> No staff zoning\n--> Staff ignores buildings, fences, etc, preferring to phase through them like ghosts\nDeleting is poorly implemented\n--> No auto delete for scenery when building coasters/paths\n--> Delete tool is extremely laggy when mousing over objects\nFilling in parks with rides causes FPS tanking (I went from 60 to 14 after building 4 coasters)\n\ntl;dr there are more cons than pros\n\nMy recommendation to you is to pre order Planet Coaster while it's only $30. The alpha alone was miles better than RCTW, providing far more content, easy to use controls, and good optimization. Not to mention it's by the studio that made RCT3, so they have experience in this genre and are essentially creating the true successor to the franchise.

I would not buy this game unless something drastic happens.~\n\nI attempted to log onto the forums but conintued to get errors - which is basically what this game is all about so I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nDespite stating "Early Access" we all know RTW was supposed to be released in Dec. I don't mind a delay, but this is still in ALPHA.\n\nAlso before you read on, please understand I play games in Alpha/Beta often and have been in several testing groups. For the price of this game and what I've gotten, I am exceedingly disappointed. I feel like the developers have ruined the RollerCoaster Tycoon brand with this release and calling it "Early Access" was an easy way out. I am so upset about this game it is hard (in this post) to point out the things I like because the bad is just that bad.\n\n1) Making straight paths/lines is annying. You cannot connect to certain areas even if this is room. I see no logical reason as to why this has been implimented. Bad programing or intent, it's just annoying. No one wants to fight with a game over a path.\n\n2) I look under the people tab for their 'thoughts' and get none. Really? How did we miss this? The same applies for structures such as bathrooms/food/etc. I have to go to the main gate to get 'thoughts.' Is this a big deal? Well I'm going to say yes because how am I to tell if I'm doing a good job or not? What do I need to change? or copy because its working?\n\n3) I actually made money too easily. I'm not a great wonder in games, so my first run in Sandbox how am I making a surplus of money when I haven't even learned how to make a straight path yet? Where is the challenge?\n\n4) Stalls that sell items (ie: hats, sunglasses, etc.) have you pick who your customer base should be: kid/teen/adult. I have *no* idea how to pick a group. I have no messages telling me if kids like hats more than adults or if teens want hats. I can't customise like I was able to in the past and make them a color. I can't sell different sizes in the same stall... does this mean I have to buy three of the same type of stall to sell hats to each customer base? In the previous games you didn't have this issue, so why are we beign so silly this time? I loved when I was able to pick how much ice went into my soda (cost v. quality) or if we were going to add toppings. Things have downgraded.\n\n5) Trees. A single tree can block the construction of everything. Stupid. Fine, let's go with it. I can't drag and delete and I have to click and delete each and every tree in my way? Waste of time and annoying. This only (to me) lowers the game quailty and it doesn't increase the challege to the game.\n\n6) I was hoping for new features: hotels that your people can stay at, ads, water parks, animals, a train that takes you around the park. Instead its plop, connect, turn on, go. When you state "Tycoon World" I was expecting advance features, adding more than just the park, being able to do things like never before. So disappointed.\n\n7) Graphics. I'm not a graphics person. I play recent games that have low quality graphics but this is just bad. I can easily play ESO yet my computer lags when playing and the graphics are horrible. This was not shown in the trailers.\n\n\nAll in all, the price is much too high for an "Early Access" game that is most likely going to be a failed game. I don't see that random small updates are going to fix the major problems seen. I haven't even attempted to create a coaster because I felt like it was pointless as I was already rolling in cash.\n\nI was happy to see that the game designers admitted (at first) that the game needed to be worked on. I didn't know how bad it was.\n\n.. and my dear friends - we should all get some money back for this crap. You're going to lose your player base very quickly at this rate.","March 31","false","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you were a fan of old rct do not buy this game. That's the early TL:DR.\n\nHere are the likes\n1. Terrain and water editor is nice\n2. music isn't bad\n3. more coaster editor customization\n\nand dislikes\n1. coaster editor is far too complex for average user, even above average users. See below for more details.\n2. takes way too long to load sandbox mode. SANDBOX MODE!\n3. can't right click to delete things such as pathways\n4. MUST move camera with arrow keys, no more mouse movement\n5. None of the coaster styles have relevant pictures to determine what they are, only stick figure sillouhetes.\n6. you don't have a setting to remove cars from your trains. To add you simply click on where the extra cars should be\n7. Terrain editor wont change the already existing support height leaving terrain indents that are quite ugly\n8. Scenery isn't separated by group anymore. Oregon Trail Wagons apparently fit in with UFO's and pumpkins.\n\nHere is my report of my experience on coastercrazy.com's forum skype chat regarding the game:\n- alright rctw gimme what you got\n- the music reminds me of a mix between sims 3 and a merry go round\n- really not sure why a sandbox mode took MY $3000 custom build 2 minutes to load\n- why can't I right click to delete things?\n- can't move the camera with mouse apparently even with the highly unnecessary "move tool". you need to use the arrow keys, something never needed before. WHAT AN AWESOME NEW FEATUJRE GUISE! [/sarcasm]\n- None of the coaster styles have relevant pictures to determine what they are, only stick figure sillouhetes.\n- wow the coaster editor... take everything you knew about rct and throw it out the window.\n- make a kiddie coaster. A good looking kiddie coaster. What was a 3 minute build is now 15 minutes.\n- this coaster editor is way too complex for any casual or even a step above that user\n- it's so customizable but that doesn't mean better. Sure it'll be able to make somewhat realistic coasters even WITHOUT A STRAIGHT TRACK SETTING AT ALL but it won't be recieved well by anyone that wants a casual non stressful experience.\n- as far as track is concerned imagine a spline editor that automatically detects radius\n- they took a simple game idea and added infinitely more steps\n- on the bright side making death coasters is way easier\n- For extra ride settings, you don't have a setting to remove cars from your trains. To add you simply click on where the extra cars should be.\n- THIS IS NOT ROLLER COASTER TYCOON!\n- I love this new terrain editor I do but it wont change the already existing support height leaving terrain indents that are quite ugly.\n- The water tool works very well and something I really like.\n- Scenery isn't separated by group anymore. Oregon Trail Wagons apparently fit in with UFO's and pumpkins.\n- Overall a very sub par experience, definitely should not be named under roller coaster tycoon.","October 31, 2015","false","3.8"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

I'll change this review later if the game redeems itself, but for now, there's just too much to be disappointed with. This is currently not looking to be the fun the first three games were.\n\nFirst off, the coaster editor.\nYes, it's a spline based system which means more flexibility in how you can design your coaster, but it also means more weirdness.

Now it's time to test it. Which, by the way, you can't do while paused. Perhaps it'll crash into one of the nodes mysteriously left by the editor that didn't get removed. All right, it's a beta, weird things happen. Next run, it'll pass through it just fine, only to clip into the track and crash a bit before the station.

FIrst of all I played what they called the 'beta' back in november which was a huge disappointment. I couldn't even start the game or it would crash and if it did start it would crash after a few minutes of play time.\n\nNow, that is the only possitive thing I could say about this game atm; it didn't crashed (at least for me). Besides that this is the most expensive early access game I have ever seen and bought and also the most awfull one.\n\nThe graphics look like crap. When you zoom out you will notice a square box which is around half of the size of the screen in which all the graphics are rendered, and outside of this box everything looks different/vague. Also the peeps are very pixely and walk like a bunch of idiots.\n\nThe interface is just as annoying and malfunctioning as in the 'beta'. Buttons and sliders that won't work and even in the graphics tab it's hard to get to 2560x1440 because it's outside of the settings box.\n\nBoth the road builder as the coaster builder are also buggy as hell as, for instance, it is nearly impossible to connect a waiting line and a exit nicely next to eachother to your main path.\n\nI would understand if you would say 'Hey, why be so hard on the devs this is an early access game!', but this 1.2GB game they delivered to us all for $45 doesn't even deserve to be called a beta, let alone be called an early access. I believe the devs should be ashamed of the state this game is in and how little they seemed to have learned from the 'pre-pre-alpha' last november. At least I'm done with this game and getting my refund to save the money for a game that is worth the money.","March 30","false","3.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Now, 4 month after the planned release an only one beta-weekend later they sell this title as early access. At first they must have known in the beginning of december that they wont release the game in 2015, the beta was terrible. Sadly there are almost no noticable improvements over the beta. The performance is bad, graphics are bad, the UI looks like it was made in 5 minutes with MS Paint and the overall content is underwhelming and unpolished. The path system is unintuitive, just like the coaster builder. The animations are horrible, Peeps in RCT3 still have more beauty to them than in this so called game. I did not test the economy in this title - I just coul not force me to play this game longer than I did. It is just terrible.\n\nAtari lied several times.

I would not buy this game unless something drastic happens.~\n\nI attempted to log onto the forums but conintued to get errors - which is basically what this game is all about so I shouldn't be surprised.\n\nDespite stating "Early Access" we all know RTW was supposed to be released in Dec. I don't mind a delay, but this is still in ALPHA.\n\nAlso before you read on, please understand I play games in Alpha/Beta often and have been in several testing groups. For the price of this game and what I've gotten, I am exceedingly disappointed. I feel like the developers have ruined the RollerCoaster Tycoon brand with this release and calling it "Early Access" was an easy way out. I am so upset about this game it is hard (in this post) to point out the things I like because the bad is just that bad.\n\n1) Making straight paths/lines is annying. You cannot connect to certain areas even if this is room. I see no logical reason as to why this has been implimented. Bad programing or intent, it's just annoying. No one wants to fight with a game over a path.\n\n2) I look under the people tab for their 'thoughts' and get none. Really? How did we miss this? The same applies for structures such as bathrooms/food/etc. I have to go to the main gate to get 'thoughts.' Is this a big deal? Well I'm going to say yes because how am I to tell if I'm doing a good job or not? What do I need to change? or copy because its working?\n\n3) I actually made money too easily. I'm not a great wonder in games, so my first run in Sandbox how am I making a surplus of money when I haven't even learned how to make a straight path yet? Where is the challenge?\n\n4) Stalls that sell items (ie: hats, sunglasses, etc.) have you pick who your customer base should be: kid/teen/adult. I have *no* idea how to pick a group. I have no messages telling me if kids like hats more than adults or if teens want hats. I can't customise like I was able to in the past and make them a color. I can't sell different sizes in the same stall... does this mean I have to buy three of the same type of stall to sell hats to each customer base? In the previous games you didn't have this issue, so why are we beign so silly this time? I loved when I was able to pick how much ice went into my soda (cost v. quality) or if we were going to add toppings. Things have downgraded.\n\n5) Trees. A single tree can block the construction of everything. Stupid. Fine, let's go with it. I can't drag and delete and I have to click and delete each and every tree in my way? Waste of time and annoying. This only (to me) lowers the game quailty and it doesn't increase the challege to the game.\n\n6) I was hoping for new features: hotels that your people can stay at, ads, water parks, animals, a train that takes you around the park. Instead its plop, connect, turn on, go. When you state "Tycoon World" I was expecting advance features, adding more than just the park, being able to do things like never before. So disappointed.\n\n7) Graphics. I'm not a graphics person. I play recent games that have low quality graphics but this is just bad. I can easily play ESO yet my computer lags when playing and the graphics are horrible. This was not shown in the trailers.\n\n\nAll in all, the price is much too high for an "Early Access" game that is most likely going to be a failed game. I don't see that random small updates are going to fix the major problems seen. I haven't even attempted to create a coaster because I felt like it was pointless as I was already rolling in cash.\n\nI was happy to see that the game designers admitted (at first) that the game needed to be worked on. I didn't know how bad it was.\n\n.. and my dear friends - we should all get some money back for this crap. You're going to lose your player base very quickly at this rate.","March 31","false","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fans of the franchise will buy the game no matter what; like me. This is of course a beta. The most disappointing thing for me in the beta is the coaster builder. Why? It's not because its so cluncy or problematic. These can be improved. So what is the problem? The problem is how the game is demonstrated for 2-3 months. And when it came to beta; they said that there will only be coaster builder in the first beta, because other parts are not ready enough. So I'm really worried about the other parts of the game; and the whole game itself. If the ready parts is this; (as the developer saying) than it won't be a good game. What I understand from ready is; fluent, not so buggy, and acceptable performance. There is no fluency or ease when building a coaster. If you manage to finish one; and this one would not be the one in your dreams; making it work is another hassle.\n\nI hope the developer work hard and finish this game.

What was a 3 minute build is now 15 minutes.\n- this coaster editor is way too complex for any casual or even a step above that user\n- it's so customizable but that doesn't mean better. Sure it'll be able to make somewhat realistic coasters even WITHOUT A STRAIGHT TRACK SETTING AT ALL but it won't be recieved well by anyone that wants a casual non stressful experience.\n- as far as track is concerned imagine a spline editor that automatically detects radius\n- they took a simple game idea and added infinitely more steps\n- on the bright side making death coasters is way easier\n- For extra ride settings, you don't have a setting to remove cars from your trains.

FIrst of all I played what they called the 'beta' back in november which was a huge disappointment. I couldn't even start the game or it would crash and if it did start it would crash after a few minutes of play time.\n\nNow, that is the only possitive thing I could say about this game atm; it didn't crashed (at least for me). Besides that this is the most expensive early access game I have ever seen and bought and also the most awfull one.\n\nThe graphics look like crap. When you zoom out you will notice a square box which is around half of the size of the screen in which all the graphics are rendered, and outside of this box everything looks different/vague. Also the peeps are very pixely and walk like a bunch of idiots.\n\nThe interface is just as annoying and malfunctioning as in the 'beta'. Buttons and sliders that won't work and even in the graphics tab it's hard to get to 2560x1440 because it's outside of the settings box.\n\nBoth the road builder as the coaster builder are also buggy as hell as, for instance, it is nearly impossible to connect a waiting line and a exit nicely next to eachother to your main path.\n\nI would understand if you would say 'Hey, why be so hard on the devs this is an early access game!', but this 1.2GB game they delivered to us all for $45 doesn't even deserve to be called a beta, let alone be called an early access. I believe the devs should be ashamed of the state this game is in and how little they seemed to have learned from the 'pre-pre-alpha' last november. At least I'm done with this game and getting my refund to save the money for a game that is worth the money.","March 30","false","3.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

At first they must have known in the beginning of december that they wont release the game in 2015, the beta was terrible. Sadly there are almost no noticable improvements over the beta. The performance is bad, graphics are bad, the UI looks like it was made in 5 minutes with MS Paint and the overall content is underwhelming and unpolished.

So let's get to it.\n\nBoth Rollercoaster Tycoon World (RCTW) and Planet Coaster (PC) are halfway through their alpha stages (or beta, the difference in meaning has become insignificant over the last years) and both games show great promises and annoying bugs at the same time, which is completely normal for any game under development of course. PC has just seen the release of its second alpha (the second out of three) and RCTW has had major and minor updates over the last two months, since it has entered early access on Steam. Let's start with pointing out what PC delivers and lacks at this point in time.\n\nPC is a game which features a more or less cartoonic graphic style and is mainly focused on building custom scenery and constructions by using various structural elements and decorative items. This way no two parks will look the same and the possibilities are numerous (not endless, as that's technically impossible), especially with the latest update in which it has been made a lot easier to fine tune the movement of objects on multiple axes. The amount of different structural elements to obtain such a desired beautiful park is quite decent, although it remains to be seen how many will still be added in the future before its final release in autumn 2016, as the amount of newly added objects was amazing during the first alpha, but rather disappointing in the second. Another main focus within the game is the animations of the park guests. These are far from optimal at this point, but it's obvious to see that the creators tend to accomplish guests who accurately reflect their mood, appear to be responsive to their environment (including the rides of course) and behave as natural as possible. This feature still needs development, but it's too soon to tell whether they succeeded or failed, as the park management (which includes this feature as far as I'm concerned) will be released in the third alpha stage next summer, so I will leave this part of the consideration for now. Moving on to the flat rides it seems the developers were bereft of any resourcefulness, as most rides are mere copies of previous rollercoaster tycoon games (RCT 1, 2 and 3) and in the second alpha they even added a second Ferris' Wheel, whereas one would have been more than enough (and don't forget that another flat ride - the Whirley Rig - is also a Ferris' wheel to tell the truth). Is it really that hard to come up with rides that are actually different from predecessors and at least somewhat different from other rides? Let me give you another example: the newly added Insanity ride is just a copy from previous rollercoaster tycoon games and it's also remarkably similar to the Hammer Swing. Why don't they add rides which they've actually come up themselves instead of merely copying others and/or existing rides (just compare the Brain Surge from Nickelodeon Universe to the Psychola ride in the game). To be fair, the same mistake was made with the development of RCTW, as they added two slides (whereas one would have been more than sufficient) and they failed to provide rides which are different and interesting enough from my perspective, just as the developers of PC did. The number of flatrides is still quite low within both games, but I'm sure this will improve on both fronts. Finally, let's move on to my biggest disappointment of PC: the coaster builder. It contains some nice features, such as being able to change colours of the tracks and the supports (although the colours of the carts can't be changed for some unknown reason) and there's a good amount and variety of coaster types, but the building itself is downright frustrating and tedious, as you constantly have to move the cursor from the screen to the interface at the bottom of the screen and back again to build track sections. The building process is also rigid and doesn't feel natural due to a lack of flexibility and a poorly designed interface. This feature has barely been improved upon since the release of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 in 2004, which is clearly an impairment in this game. The second alpha delivered us the finished coaster builder according to the developers, so apparently they deem it to be completed.\n\nLet's now move on to RCTW. This game features a style similar to parks like Six Flags or Hersheypark (as opposed to PC which is more in the direction of Disneyland or Disney World) and is mainly focused on the coaster builder, although various flatrides and scenery items have been included of course. The coaster builder is not perfect (which will be improved in upcoming updates), but building coasters has quite a natural and flexible feel to it, does possess a good interface to make use of all the different functions the spline based building tool has to offer and provides the option to change colours as well. This feature has clearly been improved upon since its last installment of 2004, whereas PC failed to do this. On the other hand, the flexibility and possibilities PC offers for scenery items and custom constructions are not included in RCTW, as the latter does provide a freeform placement system, but is not aimed at allowing players to make their own buildings within the game at this point in time. This feature will be added to the game later on, probably once the game is pulled out of Early Access, which will happen given the amount of regular updates since its release (although many claimed it never would). Moreover, the animation of the peeps (park guests) is fairly poor in RCTW in comparison to PC. They behave and move unnaturally and need quite a few improvements, but the developers are still working on this. My aforementioned criticism on the flatrides also applies to RCTW. Several other missing features are more striking in both games, however, as both games don't include water, dark or transport rides (although both the developing teams promised to add these to the final product of games) and both games don't contain any kind of weather system or simulation (this feature has been promised for RCTW, but not for PC at the moment).\n\nSo, which game would I recommend to you ? Both, as long as the promises that have been made regarding both games are met. Which game should you buy? That's up to you (I bought both games). To me it all comes down to preferences. Do you prefer a theme park builder which mainly focuses on beautiful scenery items and custom buildings just like Disney World, then go for Planet Coaster. If the building of amazing coasters and parks such as Six Flags is more to your liking, then go for Rollercoaster Tycoon World. I truly believe that both games are on the same level at this point in time, as both contain both good and bad features and both offer promises and bugs, which is utterly normal for games under development (as I already said). Let's hope that we will have two good theme park building games coming out at the end of this year.","May 24","true","89.8"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","7","14","2","1"

When I changed the incline so it would not loop it twisted the track in the process. When I tried to tried to move my cursor to straight out the track it made the track appear on the other side of the map.\n\nThen when I tested the failure of a track the new trains kept crashing into the old trains that would not go away. That little piece is beside the point. The point of the weekend one beta according to their FAQ was to show off the new coaster builder. It says on their FAQs that all of the possible coasters are unlocked. I put in my request for a refund because the coaster building tool is so bad that I will have to wait for reviews on the game's coaster builder before re-purchasing this game.

It is following the beta weekend review.\n\nBETA WEEKEND 1What do I think of Roller Coaster Tycoon World? I was hoping it would be great and wow everyone, but this game is never going to be ready by the posted release date, if the roller coaster module is anything to go by. In attempting to build a wooden roller coaster (simple enough, right?) I never once was able to complete a circuit with the train. The physics engine in this is horrible, and if I try to make a tight turn with banking, the only think i ever see is 'SLOPE TOO STEEP'. I think I hate this game. Absolutely hate it. I know the devs are desparate to make some money on this, but this game is not okay. Unless the second beta is better, I'm going to be one of many thousands who return their pre-release orders.\n\nSO MANY DERAILMENTS!!! (literaly)\n\nEarly Access: Day 1In my first experience with the now long-term beta of this game, I must say it's really in need of optimizations. As of right now, this game is still not ready for a full release (thank goodness they went EA if they HAD to release it now, but they could have waited...). So, how has the fourth installment of the Roller Coaster Tycoon franchise fared? Not as well as I'd hoped.\n\nThe Graphics\nThey're not bad, but they're not good either. Visually, they're very pleasing. However, the peeps are flat skins (clothing is not a separate layer) which is disillusioning. In addition, the feel of the ride textures leave the tiniest bit of nagging that something's missing. Overall, though, the graphics are actually very good to look at. BUT, good luck getting a good framerate even with a Titan. The game set my settings on high and I run a GTX 970. There is 1 setting above that which a single GTX 980 or Titan should be capable of running at 60 fps. For the graphics, to be honest, I'm surprised my computer couldn't run 60 fps.\nThere is a plus, though. Since the devs know framerate is bad, they went and added a tickbox that reduces the graphics demand in favor of a more playable framerate, so that you almost never dip below 20 fps. Almost. When building new things in a park that already is a bit crowded, you can dip down all the way to the 1-3 fps region.\n\nGameplay\nWell, it definitely feels like a more open and controllable world than previous RCT games. Because nothing is stuck to the grid, a whole new variety of layout options become available. That said, because of the size of the park, a whole lot of creativity has been thrown out the window. It would take dozens of this park to fill the parks you built in RCT 1-3. This park is only big enough to house 1 large coaster or 2 smaller ones (what the ♥♥♥♥, right?), in addition to your arsenal of small rides needed to keep the less extreme peeps happy. Speaking of those peeps, the way they scream when on a ride is all at once, so you just have an occasional scream that hurts your ears instead of constant enjoyment from your peeps.\n\nBuilding Tools\nThe path and stall building tools are fairly intuitive. With the freeform option, you draw in any direction you like. With the grid turned on, you can keep everything aligned to a coordinate system (perpendicular and parallel to the park entrance, mind you). With snap turned on (this will turn off grid, and vice versa), you can place your paths at 90 degree angles to each other, even if they're not on the grid angle. It also allows for a few other things, like placing stalls directly onto existing paths, and more controllably placing trees and other objects adjacent to paths. All in all, having the three building modes is very useful, but I would like a localized grid aligned with a path I just drew if I had both grid and snap enabled. That would be very useful.\n\nSpecific Building Tools:\nThe path building tool - While this tool is great for building paths on the ground, you don't have nearly enough control with the path height. The only interval for heigh is 7 feet, which is too much, especially given the small spacing the grid has.\nThe Flat Ride Building Tool - Well, it's just placement and angle rotation. On the other hand, unlike in previous RCT games, you can't choose the locations for the entrance and exit to the ride, which was part of how we were able to tightly pack tons of rides into a small space in the last games. And given how much smaller this game's parks are, we really need as much control of the arrangement as possible.\nRoller Coaster Building Tool - The roller coaster building tool really isn't bad anymore. Unlike in the beta weekend, coasters no longer crash for no reason, and the tool is relatively intuitive. That said, the station platforms are very sparse in selection and have MASSIVE footprints. There's already a significant queue and a horrendously long exit walk for every single station platform. And you can't pick where the entrance and/or exit come from, or the direction of the train. Also, track banking doesn't actually listen to what you say. For example, if I have a tight turn on an incline with steep banking, the track is actually rendered as flat and level. Decrease the banking, and the track banks outward (why?). Most of the time, using the building tools is fairly intutive. You have pre-built segments that you can adjust the scale of, or you can click on the ground away from nodes and build your own track. Working with nodes is intutive, but not getting to node mode. If you make a mistake, I have no clue how to abort the new piece without quitting the editor entirely. But on the plus side, you can create and delete nodes in the middle of the track without disconnecting it all. Overall, it still needs a bit of work, but coasters don't crash for no reason, and using it is largely intutive.\n\nConclusionThis game is labeled appropriately as something that's in Early Access. It's glitchy somewhat, and some of the controls don't feel quite finished. That said, there are other problems with this game. Flat rides don't have configurable exits, roller coaster stations are massive and just as unconfigurable (and lacking in variety), and the park size is WAY TOO ♥♥♥♥ING TINY! Will Atari and Nvizzio Creations pull it all together? Maybe. I wouldn't put any money on it happening this year. I would LOVE for them to pull it together and give us something amazing as though they've been holding out, but it really doesn't seem like RCT is on top any more. Planet Coaster, even being in alpha, is already incredibly customizable, allowing for every building to be custom made, a huge park size, and lots more detail. On top of that they're the brains behind RCT3 who did a very good job for the first 3D implementation of the series(no offense, Nvizzio). I expect a lot more from Planet Coaster in the near and far future than I do from Roller Coaster Tycoon World. For now, I'm getting my refund.","October 31, 2015","false","1.7"," 31 of 63 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","31","63","4","0"

Having played both Planet Coaster and RCTW, I really cannot understand how so many have the gift of projecting what one game will become and the other won't. Admirable! I certainly don't have that divine ability of reading into the future. In all honesty, they are both in early development and one has as much potential as the other. I must say that RCTW has absolutely delivered what they have announced for this milestone, and it's not bad considering this stage of development. In other words, they have been true to their word and that's a plus in Early Access. Everything depends on how it will evolve from here on (and this goes for both games). Lots can still be done and devs have a good blueprint with which to work.\n\nPerformance and stability must be enhanced. AI and balancing (namely for the coaster testing  indices, finances and management) need adjusting. Peeps need more personality, humor, player interaction, and better graphics/animation. UI could also use polishing. The rest is added content and more options. All these points have been addressed since this first Early Access release. Despite all this, for me the game is playable and fun. A handful of coasters, stalls, services, management and a good sized surface area (you can unlock areas around your initial park land) are there to play around with. Only the future will tell if RCTW or PC win the race. At this point 6/10.","March 30","true","21.7"," 28 of 57 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","28","57","0","9"

The thrill of that game still excites me, even 2 and 3 are designed the same as the Original Game. This however is not, atleast not yet. The game is still an Early Release, that being said its just a slight step above being termed a official beta. There is alot of good aspects to this game, the coaster design system being one major possitive note. The major negavitve atm would prob have to be the pathing system, its not as clear as 1-3 was, however you can make diaganal paths which i dont recall being able to back then. So for paths its a improvement that just needs further mechanics to par with the mechanics of either previous gens of RCT or just something all together more modern. The game will take alittle adjusting to if/when compared to previous versions. While alot of people have given it a bad review and i could imagine asked for a refund, I am not going to do that. I will admit i did consider it. I also know as the improvements get implemented I would want to play it again and rebuy it. I also would like to see firsthand the improvements and modifications to a series I grew up enjoying. In the end my review might not be the most helpful because while i give the game a thumbs up, it is a early release and I could respect peoples opion to not like the game. But those of you who grew up with this series like I did might find a appreciation in seeing its future unfold.","March 31","true","19.7"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","18","37","0","0"

That being said, I know there are a lot of things that are still sketchy with RCTW.  I was not fortunate enough to have been able to play this during Beta.  However, I wish people would not be so impatient and give it a chance.  I realize RCTW was in the works for a VERY long time and I was one of the people who was very much looking forward to its release.  I think for an Early Access game, it's quite good!  Some of the best games I have played have been Early Access games and while they were a bit low grade at their release, they are absolutely amazing now!  I believe RCTW has more than enough potential to be one of those games.  The devs did state that some things were limited due to the fact that it is Early Access and that they are still putting work into it.  There are definitely some graphical issues that need to be worked through and I would like to see the ability to change the colors of rides and incorporate our own music.  I can also see the some minor glitches in free form tracks and paths where it is difficult to create the exact shape that you want.  However, I feel that overall, it is a wonderful game!  I am really shocked at all the negative Early Access feedback.  It's EARLY ACCESS!  Meaning.....the devs want to know what the community wants to see done to create a better gaming experience.  They don't want a bunch of nasty comments about how their product was a flop and you should just go play some other rollercoaster game.  That is not at all constructive.\n\nAnyway, yes, I would highly recommend this game and if you go into it with an open mind, looking at its future potential and not its current failures, then I think you will have a lot of fun!","March 30","true","6.5"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

There are top rated reviews that have nothing about the actual game, so I figured I would write my own.\n\nMy first thoughts 7+ hours into playing this early access build of RCTW are that I am rather enjoying it and cannot wait to see what the devs add on! Here are the pros and what needs work through early access, I'd rather not consider them cons yet as they can be fixed.\n\nPROS:Once you spend some time going through the tutorial, building becomes easier and easier.  I had a few issues at first jumping in, but once I took the time to go through the tutorial, most, if not all of my issues were solved and made easier.\nThe social hub is a nice feature and easy to share blueprints for coasters.  My girlfriend is far better at building coasters than I, and I was able to grab her builds from here.  There were also others in the larger community that caught my eye.  Plenty of talented people out there and awesome to be able to use their coasters.\nScenario modes are awesome! I like the variety of different problems the player has to solve in the different scenario options.\nThe U.I. is nice throughout and clean!  Always know where to click for what I want.  No confusion even from when I first started.\nGame ran well on my Laptop which has a tendency to overheat with most games.  I see people listing better specs than I, but claiming their performance was poor.  Perhaps they should adjust their settings, because I'm wondering how in the world they had bad performance.  There is an occaisonal fps drop, but it was rare.  Probably something that will eventually be optimized by the developers completely.  No where near unplayable as some of these reviews would have you believe.  Trust me, I'm on my laptop. It's fine!\nGood amount of pre-built coasters and rides.  I expected the early access title would have less, but there is plenty to choose from.  That isn't counting the social hub and custom builds.\nOptions were good.  Can adjust various audio levels, graphics,etc.  There are even options to favor fps over graphics if you should need that for your set-up.\nNotifications can act as a "to-do" list that you can easily clear or X out one by one.  It let me know when there was something I could be doing better in my park.WHAT COULD BE FIXED IN EARLY ACCESS:like with most early access titles, you can expect some bugs.  The main ones I ran into were peeps sliding rather than walking on occaison.  Peeps in general could use more work.  They would have strange graphical glitches within the riding cameras on most rides.\nSetting theme music on rides could sometimes overlap with other rides' music and create messy music.  I guess in a way it makes sense, but I wish this was more seamless.\nNausea levels could be tweaked on the peeps.\nSome odd instances where rides or peeps & staff will stop working for a moment.  Fixes itself within a minute or so.\nOverall, I would recommend RCTW.  I enjoyed the previous titles, and this one is fun and easy to jump right into.  Though in early access, it is more put together than many tycoon games. If the devs continue being passionate about this game and listening to the community, which it seems they will, this will be an amazing title!","April 4","true","7.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

It SEEMS to lock up when trying to load anything.  BUT if you play a video on youtube in the background or have anything else that is constantly moving the cpu forward then the game loads and runs like a dream.\n\nPaths can be better. It seems that they are too clunky. I want square paths as a design.  Gaining money seems slow too. The alert system is in your face all the time. Slow it down a bit or make the notification smaller.  Let us set an unspecified chain speed. Or lets us hire more than 3 maintence at the start. Even when i had minimal coasters they couldnt keep up with puke. Area to build park should be 3-5 times larger to start with. One time coaster takes up a third of the map. paths take up another....soooo stalls and crap for the other third and you are kinda maxed out.\n\nI want a highlight delete tool. A highlight terrain modifier for flat options.\n\nNeed way more graphics options.  Need a way to set view distance and different shadow qualities.  Will be updating as i see what else.\n\nEarly access is nice...But the game wasnt even close to done.   Maybe at a beta standpoint.  NEEDS some work with everything. Maybe make it clear that you are going to be spending quite some time on the game. because everyone thinks that you guys might cut and run. They want assurance They want to know that you guys are making the game becasue you are fans too and are not there becasue you have to be. That has to come across. More nuance is needed in telling people what you are trying to do.

So many people forget or don't realise that Nvizzio have only been working on this for about 18 months or so, proir to this 2 others had tried and failed, so there was and still is a LOT of work to be done before the masses get a finished product. This isn't something that will happen quickly either.\nAt the moment it needs a speccy PC to run too, as it uses rather a lot of memory at the moment. Some users report upto 8Gb of RAM being used by just this game alone. Yes there are a lot of features this game doesn't have yet but these things will come, in time. And Devs are listening to the community feedback and more importantly, doing something about the problems being reported. They are doing Bi-weekly updates on the game, with a live stream to showcase the update content just a few days prior to each one. They too, like us want this game to be the awesome game we all know it can be. I am hopefull they can pull this off and will stick with it all the way through development.\n\nSo, to recap.\nIn my honest opinion its a good game. Yes it has quirks at the moment and there's a few glitch's here and there and the massive memory usage. But I am enjoying it and creating some wonderfull parks with some awesome coasters. I would recommend to others to play, but bare in mind this game has a long way to go and its not perfect at the moment. This is still an Early Access game.","May 22","true","331.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","1"

Very different from the previous games. A bit more difficult, so not sure how that will go for new coaster players. Its obviously a very early build though, so interested to see in the next beta build and release. This build you can only build a rollercoaster and no flat rides, no pees..just ghosts. Trees in the distance outside the park look probably worse than other games. The design of the coaster is difficult but it does give the opportunity to create much more free form rides and more options, especially when specialty tracks are added (hopefully in next beta). its a quick beta...im not recommending the beta...but i can see the game will be great and what i have hoped for, that is what i recommend.","October 31, 2015","true","9.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It looks really pretty but that's really all it seems to have to offer. As many others who played the first "beta"-weekend says: the coaster editor is a mess. It's hard to use, making cool functional roller-coasters is impossible, nothing really works and building is no fun at all. I really like the concept of spline based building but right now I prefer the old style building as that was FUN.\n\nEven if you look past all the bugs that makes your game crash and the loading times that take forever it's still way behind it's predecessors. And calling this weekend a "beta" weekend is a bit of a joke as well, as the game feels more like an alpha or even pre-alpha game looking at it's current near unplayable condition.\n\nI'm not a big fan of the UI either. The old UI's made the game look fun and it was easy to understand. In this game it feels like they were trying to be "modern" and not looking into what the fans liked about the previous games. It's really just SimCity all over again...\n\nI did like the terrain editor though. Playing with water is super fun, but is it worth 46€? No.\n\nI say that if you really want to try this game like I did, wait for the full relase and listen to what the reviews has to say by then. Hopefully the devs will clean this mess up but I doubt they will in only 2 months of time...","October 31, 2015","false","1.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I'm unimpressed with the pre-order Beta weekend. The game seems far from finished (although due to be released in a little over a month),\n\nThe game ran very slowly on my machine (8gb ram), though I was one of the fortunate ones that didn't have continuous crashing problems. The beta was limited to a very small portion of the game content and limited to two weekends of play between now and release. Overall the user interface felt laggy and clunky. The coaster builder was interesting but riddled with bugs and physics issues. Building a complete coaster that wasn't simply a lift, drop and circle back to the station was almost constantly met with incredible frustration. (And I'm not new to the genre, I still play RCT3 and building coasters is my favorite aspect of the game)\n\nI am quite surprised by this beta release. I expected a nearly completed game, a smooth and lag free engine and an exciting preview of what awaited the final release. Instead it was an unfnished  mess of problems that felt like a very limited alpha test. I have requested a refund and will wait to see what the reviews are like after the game releases in December before deciding to purchase or not.","October 31, 2015","false","1.6"," 56 of 114 people (49%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","49","56","114","4","0"

The roller coasters are trickier to make, and they are full of bugs. It lacks charm, or any of the draw of its predecessors. The pathway tools are incredibly frustrating. What features there are, are incredibly limited, even giving it the benefit of the doubt of its early access status. The game never crashed for me, but the gameplay itself is at best glitchy, and at worst, they make the game unplayable. Taking into consideration the repeated times the game was pushed back for release and its steep price, I can say with all confidence that even one after more glitches have been cleared, it is not a game worth buying.","April 19","false","12.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I played all of the previous titles of the series and loved every second of them. But when I started to play this, I felt so disappointed.\n\nI have a GTX 980. Why am I getting such low framerates with graphics that are so blurry? Take the peeps and workers for example; their textures are pretty hideous. The flat rides flooring doesn’t even match my current path designs. RCT3 managed to do this so why can’t this?\n\nI was so excited for the scenarios and when I played them, it wasn’t enjoyable compared to how the scenarios worked in the previous titles. In RCT3 for example; had custom entrances, descriptive objectives on a simple UI objective board. But in this game, every scenario has the same entrance on all three levels with only a terrain change and has simple objectives with ugly white UI. I had to go back to RCT3 and RCT2 and play those scenarios again.\n\nI say don’t buy this game now. Wait a few months/year. There are other coaster tycoon games that are currently being developed. Planet Coaster for people who enjoyed Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 (which is in early alpha and it’s prettier than this. However, Planet Coaster Alpha costs £49.) and for people who enjoyed RCT1 and RCT2 there is Parkitect (Alpha cost £15). Those two games are shaping up to be great coaster games. I suggest following their progress.","March 30","false","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Everyone of them talks about planet coaster,  a game that isn't even out yet but still people talk it up as if they've played it. I will also be getting planet coaster day one but It is not fair to this dev team who has obviously worked very hard on this.. Plus it is early access!\n\nI'll start by saying I did not buy this for $50,  I got it for $20 so that definitely helps make it more positive for me and I believe it's important for me to note that.\n\nI am running a GTX 980, i7, 32gb ram... I have yet to run into any major optimization issues. I have the graphic settings maxed out,  the game looks great and runs great. I really like the lighting at night.  If you're running on a much older machine and complaining about optimization issues then you just need to stop and git gud.\n\nI don't believe half these reviews on here...Many of the negative reviews have less then an hour played on them or they're from the beta..\n\nGamers now a days hate on anything and everything. Seems people can't enjoy anything for themselves, so they jump on the hate train. Its very evident when half the negative reviews have the same language. Its truly sad. When it comes to this,  PC gamers have always been the worst.\n\nThis is an early access game and for what it is now,  I think its great and is only going to get better. The development team has already posted a day after release about upcoming updates directly addressing players complaints. I hope they plan on releasing a ton of content. Maybe even some freebies for us early access folks.\n\nI'm loving it so far.. I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first two RCT games.

Sadly its still not enough to elevate it up to the standards set by Planet Coaster - now that alpha i am enjoying immensely.\nFirstly this just doesnt "feel" like a Rollercaster Tycoon game. Yes the rides are very detailed close up and the scenery is lovely but it feels too cold and sterile graphics wise. RCT3 looks better in some ways than this.\nThe game ran fine until i plopped down a premade coaster to see what it looks like and my framerate just took a nose dive then crashed even though im on a pretty decent gaming machine.\nRCTW doesnt feel intuitive, even following the tutorials i found myself getting frustrated with some of the basic things like laying paths and placing scenery.\nNow onto coaster building - yes  previous feedback has been taken into account and acted on but its still counter intuitive to build a decent coaster, and lets be honest its why most of us are trying the early access out.\nDespite the negative points i feel there is a decent game buried in there, i think the developers still have a lot of work to do though in getting this upto scratch never mind acheiving the standard set by Planet Coaster.\nAs things stand if i had to recommend either RCTW or Planet Coaster id have to say get Planet Coaster. Im not asking for a refund - i have enough faith that a decent game can be made out of this. Lets hope the devs are taking notes of our feedback and make some much needed improvements.\n13/4/2016 After a patch or two the game is starting to look more promising, the path laying system is still a bit of a nuisance but clearly has been worked on and theres been a number of cosmetic improvements so visually the games looking much better. Ive spent the evening making a basic park..theres a few moments where im left scratching my head (why arent mechanics fixing my rides!) but overall its coming along nicely. im hoping that theres a horror theme added as that was my goto in RCT3.I think as it stands PC still has the edge over RCTW but i am finding lots to like and have changed my recommendation to give a positive. Like i said, theres a good game here, just needs polished.\n23/5/2016 More work under the hood and this game is coming along nicely, alot of bugs and issues are being addressed. I feel its important to keep updating this review as the developers are clearly working hard to get this game upto scratch.

After launching the game for the first time, it immediately crashed during the loading screen. That’s definitely not a great start to a beta. The game is riddled with bugs that make the game unplayable. So far, this game isn’t even up to the quality of early-access alpha games by indie developers.\n\nHere is a short list of bugs I’ve run into in just the first 2 hours:\nClicking a control point on a track randomly changes it rotation values, making it impossible to tweak the coaster without breaking everything.\nThere are memory leaks that cause the game to crash about once an hour.\nThere are occasional crashes during the loading screen.\nCars fall through the track on lift chain hills almost every other run.\nCars fall through the track of the station as soon as you hit test.\nFast forwarding time completely breaks the physics, causing even the slightest turn to throw trains off the rails.\nThe UI for lift chain speeds and booster/break speeds are the size of an ant. You can’t click it, much less read it.\nThe camera controls don’t work while editing coasters, and sometimes freeze up while editing paths, scenery, or terrain.\nThe rotation arrows for track editing are occasionally in the wrong direction.\nThe rotation values of track control points are almost always incorrect, also causes the white, yellow, and red highlighting to be incorrect. You can have a control point that looks like it should be 0 degree, and it will say it is 35 degree.\nIntersecting paths of different sizes don’t render properly.\nWooden coaster supports don’t render properly.\nEven with the max brush strength, it takes quite a while to fill a small pond with water. That was a horrible feature idea.\nI’ve already documented 137 more bugs, but I’m just going to leave the list there. Overall, the camera controls and editing controls are too buggy to use reliably, and the coaster editing features of this game are mostly broken.\n\nSince this was a beta to demonstrate just the coaster editor, and it is this bad, I don’t expect this game to be out this year unless they hire programmers just to fix bugs. I can’t even imagine how buggy all the other features are of the game. As it is, it looks like they have pushed the release date back again from Dec. 10th to Dec. 29th.","October 31, 2015","false","2.3"," 24 of 50 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","24","50","0","0"

First off, yes. I have not played Coaster Planet. Does Coaster Planet look nice? Yes. So does this, however. Are there things that I'd like to see improve? Well sure. That can be said about many games and this, fortunately, is still being worked on. For what I've got, I'm more than happy. Now that my little rant is over, allow me to explaid why I recomment this game:\n\nGameplay: Overall, the game plays more or less exactly like RollerCoaster Tycoon 3. The game does try to move away from the grid system, however there is an optional grid you can enable to make your work more precise. While the grid feature does require some touching up to allow for things to be more exact, it still works and helps. The Coaster Builder is also updated to bring a, in my opinion, more indepth and detailed construction process. You no longer are restricted to certain angles allowing you to have a lot more freedom in your design. It will also display data on how your speed is distributed on the track, how fast you are going at a given place, etc. I had a good amount of fun playing with it. Going back to paths, you can also make curved paths this time removing your restriction to blocky pathways. Overall the game plays the same, just with some slight tweeks and updates.\n\nGraphics: This seems to be another contested area. The game definitely went away from the cartoonish theme of old in favor of realism. This doesn't bother me too much (Yes, I've played every RCT game. Yes, I understand the style was cartoony in all of them. Sure, go ahead and call me a casual, not a fan, etcc.) The overall user interface looks clean, perhaps not "super uber professional" with its art direction like some may desire. However, it works, it looks good, and I like it. A lot of what you would expect out of a RCT interface is there.\n\nOverall: There really isn't a whole lot for me to pick on with this game. It is exactly what I'd expect from a RollerCoaster Tycoon game, there are definitely some improvements over RCT3, but there are defintely areas to improve on. I will still continue to play it and enjoy it and definitely looks forward to what will come in the game's future. If you are on the fence of buying this game, do understand this is a work in progress, and understand that it really is not half as bad as people seem to think it is. You will enjoy it nonetheless if you enjoyed past RCT games.","March 30","true","7.2"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

ANYWAYS. After having spent the last 6 and a half hours playing this game, I can without a doubt say that this game is living up to my expectations... Having been a fan since the original RCT and seeing it progress to RCT3, a trainwreck of a game, I had high hopes for this game since Atari had 12 years to think and improve. Atari has improved. The interface is insanely simple yet effective, also it has a very slick design to it, props to that. All the editors for scenery, rides, shops, etc... is easy to use and simple. What I love most is the coaster editor. The freeform builder has just enough complexity to it that you may create whatever you dream of, within physical boundaries of course, but it is simple enough and straight forward that basically any 14 year old can hop on here and start building coasters. I feel as though this is finally the game I've been waiting for. RCT3 had some good features to it, like the ride cam for instance, as well as the magnitude of scenery and ride options. When I play this game, I feel like I'm playing a near perfect combination of RCT1 and RCT3 and I am okay with that.","May 9","true","17.2"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","9","20","0","0"

I didnt expect it to be perfect as its still being developed but after around 10 hours of playing the game I pretty much enjoyed it!\n\nThe game basically takes me back to the original released in 1999 which was simple and focued on the rides and managment, this was the first I played and it was very entertaining. The customisation is also a work in progress as more themes have been confirmed by the developers as well as other stuff. The CoasterBuilder is also new and brilliant! It allows the franchise to evolve with players pulling and dragging the tracks making it more flexible. The second game in the series basically had lots of customisation and built on the first title however the newest game lacks themes and other objects but with more from the developers it soon might improve, the game also has user generated support so lots might be provided from the community of tycoon fans. The third game in the series bacially went 3d and wanted to expand everywhere which in my opinion didnt work and pushed many gamers back to the 2 originals, the UI and campaign were so bad I continued playing RCT2 as it seems the developers went crazy with zoos and water parks however with the newest game going back to its roots and starting again its seems the franchise can get back to its best! Many of the newest games features are very promising and deserve some time to be made perfect, Im willing to wait and share my experience with the developers to make the game decent and a standard which the originals set!\n\nYou've probably noticied that this review section is full of negetivie reviews, many just complain about the littlest bugs or problems that are not major and are expected as the game is in development! Im not suggesting they are not allowed a opinion but i thinks its alarming and unfair  that many of these players have only played the game for a short amount of time, I consider this not to be enough gametime time to judge a game such as RollerCoasterTycoon. Myself was actually confused getting to know the controls for the first hour however as I progressed it became more enjoyable, easy and relatable to the previous games in the series. The reason I'm writing this is because I would not want any possible players considering trying the game to be put off by a few comments that mostly include minimun issues, Its also  because most of these include the word "PlanetCoaster" Which is a similar game but shouldnt be advertised by their fanbase on this review section. Many will claim its a better game but thats your opinion however most of these people have not played RCTW long enought to make a review as many have played for a matter of minutes as I have seen. It also seems many have just followed the trail of popular youtubers, not fully given the game a chance and can not spot a valid problem with thr game that matters deeply in their reviews. These sort of reviews are not reviews so I reconmend you read wisely and check out some videos online to make your opinion.\n\nOverall the game is playable and enjoyable in Early Access, It has so much potentical that will hopefully be developed with the fans, its been truely resurrected from the ashes and seems to be going back to its roots similar to the original base game. E.T might have killed Atari along time ago but its certain now that Atari is back and evolving with RollerCoaster Tycoon World!","March 30","true","51.8"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

This one is a bit tricky at first. Expect to spend a few hours understanding how to make your first coaster unless you get some tips. This is more of a guide and review at the same time. Here are some tips. :)\n\nExpect a little frustration building your coaster at first. When building your coaster:  Hold down the shift key, and use the mouse wheel to move it higher or lower. After you click on a peice of the track in build mode you can drag out that track and make curves, etc. and press 1, 2, 3, or 4; all these numbers do different things. Then you use your mouse wheel and to adjust. One of the numbers lifts up the track on one side for example (press 2, and then use your mouse wheel for example).\n\nAlso the camera is a bit quirky. You can go into options in the game, general, turn off auto focus coaster when building (so it doesn't jump everytime you click on the track), turn off auto zoom out camera if object is to large, and change your camera field of view if you like.\n\nAlso the graphics can be improved; changing them is a bit quircky. This is done by pressing escape, options, graphics, turn off better fps over graphics.. This makes the graphics settings go lower for some reason though. You then need to adjust higher the other settings AFTER you select this.\n\nPlacing a ride or object: Hold down the shift key, and use your mouse wheel to turn it around before you place it.\n\nAdjusting the size of the map: Click modify terrain, and you'll find the option to expand there.\n\nAlso when you place a janitors building for example each building is used to hire the number of janitors for that building; differnent than RCT3.\n\nThis is a great game, but I think the issue is most people aren't taking the time to go through the tutorial. In addition to that the coaster building is a bit advanced; you can do a lot with it, but the key will be the first few hours.For beginners it's a bit tricky.\n\nIs it fun? Yes it's a lot of fun to play. I'm enjoying my park the more and mroe I play it. The more I play, the more I want to play. It starts out slow and grows on you once you figure out what your doing. It's also fun to decorate/improve the park.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice as well. I'm looing forward to this game growing, but as for now it's a good game if your willing to read a guide like this one and others you'll be fine. :) Also if you enjoy a challenge on coaster building you'll like this game. Expect a lot of crashes during testing, but it's gratifying and realistic.. You adjust angles of track to compensate, etc. It just feels nice, and it's a good sandbox style game.\n\nThere are a good amount of rides, and park finances.\n\nWhy are there bad reviews section: Most people don't understand the options they have at their disposal, and haven't read the tips/guides on controls. Changing the graphic options, and adjusting the camera are all fairly easy to do once you have read these trips.\n\nI have experienced some crashes for example when making a huge roller coaster with lots of turns, etc. I'd say save every so often in case, but the coaster build is pretty fun once you get the hang of it. The game is itself seems to run pretty smooth though on my system; a 980 GTX, 16 gigs ram, and a 3.4 ghz quad.\n\nThe problem is if people didn't get it within 1-2 hours many immediately went for the bad review/refund option, but this one is worth digging deeper and playing imo. :)","April 1","true","29.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

It should be called a Beta really . This might define it better for people thinking this is an oppurtunity to play a finished game before its released to everyone. If u hate buggy games that arent ready, the Beta and Early access games arent for u! It has the makings of a half-decent game, bugs are expected. I have personally played a lot of Betas, test environments and Early Access games. So i expect bugs and report them. Find me one game without bugs, but its already released? lol\n\nThe game has the makings of a good new RCT, only updated to 2016. It should become better than RCT3 if it keeps on track and fixes the problems. I could point out lots of the "bugs" but that would only put u off, the same as the other negative reviews, Again judging a game on its current state, instead of how great it could be on release. Its not all about better graphics and animations. It is well on track to have better interaction between player and the NPCs (seeing what they need, what they have spent, what they think of your park, etc). It has more shops, rides and a rollercoaster builder (for you to create your own great ride) and custom content, that will be shared on the Steam Workshop between players.\n\nIf you are worried about its current state, hold off buying, dont read more into the negative youtube videos and reviews, etc. Remember, its about the finished release version 1.0 that you should be concerned with. THEN read the real reviews and pass judgement on the game and then decide to buy or not!","April 25","true","3.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

This game has been a long time in development, changing hands and I think the vision of the game has changed along the way. The game worked, it was playable, there were minor glitches, but the game did run. I found it intuitive to play, and somewhat familiar and the rides were fun and detailed. I eventually decided that this game was not for me, at least in its current state and I did feel that some parts were missing here and there.","May 5","true","1.9"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","6","14","0","0"

Other than that I enjoy customizing the cars for the coasters or the colors of the paths or que lines. I enjoy the fact that the peeps have a mind of their own. Some dont like to ride certain rides, some only like roller coasters.\n\nThe Coaster Builder. - Took me alot of time to get used to, forgetting to use shift to make it rise, or tilt. I enjoy the fact that some coasters can spin, reminded me of *Thrillville off the rails*.\n\nI enjoy the fact that the mascots seem to make everyone happy. I also enjoy that there are SO MANY differnt food buildings, theres like 4 different buildings just for tacos and salads!!!\n\nOne thing that I really really enjoy is that I can ramp the paths, like, I made a little river, so I boosted the path up to go over the river, and I put a wooden rollercoaster track under and over it, so My peeps can enjoy a good coaster on the entrance of the park.\n\nThe performance isnt 10/10, nor is the FPS, but it is playable....\n\nIm surprised my FPS lasted pretty good with the ammount of items and peeps in the park, there were around 1,800 peeps in the park and over hundreds of differnt pieces. 6 Roller coasters spread out all over. 60+ food buildings, 8 mechanic buildings with 10 mechanics for each building. 5 entertainer buildings, once again 10 entertainers for each building. 9 Janitor buildings, 10 janitors for each building. atleast 80 plants and trees, a lake, and over 10 thrill / family / and Junior rides.....\n\nPeeps arent to bad, yeah they walk through each other, but eventually theres so many peeps in your park you dont even notice it.

The new stalls rides and park accessories are really nice. The one thing I do not like is how the paths do not connect like the last four games have this makes it more difficult to enjoy since it has to be a degree on or off to work, the delete button and rotate is not the same which makes the game slow down just in doing the shift to rotate. The game takes a while to get used to from the last one.

There are no more sharp camera jitters on curves, and the new "Typhoon" ride is great and so far my favorite flat in the release. The fixes shown in this first update indicate that this game should be going down a more positive track. UGC for this game is also already jumping up, which is always good. Although there is still a lack of official content, and there is still no mass bulldoze tool I am hoping we will see vast improvements soon, and that this update was just the start.\nI will update my review as updates for the game are launchedOn a serious note this game needs major work before a full release. It runs at a constant 60 FPS on my R9 280x, but not on any on nVidia cards (770, 960, Quadro). That in itself if a game breaker for many people. The graphics are BAD for a 2016 game though, and should run at 60 on anything. I really hope that graphics are dumbed down for this build, shadows and day phases are choppy, distant objects are humonguos pixels, and objects such as coaster cars even need higher textures. The physics are also not where they should be for a RCT game, I had a coaster stall out past a holding brake on an 80 degree drop, which is confusing, and if you make a level track oval around the station and test the coaster it can make it all the way around the station, which is not the case in real life. On the plus side Unity objects can be imported in seconds, but unity is hurting more than helping, its trash for physics, and also not great helping make a fabulous looking game. No AAA title ever uses unity, it was a grave mistake. Other things that are annoying is trees have priority over everything, and you need to demolish the trees one by one to place a coaster or anything else for that matter. Curves also are not smooth on the camera and it needs to be worked on. Overall the game is okay at its current state, at about the same stage as Planet Coasters early alpha. If you were to buy it today 20 dollars would be the price I would pay, past that I would consider waiting and seeing how it shapes up.\n\nIn its current state I would say 5/10, but I would reccomend for anyone who enjoys theme parks simulators, coming from someone who played thousands of hours in RCT1, 2, and 3 I will say that at the moment it is by far the worst in the series (Except 4, the mobile game) but I beleive that the game will be worked on to the point where it is competitive.\nI will update my review as updates for the game are launched","April 2","true","59.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","0"

And that I haven't read what they're up to putting into it yet.\n\nPro's:\n- I love the rides.\n- I love the fact that now there's actually ''death'' possible when you build a rollercoaster, which makes it more challenging to build one.\n- You can now move stuff without deleting it first compared to the other RC games.\n- The campagne is fun, however, I think it'd be more fun if added more challenges to it.\n\nCon's:\n- Even on my brother's game computer it lags. I have one myself, whilst my brothers literally meets all the requirements. It is not recommended for laptops or so unless you got yourself a strong, good laptop(mainly due overheating).\n- The paths are annoying to place. I tried putting a path from a building to the ''main street'' but it replaced the old path from the ''mainstreet''.\n- The buildings look all the same, at least for the staff.\n- I hate the staff buildings. They barely do anything and in RTC3 I really enjoyed the fact you could throw staff in your park and train them etc.\n_\nI've heard a lot of negative things about RCTW , but keep in mind it's still Early Access. From what I saw, they've improved quite a few things. I see a lot of people saying although Planet Coaster isn't done yet but better. I didn't play PC, and I don't care.\n\nBoth of them still need to be finished and I'm sure this game gets better as time goes on.","April 29","true","7.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

When it was released there's no doubt it left a lot be desired as there were numerous bugs but having bought the game and played it myself now it is developing into an excellent theme park building game. What is going to go massively in this game's favour is the ease of importing models into this game. Quite frankly the possibilities are endless. The amount of UGC is already quite high and will keep going but it would be nice to see some other tools such as a full map creator. I know you can create scenarios by using terraforming tools in sandbox but nevertheless would be nice to see a map builder. This game still needs some optimizing as well as it can run quite jerkily when on high graphics but seems perfectly smooth on medium graphics. This may also be partly down to my PC although it is quite new. It took a couple of updates to get there but good job Atari and keep the updates and content coming.","May 25","true","4.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

New screenshots etc have been released - but no dates on either Beta 2 or Release date... Im getting bored and tired.\n\nThis game got be so awesome when its out. If its ever coming out...\nMy hopes; Will be out before Planet Coaster, which is set to be released Q4 2016\n\nIll go back to bed, cya.\n\n-----\n\nEdit: 11. january:\nSo, we havnt heard a word since early december. Was promised two beta weekends, got one - and the other one got delayed - but as said: We havnt heard a WORD since the "happy holiday" where absolutly nothing was said.\n\nHmmmmm...\n\n-----\n\nSo I spend 2 hours playing the game tonight and here is my thoughts:\n\nI started with the plants, benches all that jazz. Built a nice path to start with, and start placing objects. The first thing that got on my nerves was, even though you promised a non-grid game, everything snaps to everything. The radius of snapping to path is HUGE. You cant even place fences along a curved path.\n\nRight, so we had to test the coaster physics. So after I played around with the tools to build it, I restarted and got seriously. I tried guys, I really tried! I got 1 coaster to work(!). That working coaster had one drop and then it ended. I tested it 4 times and 3 times it crashed while being dragged to the first drop.. I mean... It was a straight rail, and it just fell off.\n\nNow, the controls and the way the coaster builder works is just hard to figure out... What does the colors (black, white, red, yellow) means? It doesn't mean that, when its red, it cant go that way.. Because it can... sometimes.\n\nThat being said - its a beautiful game with a lot of potential but I have to say this.. You won't make it to the release date, unless you're having a WAY different version than us. I really don't get how a bunch of developers can sit at a table and agree on: Guys! We release this beta so people can see how awesome it is..!\n\nI'm sorry for the negative thoughts - but this was really 2 hours of total frustration. Ill look into this, when we hit release, but for now- its not going to happen.\n\nI wish you the BEST of luck - and I hope this game will come out and BLOW us away... I love the franchise, please make it happen. Thank you.","October 30, 2015","false","18.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Maybe im missing a couple features, but I cant be sure. I didn't play rct3 because It was kind of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nJust a note: One of the rides is broken, the one that is supposed to swing the guests with the whole seating mechanism spinning (I cant remember the name). It sits at the top and does not release and just spins at the top of its rotation.\n\nReccomended hardware: Any mouse with an infinite scroll wheel\n\nThe one thing I love more than anything is the roller coaster design and the application of mechanics within them (though making loops and ♥♥♥♥ is hard).  The path building is also cool, but I never use the curved pathways because they never seem to work or let any other paths snap. You should also allow for automatic scenery destruction when creating the coasters, placing pre-mades or at least expand the destruction to only destroy scenery in xy range.\nThings I hate are the laggy experiances you get which you can only assume is due to a memory leak or soemthing else.\n\nThe buildings are cool, though I hate the fact that you need to place a path for each and every one is really annoying. This is one of those features im going to test later with the grid snap and see if that helps out at all. The default station platforms are limiting, but the use of the brakes is a more realistic (and maybe better?).\n\nI hate hate hate the use of the word "peeps" and how the "peeps" thoughts don't stack. This is something that is absolutely needed. Also the use of the words People or Guests looks better.\n\nIs this game worth $60 right now?

I was worried about the whole 'early access' and if this was even goingt o run properly on my older comptuters. I took the Planet Coaster comments seriously and did look into their product (I'm not sure how it is a 'game' yet... seems more like 'build only' platform which does not interest me) - I'll keep it on my Radar. ANYWAYS - the reason I am writing my review, was I almost did not buy RCTW because of all the mud being flung in this fued. It took several youtube video's to convince me that the product was ready... so here is is..\n\nTHIS PRODUCT IS WORTH IT - PARTICULARLY IF YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ORIGINALS.\n\nThere is enough working so it feels like a finished product. There are scenarious, multiple (10?+) coaster types, 100's? of rides, etc. The scenery selection is decent, however it is a little light on the themes.\n\nThe new coaster creator - You can either create a coaster the 'old' way (piece by piece w/ a button editor) or with their new spline based system. I work in 3D all day long, but first started with the 'old' way for comfort sake. In my second park, I only built w/ the new system.\n\nThere are SOME glittches. Paths sometimes don't want to snap together right, but they will 99% of the time, they just might not be 'pretty'. - they will NOT impeed the play of the game. General sim animation glitches, but again, this doesn't seem to impeed the play of the game.  Food/Drink stands don't snap to the edge of paths, so you need to place them and make a very short path to the path etc. etc. NONE OF THESE ELEMENTS STOP YOU FROM PLAYING!\n\nAlso, I'm fairly happy to report that so far they do seem to be improving the game w/ updates.\n\nANYWAYS - is you are a fan, and you're getting cold feet based on the reviews from the haters... hopefully this review will help you make a decision to buy. The only type of person I'd not recomend this to is someone w/ OCD that needs their parks to look perfectly symetrically and pretty. That's not going to happen yet. Play for the game itself, or play in sandbox mode to make really really awesome roller coasters. (which by the way you need a hack to use in planet coaster? WTF?)\n\nThe only thing I may add, is if you're going to have to starve yourself for a week to save up th $50, eat... or maybe eat PB&J and buy RCT3 (assuming it will still run on Windows 10) for the 20 or whatever to get your fix and see where this price will end up - but $50 for a game like this, is not a bad investment.\n\n","April 10","true","15.8"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","6","15","0","0"

First of all I have been a player of this series since RCT1 was out, I've had most of my hours in this series played in RCT2 but I've still played countless hours of RCT3. This new game has put a very sour taste in my mouth and it seem to have done the same for many other fans of the series. but looking at tis game as it is, it isn't awful. The textures and movement of the peeps are my biggest complaint and the pathing isn't very smooth and needs to be fixed. but other than that, this game has a monetary system and scenario and well made terrain deformation and water(even though the water doesn't look very good), It also doesn't run great but the just means it needs to be a little better optimized which is usually the last thing a developer does in a game. This game definetely has some things it needs to fix, but if they can tweak those few things, it'll be a pretty good coaster tycoon game.\n\nTL;DR\nThe game has graphic issues and looks a little weird, but it has potential to be a good game","March 31","true","4.9"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

Y'know, the days of Chris Sawyer? (pre-lawsuit, of course)\n\nKeeping in mind that this game is early access with said early access having been pushed back for months and months by the publisher due to quality control... well, the quality here is, at best, mediocre; probably not worth the wait.\nPersonally, I really dig the game. It's keeps me amused while I have free time before or after work, but I'm unsure if it has that same vibe as any of the previous RTC games as of yet.\nThe graphics are "prettier" than its predecessors, but not optimized in the slightest. At this time, it's remarkably limited (due to early access). Given just how much the early access was pushed back, I did expect a little more refining on what the devs said they had been working on. It feels as if they left some things unchecked on their to-do list.\n\nIn it's current state, it doesn't even remotely stand up to what RTC3 was, or even the original game (yes, even without expansions, this game could not stand up to it). The graphics and animations are janky, completely incomplete in comparison, though I highly respect the attempts at a more realistic look. Glitches are, obviously, numerous. The controls are offputting to me, but that could just be because it's a new game. My computer, which though isn't amazing, should be able to play it no problem; the optimization on this is currently horrid to flat-out nonexistent (keeping in mind that this is early access and many tools, bits, and bobs can't be fully optimized without tests; it doesn't make it any less annoying to a player [even in early access]). The game will freeze while trying to load a scenario and most campaign maps. For me, it can only load up sandbox mode and the first campaign map without trouble.\nDue to it's early access state, there isn't much of a campaign mode nor scenarios. If you can't get them to load like me, there's even less of a selection.\nThe delete tool is sort of atrocious; since you have to play on low quality, you have to zoom in to kill some azaleas (sorry, flowers) before you can even build a ride. Yes, you can apparently build through trees no problem, but save the flowers! You can't build over paths if you decide that you like one more. You have to individually delete each path section and then rebuild your chosen path. Individually. Delete. Path sections. Or individually delete trees. Individually. I was hoping for a click'n'drag, delete all the things, KILL IT ALL mentality as it would make clearing an area less annoying. The path issue was fixed in RCT3 with that path tool, but even then you could only individually delete plants and rocks (or have I missed something?)\nPath building itself can be a bear. Sometimes it says you can't connect paths, but I rarely ever see the reason why. Unfortunately, with each path being a "bone", you can't always add another bone to it. Even though you may just be making the spine longer.\nWhile I really dig the coaster builder (I think this will always be considered the "best" part of the game, even in a completed state), it is incredibly awkward to use. There's multiple tabs, which I don't mind, but they make it seem clunky. (Though having it all together would probably be even worse). I feel like the coaster builder from RCT3 was far more refined and usable. It didn't give me a headache. But I also couldn't have made the amazing tracks I can now.\nFor paths and coaster tracks, you can move the mouse wheel to rise or lower the pieces. Unless there's some sensitivity thing I'm missing, this is very slow.\nYou now have staff buildings rather than just hiring staff. And, as of right now, you can't change their outfits. Not even for the entertainers. So in my normal park, instead of having a black'n'white panda like I would in RCT, I get blue and white (which is the "normal" panda for RCT) and. Wait for it. Aliens and owls(I think. Wtf is that thing?). I don't even know what else. I liked having my natural pandas, black leopards, cheetahs, and lions in RCT3. Minor complaint, and probably something that will be implemented later so we don't have owl things walking around in a space themed park.\nFortunately, it is early access. Most of this should (hopefully) be fixed in the future.\n\nDespite all it's negatives, I currently really do enjoy the game, apparently having been playing RCT games for over fifteen years. I still play RTC1-3. But unfortunately, like I said, it doesn't stand up to these.\nBut, for what this game is, it is enjoyable as a long-time fan. I don't see myself playing a ton of it as of yet given the number of issues and the fact that the older games simply are better right now. I'm just hopeful that there's no more push backs and that the devs stay on it.\n\nWhile I do recommend, I honestly suggest holding onto your money for just a bit (maybe another update or two) unless you remember the days of old and bare-bones 1990's games and don't mind that sort of thing. At this state, it is not worth the money, confusion, or irritation for most people. That being said, I personally do plan on playing the game every now and again while complaining about the weird controls all the way.\nHowever, I hope the devs know that I was willing to spend my money in the name of RCT and publisher (Atari) in hopes of a good future game.","April 1","true","14.8"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

The Artwork resembles any bland MAC application with some grey boring icons and grey paths, grey coasters, low colour vibrancy where there is colour. It's like they looked at RCT2 and thought 'No, we dont like colours. We like grey and black and white. Borders? No, we don't like borders, we like MINIMAL feel'. End result: the game has no soul, no feeling of Theme Parks, you are like an engineer or town planner, NOT MR Eccentric Tycoon with a funny moustache and wacky clothing! And the game is called TYCOON, you would think the devs would know this, but apparently smart people can be stupid!!!!!\n\n2. The coaster building is slow and fiddly. There's a number of reasons for this, but it's never going to be fixed as there's no QUICK way to build coasters like in RCT2. You have to do tests and after waiting 3-4 mins for the carriages to get to the corner in question, only then do you find out if it works or not. Then you spend the next 5-10 mins trying to minimise the g-force (which is the usual issue), but you have no idea if you have done enough until you do a test! This feels like a 'Pro Mode', or Kerbal Space Program, with realistic physics, and no way for you to easily tell if your track is ok.

The games and their developers have nothing to do with each other, but D3 received such a poor reception after it came out, and probably deserved it, but Blizzard fixed its problems. D3 is fantastic now.\n\nThis game is early access, and people argue that it is NOT complete enough to even -be- in early access, but honestly I'd compare this to Ark's early stages. The game is bug-ridden, poorly optimized for performance, has unbalanced systems and an average amount of content. It's being actively developed though: they release patches regularly for issues and consistently add new stuff. They don't address all the bugs each patch, but it's a process.\n\nRCTW definitely has a chance. I'm willing to give it a 'Yes' now and see what fixes come out. I do believe that they can still change stuff like path building being wonky, having to remove every single little piece of foliage one by one to place stuff, and even some of the performance issues once they get proper feedback.\n\nTL;DR People are mercilessly slaughtering this game without giving it a chance, but I think it's worthwhile to keep an eye on.","April 4","true","5.4"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","1"

In my opionion i feel like the developers should add a feature where when your building a rollercoaster you can have a option to see if the coaster will have enough speed to make it over a abstical your building. I would find myself having to wait after i select the test coaster button, i would wait for the coaster to finally get to the part where i would be tweaking or fixing to see weather it would fail or pass.

Being that it's still in Early Access, I'm a bit more forgiving. However, by the time the proper release rolls around, if the current issues are still withstanding, then I'd have no qualms about updating my review and recommendation.\n\nAll in all, do your research about RCTW. Yes, Planet Coaster is all around a better theme park sim as it stands, but it's double the price to buy in to Planet Coaster's alpha. If you're on a budget, and want a new park sim, and can deal with it's quirks, I don't see why anyone shouldn't give RCTW a try.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/phensh23/recommended/282560/","phensh23","Canuck.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/phensh23/","74 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPROS\n- Coaster Builder: It's always been so easy to create a roller coaster in RCT, and this coaster builder definitely adds a challenge and makes me want to get better at making them. It can get very complicated though, particularly when the supports of (most noticeably) the wooden coaster get in the way and you actually can no longer see what piece you're making. I also found that when you ride the coaster in first person  there's alot of little bumps and mini-twists in the track that I hadn't noticed before, making the roller coaster seem really unnatural.. this may, however, be down to my inexperience with the feature.\n\n- Variety: Not too bad, only about 8 types of roller coaster, such as Stand-up, Hyper, Wooden, Flying etc. I'm sure this list will grow however. Also a few flat rides which, again, will grow in time, but for now it's enough considering it's EA.\n\n- Realism: Everything ACTUALLY looks right and feels real, everything is bigger, MUCH bigger, with realistic, big roller coaster stations, buildings take up way more than one square on the grid.. everything is just BIGGER. The parking lot out the front, the entrance itself.. the scale is just massive and really feels like a real theme park.\n\nMusic: Seemingly unimportant but I like it.\n\nCONS\n- Not as developed as I was hoping for: I honestly thought the game was WAY more developed than this.. it still feels like a skeleton. Know that I didn't play the beta though, this is a brand new experience of RCTW for me, so I can't compare it to that. I've been following the game since it's announcements but have nothing more to go on than screenshots and trailers. I was a bit gutted when I discovered the game was coming to EA.. Atari really do have no excuse for being this slow, I think they announced the game way too early that now it's annoyed people so much a lot of us WANT it to fail. I'm not one of these people, but I sense from other people's comments that they just want to see this game drow after putting so much hope (and a bit of money, too) into it! So yeah, this far down the line I expected much more meat on the bones.. but alas, it still feels very empty. (This may contradict my PRO for variety, but in that sense I understand the game is EA and will have little variety, despite the fact I wished it was further into development than this)\n\n- Paths: oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Words cannot describe.. They're the most infuriating thing and I can't explain why.. They've been very lazy with the paths, they don't build right, they mess up all the time.. oh my god, just paths. Sort it, please.. There was nothing wrong with simple click and place in the previous games or, heck, ANY other simulator! The grid also needs revising, I think, nothing seems to fit nicely.\n\n- Visuals, ie menus and HUD: Wooowwww it's hideious. Like, actually hideous.. I don't know if they're going for a Sims 4 kind of minimalistic display in-game, which would look good.. but it just looks so random, maybe like they haven't really focused on that yet. The menus look cheap and Alpha-like.. think Cities:Skylines, just a grey, rounded text box with some words in. Put some effort in, Nvizzio! Get some sort of theme going with the menus, like the blue bubbles in RCT3! It just makes it look.. like a game!?\n\n- Buggy: Yes yes yes, it's EA I knoooww, but considering (again) how long this has supposedly been in development (I get the feeling they just go into the office every Sunday or something to do 2-3 hours worth of actual development on the game) it's a bit odd to se a mechanic floating around and attempt to inspect a ride whilst it's mid-flow, getting kicked in the face multiple times by the flying chairs.. silly. The game just crashed on me for no reason either, to be expected in EA I know, but this far down the line? Not sure.\n\nVERDICT\nI want to give this games a thumbs up, just to show them that there IS somebody still rooting for this game. My biggest worry is that all these (overwhelming amount!) negative reviews will make them think "Ah screw it, we're giving up. Nobody cares anymore, we're only going to be slated for everything.." and BOOM, there goes RCTW. I know this won't happen, I trust the developers are passionate about this game and want to make it better.. just please do it, listen to the fans and start righting your wrongs. We WANT to like this game, I want to LOVE this game.. and I will still hold on to the hope that one day, maybe soon, I will. RollerCoaster Tycoon World could be amazing.. just look back at what made the first three games so good, and do it better. I have faith in this game, and when it's at a stage that I can reccomend it to other people.. I most certainly will :)","March 31","true","8.8"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It does take some time to adjust if you're used to the older games' way of building. From what I've experienced so far it's been great, but that's not to say there aren't any problems with it.\n\nThe biggest problem I've encountered so far are the restraints. For example, wooden coasters can barely be tilted whereas in real life there are some that do corkscrews just fine. Similar constraints apply to the paths placement as well; I couldn't make a path up to my ride because the game (as it stands during Beta Weekend 1) doesn't have stairs and as a result, you have to elevate your paths over a long distance. Even then I could only build a queue to the ride entrance and not the exit, for what reason I have no idea.\n\nThe physics seems to be a bit iffy as well. I made a drop coaster that curved upwards into a loop, but as soon as the coaster hit around 60mph it just fell off the track, regardless of how insignificant the curve was.\n\nThe decorations are good, although it would be nice to have local build limitations (such as hitboxes on other objects) displayed. I tried to wall off one of the gold statues but I had a pretty difficult time with it because of the hitbox being larger than what the model actually shows when you hold it.\n\nThe game itself was also having a few issues. When I tabbed out and back in sometimes my camera would be locked and the UI buttons wouldn't do anything forcing me to restart from my last save point. The ability to view your coasters in first person is also seemingly random; you have to test it and hope the coaster editor bar doesn't show up at the bottom so you can click the coaster again to get to the camera button.\n\nOverall, it's a relatively enjoyable experience. If you do encounter any issues I would highly recommend providing feedback on the RollerCoaster Tycoon World forums. It's important to bear in mind that this is a limited development build and some of the issues we're having may already be addressed. Is it worth £29.99? As of beta weekend 1, no. I'd wait for release reviews if you're not interested in bugs.\n\nAny further review past Beta Weekend 1 will be added below this. I'll keep editing the original during the weekend the more I play.","October 30, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

She's not the biggest gamer, actually, not a gamer at all so if this game can capture her attentionand I know she looks forward tothe next time she has freetime to play then to me it was worth my purchase. I have watched her play and I myself think that while there is still plenty of room to improve, it does look nice and for the most part operates fairly smoothly.\n\nThe ability to place buildings facing nearly any direction is a nice feature because in previous installments choosing one of four directions became relentlessly boring.\n\nThat being said, it would be nice to have better graphics options. I realize this game is more for a common crowd with average machines than it is for the game enthusiasts but it would be great for the game to make use of the available resources on upscale machines.\n\nSo, keep in mind, while this has been a long awaited installment in the franchise, this is still early access and there are going to be glitches and room for improvement.

I think the developers have got the right idea and have done a good job with what they have done so far. Yes its got some issues with gitches and sound and sometimes my people just suddenly freeze but this is early access. I like how much easier it is to build rollercoasters and i like all the personal touches that you can do with them, at the same time im glad theyve kept the pre-made rollercoasters. I also think the detail thats gone into the stations is really good. I was a little unsure about space but after 2 hours of playing i found that this was just me not knowing how to play the game yet, because you can buy more land by going on the terrain tool button, and i found if i pressed the letter n ( i play on my laptop) it allows you to place buildings closer to rides etc. I like what theyve done with the themes, and have been able to make a western and an adventure area with what is available in this early access game. I am looking forward to see what the updates will bring. The only negatives ive found so far is deleting items such as bins, lamposts etc im finding you have to put your mouse in a certain spot for it to highlight. Deleting the trees and bushes one at a time is also a little tedious as i cant find an option to delete a large area at a time, id like atari to look into putting a multi- tool delete option or something similiar to fix this. Ive also found that i cant place rides or anything if theres trees etc in the way without deleting them all yourself and then finding the ride you wanted again so i would also like the rides etc to automatically delete the trees etc for you.  nearly forgot but Im not liking the staff limit, im ending up with lots of staff buildings which only allow 3 staff and the cleaners dont seem to do anything because after placing 5 cleaner buildings my parks still a mess, I see them cleaning but it doesnt seem to make any difference, same for mechanics too. I know there will be larger building available but i can imagine me just having lots of larger staff buildings everywhere. Other than that im happy with what ive seen so far.\n\nSince playing further ive had issues reloading a saved game it just crashes saying virtual memory to low to play game, but my virtual memory is fine.

It is a beta but when people expect like the full out game content, you won't get it. The game is good so far. I am still waiting to see if they will put more contents in the game. The rollercoaster builder is much more realistic and easier at some aspects but making loops are somewhat very hard. I recommend Atari or whoever is working on the game to put the old style way of building rollercoasters as well as the new one. Other than that, I can't wait to see the full game. Still needs a lot of work but for a beta, it's ok.","October 30, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GNTH/recommended/282560/","GNTH","Liberty Prime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GNTH/","311 products in account","(Written during Beta Weekend 1)\n\nI can understand where people are coming from with the new coaster builder. It does take some time to adjust if you're used to the older games' way of building. From what I've experienced so far it's been great, but that's not to say there aren't any problems with it.\n\nThe biggest problem I've encountered so far are the restraints. For example, wooden coasters can barely be tilted whereas in real life there are some that do corkscrews just fine. Similar constraints apply to the paths placement as well; I couldn't make a path up to my ride because the game (as it stands during Beta Weekend 1) doesn't have stairs and as a result, you have to elevate your paths over a long distance. Even then I could only build a queue to the ride entrance and not the exit, for what reason I have no idea.\n\nThe physics seems to be a bit iffy as well. I made a drop coaster that curved upwards into a loop, but as soon as the coaster hit around 60mph it just fell off the track, regardless of how insignificant the curve was.\n\nThe decorations are good, although it would be nice to have local build limitations (such as hitboxes on other objects) displayed. I tried to wall off one of the gold statues but I had a pretty difficult time with it because of the hitbox being larger than what the model actually shows when you hold it.\n\nThe game itself was also having a few issues. When I tabbed out and back in sometimes my camera would be locked and the UI buttons wouldn't do anything forcing me to restart from my last save point. The ability to view your coasters in first person is also seemingly random; you have to test it and hope the coaster editor bar doesn't show up at the bottom so you can click the coaster again to get to the camera button.\n\nOverall, it's a relatively enjoyable experience. If you do encounter any issues I would highly recommend providing feedback on the RollerCoaster Tycoon World forums. It's important to bear in mind that this is a limited development build and some of the issues we're having may already be addressed. Is it worth £29.99? As of beta weekend 1, no. I'd wait for release reviews if you're not interested in bugs.\n\nAny further review past Beta Weekend 1 will be added below this. I'll keep editing the original during the weekend the more I play.","October 30, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Yes there is things that work really well and things that don't. it's all part of the development process and I'm sure the devs will get onto improving these features over the next couple of weeks and months leading up to the V1 release.\n\nThe gameplay for me so far has been relatively solid and no major problems that disrupt the game completely if anything it's mainly just minor superficial things so I'm going to list them out below.\n\n#1 Pavements: These are the most frustrating parts of the game to build as far as I'm concerned and as a person who likes to keep things looking smart and symetrical this has been a hinderance does present a problem placing buidlings next to each other. my recommendation to the developers, allow pavements to connect to each other at any point instead of somewhere randomly in the middle.\n\n#2 Bulldozer tool: I had to remove some trees and shrubbery in some areas to make space for rides, buildings etc. The bulldozer only lets you remove one object at a time with can be tedious when there is smaller things hidden behind trees. If there is possiblity for a bulldozer brush tool to remove large areas of clutter quickly that would be appreciated.\n\nOverall: I think RCTW is quite a good solid build for an early access and it has potential to to get even better, I implore anyone that is thinking about buying this game that you should consider the early access tag and please make notes of any bugs/defects or anything you think would improve the game and let the developers know so it can flourish as a sequel of the much loved series.\n\n","March 30","true","9.3"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Every aspect of the game needs work. However, that being said, there are some very promissing aspects of this game. For example, the coaster building mechanics are top-notch. It combines the ease of piece-by-piece with the fine detained spline based editing to easily create specific track. However, you cannot "delete" a part of the track, only mess around with the nodes, which makes sense. Also, because it's so "realistic," you have to create realistic tracks, or it's not going to work. In the previous RTC games, you could slap together parts all willy-nilly and as long as it was a completed circut and didn't stall anywhere, it was "rideable." Not the case in this game, but I think it really makes you consider aspects you normally would not, so at the end of the day, you're more proud of what you've done. So good coaster building mechanics, but implementation still needs work.\n\nAnother example is the staff, I don't have much to say other than I'm not a fan of the "huts-that-take-up-space-and-provide-little-help-and-organization" way of doing it. I think parkitect has an amazing system where you just had break rooms placed about that increaded productivity.\n\nThe path placing and using is really the worst part. It's the only thing I absolutly hate about this game. It's extremely tempermental and I am always fighting it, sometimes to the point of tears. It's very annoying. (Pro tip: the large paths are the worst offenders, so just don't.) Also, because of the sudo-grid system, it's much more time consuming to place benches, trash cans, and lights. In RCT 1,2, and 3, I just went "lamp, bench, trash, repeat." With one per square, it was quick and painless and provided a system that met and exceded the requirements for the needs. Now, you have to pay super attention to place it exactly, and because paths don't like being even and symmetrical, it never looks good. And that's if it lets you place it! Yeah, it's really only a problem if you have OCD, but lets be real, that was one of the good things about RCT 2. I would like to see a mod or something that uses a more rigid grid. Also, while I'm on the topic of OCD, the grid that follows your mouse around (really nice, actually) has different weighted lines to mark large squares, which is normal. Well, the center line of the park DOES NOT MATCH UP WITH THE CENTER OF THE ENTRANCE!!! HOW?! WHY?! WHO?! And you can't extend the first bit of path and keep it striaght! IT BOTHERS ME SO MUCH!\n\nAnyway, I can go on, but I think I'll leave it at this: It's very promising, and I'm really excited for a polished version. I'm going to recommend this game not because of it's current state, but because of it's potential. All of the bad reviews bring up fixable problems, and over time I'm sure they will get fixed and the final result will be a great game.","March 30","true","9.3"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The interface for building a coaster is extremely confusing and not straightforward in the slightest. There's no simple way to build a loop, delete a piece of track, or edit a piece that you've already created. It's almost impossible to build a coaster in a straight line, even with the grid tool. I was only able to 'ride' my coasters once and there was a weird box around the train that interfered with the line of sight. On top of that, the game is just buggy and runs really slow.

I can imagine if someone in the community mods decent peeps this could actually turn out to be a hit… (with the right pricing)","March 30","true","15.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

There are still many bugs to be worked out.  My hopes are the developers will address issues reported by players and longtime fans.  I don't have a huge complaint on graphics as I expected the cartoonish style of art.  However, the details and movement of the people are bleak.\n\nSome things to think about:\nPoor optimization.\nRoad system isn’t always ideal.  IE: Doesn’t align or connect to grid.\n"Snapping" isn’t very intuitive and poorly aligns.\nPeople are poorly animated.\nNot a lot of content but there is a built in social share system, although it was empty for me.\nLack of in depth management tools (staff management, etc.)\nPoor optimization. (Yes, I said it twice)\nDeleting can be a pain.  Would be nice to see a drag and delete feature.\n\nThe concern is that it was previously said to be near finished.  I truly hope that was said in error and that development is still moving forward and we can expect to see updates and patches.\n\nUnlike some others I find the Rc builder to be quite nice and challenging for a game that offers little challenge at first to even a novice as plopping down a few ready-made rides will easily get you by money wise.\n\n4-5 out of 10 for me.

It is flopping heavily with its loyal forgiving fans, and PCGamer and Atari themselves hyping this game up before it even came out seemed suspicious enough for be, but I bought it anyways.  Even with my middle-high tier PC, I feel like I was loading it on XP, ARK performed better than this.\n\nI'm not going to complain about the coaster editor, I love the spline editor, and it was going really good.\n\nWhat I will complain about is the crashing is way too sensitive.  Call it difficult if you want, but it's hard to get fast speeds and keep your coaster on the track when the hill collisions don't even work and it flies off the coaster before it even gets to the hill.\nYour cursor and the spline editor will also magically de-sync, making the game unplayable, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out how to delete parts without having to delete the whole coaster.\n\nThe music is horrid and if it reminded me of anything, it reminded me of how bad the Sim City reboot was.  That's what this game is.\n\nThe beta doesn't even work in windowed mode!  You can't even change the resolution!  It's horrible!  The options menu is literally just the terms of service!!  And considering this is the most resource heavy game I've ever played on my computer, video settings are what you absolutely need the most!\n\nMaybe it will become better in the future.

This is a review from the october beta.\n\nIssues:\n-No sound or graphics options, which should be in any build of the game.\n-If your coaster doesn't work, may as well just delete it.\n-When you delete a part of the path it auto fills in between the two places, making it imposible to make mid coaster edits.\n-The coasters fly off the curve way to easily, and there is no way to adjust the bank of a curve after you've moved past that part\n-The physics need some work. There is no sense of gravity on the cars when they fly off\n-There is no way to pan the camera on the mouse\n-There is no real way to control the angle of the drop\n-There is no real way to control the angle of the turn\n-The graphics are in desparate need of AA.\n-Once you make supports dissapear, you can't get them back\n-The camera messes up where your mouse is poiting when you are building the coaster.\n\nThat said, I still have hope for this game. The devs really do seem like they care about the game, even if they have to work for the wonderful publishers of games like "Alone in the Dark Illumination" and "Haunted House: Cryptic Graves."\n\n\nSome things that lead me to have hope are:\n-They are planning to update the game a lot after launch\n-The overall engine seems like it is a decent base for the game\n-The park management and modding tools they have described are promising\n-Atari doesn't seem to be pushing them to add microtransactions\n-The devs seem to want to make a good game.\n-They said that the old way of making coasters will also be in the game (I'm pretty sure I heard this, but I don't remember where). When combined with the current coaster editor this should help the game a lot\nSource: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJxlP1GeAzw\n\nConclusion:\nFor now, stay away. I will be returning my copy. Wait to see how the game turns out, and if the devs are providing consistent and meaningful updates. If they get the game to a decent current state and are showing care to the game, I will purchace. Until then I'll be playing RCT3 and RCT 2. (screw RCT 3D and RCT 4 mobile :<)\n\nEDIT: Removed the part about the game launching in early access.

The controls are beyond poor and the physics are not realistic at all. There are tons of graphics/performance issues (which are to be expected in a beta), but rides fail for no reason whatsoever (i.e. work in one section during a test and fail the next test even though the track was unchanged) and whenever a ride crashes the train remains on the ground and makes the area around it invalid to place track there from then on. They should really consider trashing the current control layout and go for something similar to Theme Park Studio's, which is simpler and much more precise/powerful.

Well this is a Beta review first off, just a little FYI.\n\n(Beta 1 Review)\n\nSo lets get started if you ever was a fan of Rollercoaster tycoon 1,2, and maybe even 3. Then this is the game you have been waiting for, or is it. Well we currently are testing the first public beta, or atleast the people that pre-ordered the game are. It's limited to just the coaster builder system, the path builder system, and some props and the ablity to edit the terrain with out a grid system like in the old RCT games.\n\n(The Coaster Builder System)\n\nYou have several different coaster to try out and test.\n\nEach coast has a few options for the stations.\n\nYou can change the colors of your coaster in 3 different areas rails, core, and supports.\n\nYou can change some of your coasters trains.\n\nThe new coaster builder system is kinda like a string that you can pull and turn and twist in to a pretty crazy looking rollercoaster. It sure is not the easiest thing to use by any means, infact sometimes it down right frustrating. It really shouldnt be this hard to build a coaster. I really do like the new system tho it really allows you to make a one of a kind coaster. After messing around with the coaster builder, it did get easier to use and I kinda started to enjoy making these crazy coasters.\n\nTho with that being said I have seen some pretty crazy bugs with the new coaster system. The main bug I see is that the supports sometimes are missing where there is no reason for it to be missing and then sometimes the coaster supports are right in the middle of another peice of track.\n\nNot locked to a grid or a set of peices really does add to the over all freedom of the new coaster builder.\n\n\n(The Path Building System)\n\nYou get a lot of different paths to pick from you even get 3 different sizes.\n\nYou are able to do straight paths , curved paths, and que lines for your rides, tho it would seem you cant do curved que paths.\n\nYou can raise the path and make some really cool path systems, saddly tho no steps but they have said they were looking into it.\n\n\n(Props)\n\nNot much to say really you get a bunch of trees, some rocks, some statues, a few different trashcans, benchs, tables, light poles, even some halloween items.\n\nAbout the only thing that seemed off to me was their double flag poles where not the same ingame as they showed in the menu...\n\n(Peeps)\n\nYou see the peeps but they are just ghosted out they look much better then last time I saw them at PAX i think it was. They was kinda like power sliding every where.\n\n( HOW DOES IT RUN )\n\nWell it crashes a lot...... and i can not say this enough but i mean a ungodly amount. But remember this is a beta..... When it does start up and work it seems like the game has memory problem or something. I have 8 gb of DDR 3 and they recoment 6GB and i can watch it peg my memory out over just 3 coasters and some trees...... what about all them flat rides and peeps... i Still feel like they have alot of work to do before this is ready but then again maybe this is just a older version of the game they are leting us play on. I have faith they well make this game great so i would Recommend this game but i would atleast hold out till late nov as that is when beta 2 should be out and they will open more of the game out to the public to test out.\n\n","October 31, 2015","true","191.2"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

So far, I'm very much enjoying this with 18.5 hours played.\n\nScenarios\nI like these.  It is fun to have a pre-built park and take on different challenges. I hope they add more to this or even allowing players to create their own scenarios that other people can play.  Campaign and Sandbox mode also available.\n\nSocial Hub\nEasy to use and get other player's or friends rollercoaster creations in my game.  Amazing how talented some are with their custom rollercoasters.\n\nGameplay\nWhen I first started I went right into the game.  There were a few things I was annoyed that I couldn't do well, like how shops or rides were placed.  Once I took the time to actually go through the tutorial, I solved most of the issues I was having.  Take the time to go through the tutorial, it will help you and you can open any of the various tutorials at anytime in the options.  Like I didn't have snapping on at first until I realized I needed to turn it on by pressing N once to set it on.\n\nCoaster Building\nI found it difficult at first and it definately can use some work still.  The more you use it, the better you will get.  I'm sure this will be a feature that is heavily worked on throughout early access.\n\nPeeps\nA nice diverse bunch of peeps are within the game.  They give plenty of info of what they like and don't like.  As well as a number of variables depending on what they are doing in your park, eating, etc.  I found peeps to be the most buggy aspect of the game and the developers will need to improve them.  They graphically glitch out often like on ride cameras or sliding around when walking.\n\nGraphics Options\nI saw a lot of reviews saying they were having issues and listing beasty specs.  I have an average PC and I had no problems, minus frame drops here and there.  The frame drops seem to increase with the more peeps in the park or possibly just the park getting larger.  The developers will need to optimize, but it is still playable.  Make sure to look into the graphics settings where there are a variety of options.  There is one where you can favor fps and some others depending on what you are looking for.\n\nDevelopers\nThey do seem to be taking feedback seriously and giving updates.  Let's hope they keep that up as it is vital to most early access projects.\n\nUser Interface\nThe menus look fantastic!  Icons are easy to understand.  The second you get into the game,  you will understand what options are for what.\n\nMouse Movement\nGood.  The zoom in and out with the mouse wheel is sensitive until you get use to it.  I'd like to see edge-scrolling available like on the Sims.  Maybe there was an option for it, but I don't think I saw it.\n\nKeybindings\nYes!  They are available.  It sucks to get an early access title and those aren't available yet.  Luckily, they are here.\n\nPaths\nPaths are slightly tricky at first, but you will get better at them the more you play.  I think the developers can do some slight adjustments, but overall, the paths are decent.  The textures are attractive as well.\n\nRides, Objects, Terrain, Buildings\nThere is a good amount of rides, coasters, buildings, and objects available with a variety of themes (also consider Steam Workshop).  Coasters sometimes seem to freeze and stop running, but it usually corrects itself after a while.  The developers will want to look into that.  I was happy with the ride variety currently in the game.\n\nOverall Thoughts After 18 Hours\nThis is an enjoyable game and I wanted to keep playing it and growing my park.  There is tons of potential here to grow what is already a decent base for an early access title.  There is clearly some specific graphical bugs that can look silly and the developers will want to get on that as well as further optimization on a variety of features.\n\nI would recommend RollerCoaster Tycoon World and I'm rather surprised by the amount of very negative reviews.  Many with little time played.  Again, as I said above, I was a little annoyed at first when I started, but going through the tutorial solved many issues that I thought the game had.  The issue was that I though I could jump right in with no problems.  Take your time to learn how everything works and you will have fun!","April 4","true","18.5"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

I am tisht and don't normally pre-order games and usually wait until they are in a good sale, however I preordered this as soon as I heard it was being developed.  I will say that I also bought Planet Coster too and have been playing the alpha of that.  I have no bias and I actually want to have two great theme park games.  I will continue to edit this as the game develops.\n\nI've been playing theme park games for decades (yes, I am that old!!) and it's one of my favourite style of games.\n\nThe pre-realease weekend they did last year was a disaster and I was worried what game I would actually get for my money.  I anxiously waited for the next pre-release weekend until I saw that it was now released on "Early Access".   I guess they felt pressured to actually release something now that Planet Coaster was starting to do releases.\n\nAbout the game.  The game does have a lot of features in it already to enable you  to actually build and manage a theme park.  This is definately in Early Access as there are issues that need to be addressed and features that need to be tweaked, but I have not experienced so many issues like other players.\n\nPros\nLots of feature to enable you to buld and manage the park.\nA wide number of flat rides, coasters and shops to choose from.\nThe user content feature is amazing\n\nIssues to be addressed (in my humble opinion)\nImproved coaster building since pre-Early Access, but still is very fiddly and cumbersome to actually build a rollercoaster.  I'm sure with a lot of practice it will become easier, but even using the RCT like buttons to lay the track, it still isn't as easy and straight forward as RCT3.\nPath building needs to be worked on\nNeeds the ability to demolish in a draggable area.  This maybe there, but I can't get it to work.  Its a pain in the ♥♥♥ to delete every tree and bush to be able to put a ride down.\nIt's not so clear the benefit of the different size staff buildings.  Is there a coverage radius that they cover?\nI personally don't like being fored to have the entrances/exits fixed to the rides.\n\nShould you buy this game?  I would still say yes.  I know there are problems with it, some people have experienced lag which I haven't.  I have faith that Atari are listiening to the community and will be implementing the changes, requests and fixes as the game develops.  Since release they have already done a couple of updates and I hope that they continue the pace and release frequent updates and changes rather than waiting months.\n\nYes, there are features in Planet Coaster that this game doesn't have and there's no arguing that the Planet Coaster videos look amazing.  Like I said earlier, I'd like to have two great rollercoaster games as I'm sure they'll both have their strengths and weaknesses.  Time will tell how both games will be developed.  For now, I will be spending far more time plating Roller Coaster Tycoon World than I will Planet Coaster.","April 10","true","6.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Only have had the game crash about two times on me if your game is crashing it has nothing to do with the game, it's your computer.This game it has a very enjoyable game play. For a EA game it needs some improvements, one of the most common issues is people getting sick, after rides. The pathing is a bit rough. You have to use two hands to play the game but to be honest it's EA chill. Play the game, try it out for yourself. I think this game is great it has its quirks but I see it can be improved on. This is a game you can post on a form for fixes not just complain. Half of the games that come out now are in EA cause if they make enough money they will just stop developing it. This game is true EA right a form about your issues and give the developers time.

Now I haven't played Planet Coaster or the others that people have been mentioning in the post, So i have nothing to compare them with.\n\n\nThe controls are a little rough and need some refining but once you get used to them it's not too bad.\n\nThe Campaign mode needs work. the tutioral does not operate like it should.\n\nThere are issues with the animations of the people. sometimes you can see them fly out of the ride. gliding instead of walking. things that can be fixed. but not a complete deal breaker.\n\nRoller Coasters- Designing is fun. takes a few minutes to get used to the controls but once I did the fun began. However, there needs to be adjustment on the people because all my "Fun" coasters make everyone get off and throw up instead of jump for joy. even the pre-made ones you can install the people will get off and puke. I mean the one I made only has one loop and a spiral for crying out loud. how is that not Fun right???\n\nOverall I am having fun making a park and roller coasters.

I grew up with RCT getting my first one from a ceral box as a young child. I love RCT so That's how I'm apporaching this review. TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nThe game is buggy and has loads of issues. I've had texture problems on rides, rollercoaster work during testing than later not make it back to the station for no reason, disapearing sceneary, slowness, game systems just not working at all and a plethera of many, many other issues. The game has 6 different rollercoasters, and a handful of other rides that are mostly based on themes that you might not want in a generic park. This game is no where near release ready... but it's a prime subject for Early Access.\n\nWith a lot of games you know from the first few hours if a game has potential or not in Early Access, if it will ever get better or stay complete crap. I can say that RCTW is not the latter, this game has so much potential, it's just not there yet. As I stated above it has so many bugs and issues and lacks key mechanics like being able to tell janitors where they are alowed to go and where they should stay.\n\nThere's so many issues like how after getting off of a ride every single person on that ride will throw up. Also guests just pee everywhere, literally every where even outside of washrooms. You don't get enough feedback as to why somethign isn't working or why guests are unhappy or why they litter right beside a garbage can.\n\nAnd yet, this game is just as addicting as the others. I do recomend this game but only if you go into it knowing that this is not ready, no where near ready. It fees like an alpha. If you know that, and you will not go into it expecting something like RCT3 level of completeness than I recomend this.

I am tisht and don't normally pre-order games and usually wait until they are in a good sale, however I preordered this as soon as I heard it was being developed.  I will say that I also bought Planet Coster too and have been playing the alpha of that.  I have no bias and I actually want to have two great theme park games.  I will continue to edit this as the game develops.\n\nI've been playing theme park games for decades (yes, I am that old!!) and it's one of my favourite style of games.\n\nThe pre-realease weekend they did last year was a disaster and I was worried what game I would actually get for my money.  I anxiously waited for the next pre-release weekend until I saw that it was now released on "Early Access".   I guess they felt pressured to actually release something now that Planet Coaster was starting to do releases.\n\nAbout the game.  The game does have a lot of features in it already to enable you  to actually build and manage a theme park.  This is definately in Early Access as there are issues that need to be addressed and features that need to be tweaked, but I have not experienced so many issues like other players.\n\nPros\nLots of feature to enable you to buld and manage the park.\nA wide number of flat rides, coasters and shops to choose from.\nThe user content feature is amazing\n\nIssues to be addressed (in my humble opinion)\nImproved coaster building since pre-Early Access, but still is very fiddly and cumbersome to actually build a rollercoaster.  I'm sure with a lot of practice it will become easier, but even using the RCT like buttons to lay the track, it still isn't as easy and straight forward as RCT3.\nPath building needs to be worked on\nNeeds the ability to demolish in a draggable area.  This maybe there, but I can't get it to work.  Its a pain in the ♥♥♥ to delete every tree and bush to be able to put a ride down.\nIt's not so clear the benefit of the different size staff buildings.  Is there a coverage radius that they cover?\nI personally don't like being fored to have the entrances/exits fixed to the rides.\n\nShould you buy this game?  I would still say yes.  I know there are problems with it, some people have experienced lag which I haven't.  I have faith that Atari are listiening to the community and will be implementing the changes, requests and fixes as the game develops.  Since release they have already done a couple of updates and I hope that they continue the pace and release frequent updates and changes rather than waiting months.\n\nYes, there are features in Planet Coaster that this game doesn't have and there's no arguing that the Planet Coaster videos look amazing.  Like I said earlier, I'd like to have two great rollercoaster games as I'm sure they'll both have their strengths and weaknesses.  Time will tell how both games will be developed.  For now, I will be spending far more time plating Roller Coaster Tycoon World than I will Planet Coaster.","April 10","true","6.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Please don't listen to stupid Planet Coaster Fangirls/boys thats where the negative reviews are coming from. I have bought the game, and although it took me a few days to actually get on the game (57% bug) im on it now and its lagging slightly.

I was very excited about the RCTW project ever since I first heard the news that there was finally going to be a sequel. RCTW delivers everything you would expect in a modern RCT game. The greatest improvement of all is the absence of the grid. Everything in RCTW is placed and manipulated in a real time 3D environment. The Coaster Editor is the next biggest improvement. Gone are the days of piece-by-piece track building. In it's place, we have a powerful spline editor that makes creating coasters more advanced than ever before. It's entirely possible to build a track piece at any angle imaginable. And thirdly, we have an sphosticated UGC system in place to guarantee that players can create, share, and place virtually any kind of scenery object right into the game. I feel that my top needs have been met so far by RCTW and the project has a very hopeful future ahead. I'm very pleased to be a part of the experience and I'm excited to see this project carry on the legacy of my favorite theme park sim franchise.","April 18","true","213.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","3","10","0","0"

There are a few things i dont like such as the paths and the way the roller coaster track reconnects when you delete, but all-in-all, it\'s a lot better. Smoother graphics is the main thing you would notice if compared to the older games and the free build roller coaster building gives a lot more oppurtunities for building. Also I think the rating needs to be changed. The simplest coaster will have an extreme intesity and very low excitment.

The release date is 12/29/2015 which is almost TWO months prior to realease (from 10/31/2015).  Apologies to the prior reviewers as I did not see the first release date of 12/10/2015.\n\nIs it ready?  No, but I think in TWO months it could be.  There are some definite issues in the current state.\n\nCoaster building is very different from the prior RTC games.  I wouldn't say it's necessarily harder, just different.  It's just going to take some time to get used to it.  The camera / scrolling needs some work in that it isn't intuitive or user-friendly (for me).  I did not experience any lag.\n\nThere isn't much else to review at this point.  All-in-all I think the game looks like it could be great.  I think it would have been nice to know what the developer's intent was with this beta weekend...to test a particular aspect of the game or just give us a small taste of what the game has to offer?\n\nWhile I'm in the minority for recommending the game, I do so with the caveat that we still have two months prior to release.  There is another beta weekend in December if I'm not mistaken and I feel that will be a better indicator of how we'll see the finished product.","October 31, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","2"

Don't expect everything they made by now is given to you on a dish.\n\nThe game looks incomplete, yes, does it look unfit to be released by 10 Dec? Maybe. There are a few things to consider here before you go and stab the devs in the kidney. The game is in beta and as we all know, most features are either locked or to be added at a later date. Big features were promised such as multiplayer, tunnels, various coaster types and flatrides, and other big features. If you payed attention to the Rollercoaster Tycoon blog Atari and NVizzio even stated that they want to ship the main game with the main concept by the end of the year and to release the big features through free content updates. Big features like multiplayer and tunnels (Cities Skylines devs made a good explanation for tunnels in general) are really time consuming things and require weeks or even months of extra coding and prepping for. They are stressed for time and if you remember the trailer earlier this year (Which was really bad) Atari came under fire by the community by how it looks. Plus the game was to be released by mid this year but was delayed. So do give them some sympathy for what situation they are currently in. Do take some time to read the the Rollercoaster Tycoon Blogs on their website. In fact they also stated on their blogs:  "The RollerCoaster Tycoon World Beta is a technical demo focusing on our coaster building system and will show tycoons just a small taste of the sandbox experience and great parks you will be able to build when the game launches."  Source:  RCTW Blog #21[www.rollercoastertycoon.com] More proof to show that tons of the content in the game is locked.\n\nThank you for reading!\n\nREVIEW\nBETA WEEKEND 1\n\nThe game looks good so far, the coaster editor is by far the best thing I have ever seen and when the beta came out. I really just wanted to get my hands on the coaster editor and see how it works. I was indeed satisfied and I wasn't expecting anything else besides the coaster editor. There are a few bugs and glitches with various derailments, especially with the wooden coaster. Building a the coaster was a bit weird at first but I got the hang of it once I fiddled around abit. Editing the coaster was a bit buggy and especially on wooden coasters you couldn't make banked curves going down a slope so I assume that may be fixed by the next beta that is in November. Each train car on the coaster can be edited, recoloured and made different. So you could have a specific coaster train style or you could just make a rainbow train for your coaster. Controls are similar to Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.The terrain deformation is spot on and the water was really smooth but the texture for the water was a bit weird. Making the water properly transparent may make it look better. The path creation is really nice, the there were a few situations where the I see overlapping connected paths but mostly it was good. The queue path railings had a few connection glitches when turning it about more than 90 degrees. There were various preformance issues but that may be my pc talking to me and sometimes when I left the game to the main menu it would glitch out the hud. Loading time is ok.\n\nDo I recommend this game?\n\nIf you are skeptical about pre-orders thats your choice but for this beta weekend 1 you are only expecting to get the coaster editor, paths, terrain deformation and some scenery. The game is exceptionly buggy but its a good step forward in the right direction, it is a beta afterall. I will be updating this review once the next beta weekend comes out at the end of November but for me, most of the games features are locked and most of them are not going to be unlocked till game's release. They are promising big and free content updates after the release on the 10 December. So far they are promising Multiplayer and tunnels post release day and thats like 1/10th of what they plan to add afterwards. Once the game lives up to standards (Which already almost is) You can bet your money its really a good game.\n\nMy First Impressions\nhttps://youtu.be/I0ATCXs_Bx0\n\n[Video still uploading]\n\nAny unnecessary criticism will be deleted. Unless you can justify that I am indeed wrong please have at it.","October 31, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

BUT of course it's no where near finished yet.\nI don't know exactly how they're going to finish the game within 40 days but you have to know too, that we saw much more in the footage they've shown us.\nThis means:\nThe beta is reduced in functionality ON PURPOSE!\nThey stripped any options (you can't change resolution and stuff), there's no campaign yet, no goals, nothing.\n\nAll you can do yet is to start the sandbox mode and even the sandbox mode isn't fully implemented. Peeps look like ghosts, they have no skins. You can't build any houses like burger or drink shops.\nYou can build:\nScenery like trees, bushes, etc\nUseful stuff like lamps, trash bins, banks, etc\nPaths, rounded paths and queues (not rounded yet, I don't know why)\nOf course, coasters.\nYou can build coasters of course. But you can only build some types of coasters (like 5 or so). I guess, they will add more to the finished game.\nMost people think that the coaster editor is not good and too hard to use. I disagree. Even though I have to admit that it needs some time to get used to it, it's a VERY powerful tool to create coasters and with a little bit of training you can truly built your dream's rollercoaster. The spline based editor lets you create anything possible (within the physical possibilities, of course). From high curves to amazing loops. And you can set lifts, brakes, boosts and block brakes anywhere you want (even in a loop :P). That's amazing too.\n\nThe user interface looks not finished yet. It looks like an alpha but again: They've shown more in their footage.\nFrom what I have seen now, I'm still impressed. Yes, there is not much to do yet. And yes, it looks not finished yet and it also doesn't look like they're going to finish the game within time.\nBut there is still a second beta weekend to come. And I expect that they will add far more functionality to the game then which is basically ready but just not enabled yet.\n\nThey want us to test the coaster editor mainly. To give feedback on how it works and how it feels. They will reduce complexity on controls a bit because people are complaining. I don't understand most of them, but well, that's how things work.\n\nThere are some cons though:\nCamera movement feels weird, especially when building coasters. It makes it harder to place your tracks because when you zoom in to check what direction your coaster is going, the coaster moves away from the point you've pointed at previously. Please fix that.\nThere are some bugs (of course, it's a beta) like occasionally the 1st person view is not working. Or sometimes the coaster crash without any obvious reason. I don't know if there was just too much G-force on them or the track was bugged, but I would appreciate feedback on where and how and why the coaster has crashed. And maybe a G-force graph too.\nThere are some graphical glitches sometimes. When you startup the game it seems to be buggy (have a look at my uploaded screenshots)\nPerformance is not good at all. I have a GTX 670 running but my FPS are somewhere between 20 and 45 (max 60). The game looks fine, but it doesn't look THAT fine that it could explain that low fps. I hope that they will improve performance.\nWell, that's all I can think of for now. I will add more if I find more to say.","October 31, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Now we get to have a massive flood of User Generated Content thrown at it via the workshop. My experience with the workshop implementation has been pleasing. I'm happy with the 'social hub' button.\n\nNvizzio definitely listened to the complaints from October. Every complaint of my has been eliminated.\n\nIt's very clear that the game was nowhere near ready for full release... but it's leaps and bounds more solid than the engine preview was. The coaster builder now has classic building style as well as the freeform method... and it's seamless; you can, say, build the lift chain using the classic style, and then put in the first drop using freeform, and then finish it off with classic. Fantastic work.\n\nI was able to get my first coaster with excellent ratings knocked out in under 20min... something that took me nearly 4 hours to do during the engine preview weekend. This is a massive improvement. I do kinda miss the live intensity preview on the track building - instead, I have to guess if it's going to work, go with it, finish the track, test it, and tweak it to perfection.\n\nThe prebuild blueprints of coasters need to be looked at by the devs, as they end up testing as complete garbage on many of them - my guess is that they were designed with the older system that they had.\n\nAchievements... *fixed. Enjoy!\n\nCamera control is finally able to be completely bound to the mouse, which is a giant relief - that was one of my chief complaints in the preview. In minutes I was able to master the control and look at things exactly how I wanted, instead of fighting it the whole time.\n\nBugs happen - it's in early access. Textures go funky, AI goes stupid, and things can get weird. I've seen full released games with more issues than this, but the RCT legacy deserves nothing less than perfect; and it's up to the fans to help Nvizzio and Atari make that happen.\n\nPlay the game, and tell them when something goes wrong, or right, or weird... just don't expect them to pull up a Ouiji board to guess what is happening to everyone... because sometimes it takes the stars to align to highlight a problem - and that's where crowdsourced testing (Early Access) plays the biggest benefit. We all win when you share your grievances and pleasures.\n\nThe day 1 patch has improved upon many of the bugs. Lots of new content was added, as well. This shows much potential for the future of the game.","October 31, 2015","true","51.5"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

I have to be honest and say that there are definitely issues, BUT it is still good.  There are some issues with the graphics being a little rough around the edges and the staff need more options.  It is good to play another coaster game and the new coaster design is pretty good.\n\nIt is early access and I wish it wasn't, but that means that I don't have to settle with what I have.  I can make recommendations and expect them to be applied to the game.\n\n***I am editing this to be more speific about the errors so they can be fixed!***\n\n- The Janitors need help.  I have 16 of them and they get confused and much of my park remains filthy.  There use to be an option to drag and drop them and also to designate a certain area for them to focus cleaning.  That needs to come back.  I believe thats an absolute necessity.\n\n- The benches are confusing.  When I first put them down only a couple of people used them ( I have many benches).  Not only that but the guests were walking through the benches.  So, I moved them to the grass.  No one walked through them anymore, but the benches aren't even being used now.\n\n- The mechanics are as bad as the janitors.  I have 13 of them and they wonder about without a clue as to what they need to do ( most of the time).  I will have a ride break down and stay that way for ingame days before someone fixes it.  That makes no sense, because I have more mechanics than I do rides and plenty of paths for them to easily access the broken ride.\n\n-  Some of the outlines on the guests are wonky.  You know, when you click on them and get close enough you can see the white outline?  Yeah, some of those are just not right.\n\n- I am not sure the info kiosk updates when new stuff is built.  I have people wondering around lost.\n\n- Why are my people angry about the souvenir stalls? They say it will have to do...Is this because it doesn't target their age-group?  Is it the prices?  Is it the color or theme?  Speaking of color and theme; these should be changeable via the actual building or, at least, the color.  All my hats are blue!!!  That is not okay.\n\n- Placement of buildings frustrates me to no end.  Why can't I snap them to pathways?  Why must I pull them back from the path and make another path to them?  To me, that is not okay.\n\n- There definitely needs to be a better bulldozer tool for mass-destruction.\n\n- There also needs to be subways and such. Also water rides.

To be honest I had struggles if I should give the game ago- I have read negative reviews different platforms and I was worried it would be a disaster; now I have tried the game and I have the following honest feedbacks:\n\nI started the series since RCT1, enjoyed RCT2 and loved RCT3.\n\nI do honestly hoped that RTCW, 10 years after the release of RCT3 would have been sculpted and upgarded much and have noticed the followings:\n\nPEEPS.\npeeps look terrible in RCTW. I would zoom in RCT3 and just look at happy peeps buying balloons/popping their balloons etc but now I just want to zoom out because they look like zombies. In my opinion, they need more life.\n\nROADS.\nhonestly think its a nice touch for the shift/scroll to lower/elevate ramps, it was a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to calculate how much angle the ramp for older version. I think this gesture worked. Nice touch for adjusting road widths/ but it is difficult to connect wide roads to attractions/facilities or back to a single sized road.\n\nCOASTER BUILDER.\nok. I have read lots of bad reviews for the coaster builder. After I tried it out myself, I think it is not as bad. The control might NOT be for beginners/new RCT players, but if you were an EXPERIENCED RCT player, I do think the mechanical tool option helped A LOT, esp. to add chained/brakes tracks in a clear manner. I think the tool box is quite neat to me, but I do understand it may cause beginners a lot of confusion.\n\nWORKERS. (JANITORS/TECHNICIANS)\nvery nice touch. to just add a hub and let them manage themselves. I dont care if they slack tbh. I just dont care.\n\nRESTAURANTS.\ninteresting blend of food and specialities restaurants- but I think the designs are a bit lazy for different themes, and I hope they could be attached to paths at a closer distance. (and i do secretly enjoy the fact that you can manage the amount of sauce/salt/edit the menu in RCT3)\n\nShift+mouse scroll to rotate: i prefer a 90degress rotation in default than the default scroll-till-you-get-the-perfect-angle mode. saves my time. and some players (me) still prefer doing plannings on grid.\n\nSnap tool is a bit off - somtimes I misplaced benches outside the path and I dont like it.\n\nbetter to add a drop down menu- to filter themes. showing 4 burger shops in a row with different themes is not kool.\n\nTERRIN TOOLS.\nbrilliant.\n\nATTRACTIONS.\nI MISS THE SWAN BOATS AND METRO TRAINS TO TOUR AROUND PARK.\n\nSTATISTICS.\nvery clear way of presenting, loan is reasonable.\n\nSPECIAL LOTS.\nI appreciate the plaza blocks that are saved as pre-made blueprinted, saved me a lot of time and they are done beautifully.\n\nI MISS THE OPTION TO RE- PLACE ENTRANCE/EXITS. sometimes the location is just not right.\n\nCONCLUSION.\nI think. for 10 years, the game does not evolve as much as I expected it to be (thinking about from RCT2 to RCT3 guys.... the sudden leap from axonometric cubes to first person camera view on rides. thats innovation.) except from the fact that you can change the graphics settings to "very high level of detail" and "very far detailed shadow". This is not a rendering software, and high level of renders always make the game slow/crash. I would appreciate if more effort is put into details (design of rides) and new gameplay experience (like soak and wild for RCT3). It also remided me how great RCT3 is... especially at that time.\n\nI have a neutral feeling for this game, I remained nostalgic about the old days I spent managing my park, so YES I recommend for long-term RCT players, but maybe a NO for beginners.","May 25","true","4.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","2","8","2","0"

That said, from what I see from forums, this game will not be as popular as the original trilogy because the coaster designer is much more complex to use than in previous itterations.\n\nThere are only 7 or 8 different coaster types currently present in RCTW and many classics from the second and even first games are missing. My guess is that additional coaster types will be offered via paid DLC, the thought leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but I can't think of another reason why certain 'cornerstone' rollercoasters such as corkscrew coasters aren't available already.\n\nThe 'innovative' Spline based coaster designer is an interesting take on coaster design, it works well if you plan on building a coaster without any inversions. However, as soon as you plan on including corkscrews, loops or any other inversion. You will almost instantly get frustrated. I found it extremely difficult to create straight lines of coaster track, perhaps because the track is always attached to your cursor before you place it, and while trying to move around simultaneously, the track quickly becomes twisted and messed up. There is a premade loop that can be used, however it does not look realistic and is way too steep. The other premade track piece is a 'vertical corkscrew'. Were the developers smoking crack when they came up with that one?\n\nOne of the only things that made me actually feel like I was playing a RollerCoaster Tycoon series game was when it came to choosing the colour design of the coaster. Perhaps this is because they did little to no innovation in this area, as none was needed.\n\nI designed a hypercoaster in RCTW that seemed fairly successful in design, but the test statistics showed that the ride was hardly 'fun' at all. I know for certain that this coaster would've had atleast 5 excitement if I had made it with any of the original games.\nIt was impossible for me to judge the physics engine this game has because it was impossible to have the coaster running while maintaining a decent framerate. This, despite my computer exceeding the system requirements of the game.\n\nThere is no Options menu and there is no way to change the resolution, change graphics settings or even any audio settings. I yearn for the ability to mute the annoying music that comes on if you scroll out far enough. As well, the sounds that I am assuming come from the rollercoaster stations are really obnoxious and need to be changed. However this may work itself out as more features and other sounds are added.\n\nControlling the game is a bit of hit and miss, You move around the map with the arrow keys or WASD, I was unable to move around by dragging my cursor to the edge of the screen, something I think is critical for this kind of game.\n\nThere are a large variety of paths in the game and the system seems to be fairly fleshed out and competent.\n\nAll in all, if the developers manage a way to include a simplified coaster designer, in the vein of the coaster designer from the original games, I feel this game will see massive success. Aesthetically pleasing and once fully optimized, I will give this game another shot.\n\nPros\n+decent graphics\n+complex coaster designer\n+painting coaster track\n+fleshed out path system\n\nCons\n-annoying sound design\n-complex coaster designer\n-limited amount of coaster types\n-vertical corkscrew will haunt my dreams\n-no corkscrew/arrow dynamics coasters\n-coaster statistics function completely different\n-poor optimization\n-no options menu (albeit this is beta, would be nice to mute audio)\n-moving around is awkward","October 30, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

RollerCoasterTycoon in general is created by Frontier, but for some reason this one is not created by them.  Butttttt that's not a entirely bad.  Nvizzio Developed this game and gave us the early access to the game.  Of course it's not finish full of bugs and myself and a whole lot of other people probably have alot of suggestions they should add to the game, I'm not sure how to reach them but hopefully they will reach out to us by not only giving us early access to the game but a feed channel to listen to us the gamers.  Overall the game isn't bad but its not to good.  It's a new RCT but it don't feel like RTC if you know what I mean. The great thing about this game is the customizable scenary and rollercoasters.  The bad thing is there are really low height restrictments, and the lack of customizing the thrill rides that we could customize such as observation towers, Mini Golf, Go-Karts ECT. But again it's an early access so I can't really complain to much about this.  I can't wait to see what the finish product will have.\n\n\nAgain its a new RCT game that you may or may not like.

Again, finnicky and tough to get the hang of, but it's a lot of fun! It's really a hit or miss in the long run, if you like Rollercoaster Tycoon, give it a whirl if you want, but if you don't, then don't bother with it honestly because there's nothing here for you unless you are a fan of the series as I am myself since day one. All in all, to my personal preference, I am loving it so far, and I think it may have a bright future with how the devs are handling there blogs lately, perhaps a good direction towards a wonderful position for the game. It's a blast! But most definitely buy at your own risk, not for everybody but if you love Rollercoaster Tycoon like myself, give it a go guys!\n\nEDIT: After banking a few more hours up, I maxed the settings and I will agree with some of the reviews, the graphics are just barely better than RCT3 in some situations, but the performance wasn't impaced all that much for me even with my ancient components, being an old Core2 Q9400, two 560's, and an nForce 790i FTW mobo, it did lag in some places but overall it did quite well, which kind of surprised be with the system requirements it lists. Overall however, if they updated the graphics, added more coasters and rides, and tweaked the optomiization for a little smoother flow it'll be perfect for me personally.

Well, maybe not just today.\n\nOf course, many features are currently not available, as I'm looking foward to learn new game's basics, while the engineers are sitting and drinking coffee. Now to buisness...\n\nGeneral interface(IU), main or in-game menu are very good, simple to use and understand. Camera control is overall very good, but for when building coaster, it moves a bit too much automatically(even with option off). Graphics are very good but will need a little work on shadow and a few textures(nothing dramatic). Environment is great to play in and main backdrops are nice, even if the camera don't allow too much ''out-of-park'' pullback. Land modifications is simple, low cost, working fine, but need scenery auto-removal Scenery is somewhat limited but nice, and hoping for the community to pick on this, with more themes to come soon.\n\nItems controls and locations placement, including in height are easy to use and usually correct on position. Moving tool is very good, very usefull. Most other tools are nice and easy, like grid and snap options. Path building and path objects are still a bid tricky with placement limits(maybe my rides are too close to path, blocking scenery placement).\n\nFlat rides count is OK for this early version, with a good choice of coasters, shops and other management building. Many options for buildings and rides management are missing. Zoning for personnel is missing. Pay grade and training for personnel is missing.\n\nCoaster design control is simply amazing, allowing you to build practically what you want, with some limits to tracks placement not allowing volontary errors to correct afterward. Piece-by-piece placement is still actual, and was hoping for it(got it!). Node control is stunning and very easy to use, splines based coaster are just the best. On board camera could be a little smoother. Coasters details are very good, but missing color choice for cars and stations. Stations control are still limited and need some improvement, but overall good. Coaster building NEEDS a auto-removal for scenary(trees and bushes) and a ground grid snapping feature.\n\nEconomy is quite simple, but will require lots of tweaking, I get many stores and restaurants that don't get many visit, even if the demand is high and place in the right location. Love the end day pay, instead of continual flow. Budget is easy to read and quite detailed. Missing lots of features for merchendinsing and sales choice control in stalls, and other venues. Missing side incomes(like on ride photo sections). Missing tech tree and research.\n\nPeeps and personnal will need some work for behaviors, skin textures, control and options(like zoning and pay). I miss the candy side of previous opus for peeps. No choice for entertainers costumes is not fun. Mainly, the people's toughts are accurates and will spend based on need and want. Groups and family are missing babdly. Here again, nothing dramatic, and nothing from stopping me to build.\n\nMany other features are in planning and will be greatly welcome, like transport rides. RCT3 was simply alone in it's category, and well filled with custom objects, which will come in time for RCTW. Also, they will want to put sequels, like water rides and animals out to make a few more sure bucks out of us in the future, which I agree too, but WILL NOT PAY for micro download(DLC). MISSING IN-GAME RECORDER(A ABSOLUTE MUST).\n\nOverall, after years of patience and waiting, I give it a 8,2/10 score compared to RCT3(10/10), since it's early, it's very good, and will improove greatly. The game foundation is very strong. Community, Tycoons as well as wannabe Tycoons will rally behind this title and it's going to become a classic as well as a cash mountain for Atari. GREAT GAME. This tittle is good for all ages. Thank you Atari, but not for the waiting years.\n\n***Line start here***\n***Waiting time at this point: 5 years***\n***Keep head and arms inside the vehicule at all time***\n***Kindly remain seated untill complete stop.***\n\nAbbittibbi","April 2","true","96.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It's fun to play and never really boring when you start.I think to many people all ways forget about this game because of frontiers spiritual successor to rct3 planet coaster which is in its alpha.When the beta came out I thought it was good but needed vast improvements. This is also sort of how I feel about the early access version but some improvements have been added.\n\nPros\nGood and powerful coaster editor that is spline based.\nPiece by piece system for casual players.\nGreat UGC and tools overall.\nRealistic graphics and good looking shadows.\nCan hit 60fps.\n\nCons.\nNot that great for making dark rides.\nSpline based Coaster editor can feel a bit finicky at times\nLack of custom music and themes in game not on the workshop.\nbugs\nThe UI is a bit bland.\n\nSo overall RCTW is a good game. It's not perfect but I will stick by it until it comes out.. unless they abandon it, like astroids outpost!\n\n7\10","March 30","true","28.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I would like to point out some issues as of today that I know people are curious about considering all the upset reviews.  I have always loved these titles. So, I noticed reading comments that alot of people are upset with how the staff you place in your park are not great. From playing I see what they mean, but! They do get it done, although it takes time... I never really saw negative effects to my parks score. Or gotten notifications that the park was to messy. I had alot of complaints about there not being enough room as in pathways and things of that nature still no real effect on my overall score but I am sure that is something that can be fixed by simply making the park larger. And I look forward to figuring that out.  I took a picture of my park to display my overall score and all the annoying notifications everyones speaking of but I dont think i can post that here, but it shows my score is great although pesky notifications are there regarding the park staff being to low and stuff. As far as Roller coaster designing goes I am absolutely impressed!!!! The amount of control we have now when creating coasters is amazing absolutely great job done there. I have come to notice that getting the coasters just right takes some trial and error.  So far each coaster I have made is leading to puking guests. But they still ride it somehow lol. They give you pre-built track peices but you by no means have to use them. You can design whatever you want by simply editing a node this allows you to twist and turn or add speed boosters or breaks to tracks and it is very easy to use. I have not figured out if you can go underground with them yet that was always a favorite of mine. And yes there are pre-built tracks if you prefer that.","April 16","true","35.8"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
