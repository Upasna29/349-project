The final game in the trilogy.  Like some action RPG's?  Like Diablo games?  This game is for you.  Absolutely fantastic dialog.  Funny stuff.  I've completed all 3 games and still wanting more.

After seeing many negative reviews on the game, i decided to hold off. Playing the game now on pc, i don't see what the whole fuss was about. This is the same tried and true deathspank formula packaged in a new adventure. The only concern was the difficulty of the game. I died many MANY more times in this game then i did in the first two combined. This game is a little bit more linear when it comes to paths to take, but this may be a positive or a negative to some. Game length was fair, seeing how this was a 15 dollar arcade game. I believe i beat the game in about 8 or 9 hours, and this is attempting every quest and collecting everything possible. If your a deathspank fan i would recommend this game to you in a heartbeat. Do not let the negative reviews sway you.","November 4, 2014","true","8.3"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

I don't know who thought the idea of "mouse buttons move unless you click a target and then they attack" was a good idea, but every game I've played just shows it's awkward.  It's only saved by the reflection system and the ability to abuse the hell out of the very basic game play mechanics (rewarding in its own way).\n\nAs to the actual scripting, the voice acting is good, and Deathspank himself is of course hammy, over-the-top and very entertaining.  Good, silly dialogue.\n\nYou can really tell it was never meant for PC by the layout and style.

I'm a big fan of those Diablo 2 type games., which the Baconing is. The humour of this game, with the dialogue all being hilariously fully voiced by talented vocal actors is a real joy. It's a heavy dose of parody, with a good dash of genuine wit. The second wonderful thing about this game is the art. I'm not one to get gushy about art, but the quality and the variety is really stunning.\n\nThe cons are this though; The gameplay, specifically the difficulty (through awkwardness/poor design choices) , does not match the game style. I can see Futurama watchers firing up this game, perhaps after taking a long pull on a ...cigar. This will not go well for them: the combat is brutal. Ranged attackers can brutally kill you from off screen in less than two seconds with their homing bulets, which to withstand requires shielding the *instant* the projectile would hit. Melee combat is not helped with click to move.

The second one was not as good, but still okay.  The Baconing I just do not like. The first two games are basically casual with their playing style.  Something you can just pick up and play as a good time killer.  Unfortunately this time out they have introduced grinding for some reason.  Monsters go from being a good fight to killing you repeatedly until you can get decent equipment to face them with.  Another problem is the fact that other monsters will be "shooting" you from offscreen, causing massive damage plus slowing you, PLUS causing damage over time with poison.  It just completely wrecks any enjoyment that you could have playing.  A disappointment all the way around.  Unless they can bring back the entertainment value of the first game, I hope to never see Deathspank again.","December 5, 2014","false","10.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

It's also colorful and fun and reminds me of some fo the more twisted cartoons of my youth like Ren and Stimpy, Invader Zim and The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy.\n\nThe Baconing is a pretty simple game at its core, but has more complex equipment and item systems than what I was expecting.

The gameplay lacks here, since enemies often use ranged attacks out of frame to kill you. Where two two earlier games allowed the story-telling to be in focus and the dialogue options felt more interesting than just progressing The Baconing fails. However, it is still good for a few chuckles and while I loathe when achievements are tacked on for playing games on the hardest difficulty I can still say it's worth a playthrough.

The graphical style of the game is somewhat unique. Many background objects look like props in a play and the game overall has a bit of a cartoonish look. The world is a bit weird and it looks like you're moving on roller, because the land is always crooked.\n\nThe gameplay is very combat heavy, but the combat isn't that much fun. You die quite fast on the harder difficulties and you have to block a lot. You can also reflect projectiles the enemies shoot at you with the shield, but you have to time it right. You have 2 weapon sets and you can quickly switch between them anytime you want. Each weapon set has two weapons that you can choose yourself. I used the other weapon set for normal weapons and the other one for Justice weapons. Justice weapons have a powerful special attack, which can be used when you fill your Justice bar by hitting enemies and blocking at the right time. The game also has a local co-op so you can play with a friend. One player is always playing as Deathspank, but the other player can choose one character out of 4 (5 if you have the DLC).\n\nThe few RPG elements the game has consist of collecting gear and leveling up and then choosing a hero card that boosts damage, health or some other thing. The levels mainly enable you to wear better gear and that's pretty much it. The gear system is pretty stupid, because you almost always get a better gear set when you go to a new area and then the old gear set becomes useless. Same goes for weapons and few consumables.\n\nThe game has an economy system, which doesn't really make sense. You get money from enemies and also by grinding your useless items and the only thing worth buying with the money is more consumables, because the weapon vendor only sells you items you've previously had. I only had to buy a few potions during my playthrough, so I had lots of money that I had no use for.\n\nThe strongest part of the game and the reason I liked the game, despite all its problems, is the humor and dialogue. The characters are quite funny and a lot of the dialogue consists of silliness. There are lots of somewhat random moments as well like en. So if you like that kind of humor and don't mind the somewhat dull combat, I recommend playing the game. The combat isn't that bad, if you have a friend to play with.","December 4, 2013","true","11.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The settings are mostly interesting and they change at a decent pace. Humour is derived from decently written dialoque as well as absurd enviroments, items and creatures. Main gameplay revolves around killing numerous amounts of baddies.\n\nThough the visual aesthetic is generally appealing, the simple gameplay gets really repetitive quick. Unfortunately, same goes for the humour. RPG's are really good targets for parody, but it seems like the Baconing misses the point on occasion and when it hits the target, it doesn't quite have the right delivery. The voice acting of the main character gets really grating by the end, even though the game isn't that long.\n\nOn top of that, the Baconing was clearly made for a controller in mind. Though playing with mouse and keyboard is serviceable, it is occasionally clunky and can get annoying in big group fights.","November 27, 2013","false","17.6"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

That's not to say that hack-and-slash, loot-driven action RPGs don't have depth. Instead, I'm saying that the game makes the act of clicking on monsters a tedious chore. The humor is juvenile at best and poorly delivered at its worst. The combat is completely monotonous and never feels engaging beyond the act of "click a monster a bunch and its dead." The skills are uninteresting and the map layouts are boring and basic.\n\nGames in this genre, at their best, are frantic, engaging and can provide a lot of depth in the development of your character. They often create very immersive, interesting worlds and playing them is often an extremely addicting activity. The Baconing has none of these qualities and can pretty much be dismissed as a time-waster, should you ever find it for the right price ($1.99 or lower would be my suggestion).\n\nDon't bother; there are plenty of far better games in this genre on Steam that offer a lot more for the same or a lower price.","March 22, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

This game is a pain in the ***, it's totally broken and not enjoyable at all.\nNot worth even worth 1â‚¬ as the developer doesn't care at all (multiple reviews stating that it doesn't work for them, no updates since...

And I regret it so much... Before being able to actually play I had to verify my game cache because it crashed on launch. After close to 1h I ended my first playing session and the next time I wanted to continue (weeks or even months later) ... same thing again, but this time, I had no internet connection, so I couldn't use the verify game cache fix. NICE!\nWell today I wanted to play again (it's been months since I played last time), this time it actually worked - for 10 minutes. Then it crashed again. This game is a pain in the ***, it's totally broken and not enjoyable at all.\nNot worth even worth 1â‚¬ as the developer doesn't care at all (multiple reviews stating that it doesn't work for them, no updates since... I don't know, there has never been an update after my purchase). IF it would work, it seems to be a nice game, if you liked the previous titles, but it doesn't so skip this.","April 10, 2015","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is ok in an over-the-top ridiculous kind of way, some of it is sort of funny. The RPG elements are super light, the loot system is very shallow to the point that you can essentially ignore it. After the first zone you realize that each zone is going to follow the same exact formula. Some quests have you running back through areas you already cleared, which at times can seem like an annoying way to extend the hours the game has to offer.\n\nThe worst part about this game is that the combat is extremely clumsy feeling. You must be quick and have timing down with your shield bash to win in the encounters, but the inputs feel laggy and you often miss the enemies for no good reason. Its the main part of the game, and it is implemented badly. This makes the game pretty challenging at times. Challenging is fine, but challenging because the controls are bad is not.\n\nOverall, everything feels rushed. I had heard good things about this series, but this is not the one to get into.","July 12, 2015","false","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews. An hour isn't very long to judge a game on, so think of this as more of a first impression, and take this review in the spirit in which it's given. Be sure to read other reviews from players who have spent more time in the game.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 20\nThe Baconing\nPurchase Date: 10/17/2014\n\nI picked up The Baconing as part of a Humble Bundle.  I didn't realize until after I had played that this is actually the 3rd of a series of games featuring DeathSpank.   Looking back I could see where the game was making reference to prior games, but at the same time it isn't strictly necessary to have played the other 2.\n\nGameplay reminded me of Diablo II, but simpler in nature.  Actually I think Torchlight would be the better comparison here.  There is a huge emphasis on combat, and you will be frequently swarmed with enemies.  Expect to die a lot.  I started playing on Normal difficulty, and even at that level I was dying really often.  In some ways it was kind of annoying because enemies would shoot ranged weapons at me from off the screen, while I'm also getting attacked at close quarters.  Fortunately dying has very little consequence in this game; it just zaps you back to your last checkpoint minus some cash.\n\nI really liked the art style of the game.  Everything is cell shaded, which reminds me somewhat of Borderlands, but things are also drawn in this psuedo 2d style, like everything is a cardboard cutout.  When you look at things from the front they are drawn in, but as you get close and see from above everything looks like a cardboard cutout.  I'm not really doing it justice in the way I describe it, but it looks neat as you are running around.\n\nI mentioned the gameplay being compared to Diablo II, not only because of the constant combat, but also the emphasis on loot.  As you win fights you are constantly picking up loot.  Rather than having to sell loot you can just use your 'grinder' to grind the items down for instant cash.  Also there is an option to auto-equip armor that is of higher level.  It definitely keeps you from having to spend too much time on inventory management.\n\nAnother interesting aspect is you'll come across fortune cookies which you can use in your quest log to get hints if you are stuck.  That said, the quests were really simple in the hour that I played.  Perhaps the game adds more puzzles in later, but I get the feeling they are keeping things intentionally simple.\n\nI say this because DeathSpank is an idiot.  Playing DeathSpank reminded me of watching Inspector Gadget as a kid.  But that's really the whole point of the game, and it's what will make or break the game for you.  The game is full of humor all centered around what a complete doofus DeathSpank is.  DeathSpank is also voice acted, and I think they did a really good job here.  But if you like your games a little more serious or don't get into the "bumbling idiot who still manages to win the day" kind of humor, then you won't really enjoy The Baconing.\n\nOne small complaint I have is the game did crash on me at one point after I clicked inside of my second monitor which caused the game to minimize.  When I tried to restore the game window it crashed.  I only had it happen the one time, but it makes me think this game may be not very alt-tab friendly.  Also, I played the game with mouse and keyboard, but it's pretty apparent that you are better off playing with a controller.\n\nMy main concern about the game is how (or if) the gameplay evolves as you progress through the story.  I had fun for the time I played, but I can see where it would get old if all you do is grind your way through the game.  While the story has it's humor and charm, it's also very simple, and the quests I played were basic fetch quests.  I hope the game offers a little more variety or puzzle solving as it moves forward.\n\nEven with my concerns, I still liked the game enough to recommend it.","July 14, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What isn't is the "local co-op". Something that doesn't really appear on all those trailers touting the extra playable characters and sidekicks to the main character. What makes it worse is the amount of searching you have to do just to get a straight answer as to what EXACTLY "local co-op" means for a game whose amuzing storyline and colourful, action-packed gameplay makes it seem like the perfect game to play with a friend....\n\nWhat it means is, should you buy this game on Steam with plans for a co-op playthrough, your friend will either have to (somehow) share the keyboard with you OR (more likely) bring a console controller along to plug in.\n\nYes, that's right, after the fans of previous games clamouring for a better multiplayer option that could only have increased sales, the company have allowed this game to become little more than another trouble port, while not making it clear from the get-go that one of the game's main selling points is severely limited.\n\nUnless you are looking for that info specifically while researching the game-- and even then --you will likely not realise this suspiciously brushed-under-the-table piece of info and will likely purchase the game before realising the issue. A shame really, since all it serves to do is remind PC gamers that the game is JUST a port, and harms future sales of what can easily be a fun experience, as many gamers have and will continue to swear off any of the developer's future products.\n\nIn reality, it only shows how that last little bit of effort to really make the game great was either too much effort for the developer or something they saw as not worth investing in, for their customers. As I said, a shame for a product that otherwise could have been easily recommendable.","August 12, 2013","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
