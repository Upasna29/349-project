Anyway:\n\nOrder of War is a game of deloying units and taking flags - there is no base building.\n\nIt has some good features:\n\n*There is a certain level of tactical gameplay. This is pretty much simply decision-making about which reinforcements will be needed to counter your enemy's deployments.\n*The units have a solid WW2 feel if not a little aged in graphical quality.\n*There is a good variety of units with various infantry, motorised and armoured units to choose from. Adding to this there is a limited selection of air units available that can be countered by anti-air units.\n*There is satisfaction to be had from breaking through the enemy front line and advancing to the next objective (objective meaning 'flag' because the game is essentially 'capture the flag').\n\nOrder of War however also has some issues that in my opinion stop this 2/5 game being rated maybe a 3/5 or 4/5.\n\n*There is no Multiplayer any longer. By lack of Multiplayer I also mean no LAN either. This is a major show-stopper as the game seems almost geared towards Multiplayer than Single player. I can see the potential that Multiplayer would turn the routine flag stealing from a tactically-naive AI into an epic struggle of egos.\n* The campaign feels a bit routine and by the numbers. It is a fairly monotone experience of basically capturing and defending flags.\n*So with no Multiplayer at all and a join-the-dots campaign we need a good skirmish experience to compensate.\nThe Skirmish option allows some limited customisation but simply borrows campaign maps, uses them as a blank canvas and asks you to capture all the flags - a victory theme we are getting a little too used to in this game. And to limit things even further the developers offer you only a handful of maps.\n\nDon't get me wrong. If you like WW2 RTS games you will still have some fun with elements of this game, but it will only be a temporary distraction from games with more replayability.\n\nI would highly recommend the game if the developers simply:\n\nAdded more skirmish maps and make skirmish more customisable.\n& Re-implemented LAN and/or MP capability. Why, when developers shut down servers, do they not replace online Multiplay with LAN is beyond me.\n\nIt's thumbs down until they restore at least LAN to the game and add some more content. The game feels half-baked.","October 19, 2014","false","28.3"," 82 of 115 people (71%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","71","82","115","8","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/34600/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","With all my sincere respect for the developer of this WWII strategy game, Wargaming-dot-net studio, I'm having a hard time with actually recommending this game. At least there, on Steam, with its current unpatched state. You see, this game heavily suffers from the memory leakage bug, which ends up in crushing after every mission or even during the long ones (especially when they interrupted by videoclips). There is a cure, sure, but you have to look for it yourself, and it will not be a quick search. So I clearly understand some of the people, who wants to buy that game, but Not-On-Steam, considering the fact Steam is really, really Slow with updating non-mainstream games, even if it's obvious gems like Fallout 1&2, which was unplayable on Steam (with modern system) for several years!\n\nNow, when I said that, let's get on with an actual review. Order of War is an interesting approach on the field of modern strategies, when everyone knows one-two games, three at most. So, generally, no, it is not like the Company of Heroes, totally another scale, more like in the Total War... quite different in details, but close at feeling out of the game session.\nFor many people, Order of War is looking like World in Conflict... well, yeah, there are some common points, like lack of many core elements of "classic" strategies, like building units, push-pull struggle for resources and other "micromanagement" - all gone. You have some regiments under your command, and for successful operations, you'll be gaining some "points" to upgrade your troops (for better attack, defence etc.) Sometimes there will be small tasks like to conquer 2-3 AA-guns or bunkers, and 1-2 squads for you, and sometimes you'll be ordering full front assault for dozens of tanks, managing large scale army successes. And all that according to history books: paratroopers landing and storming the coasts in Northern France, stalemate at Bulge, and all other noticable operations - all there. I've seen some whinings from people who trying to play for Nazies, like "upgrades costs too much, there are less reinforcements and resources for Germans, that's not fair!" Oh, yeah, it's fair. Here's a short morale lesson: it is always easier on Bad side at first, and miles-harder at finish. And in the year 1944  it was almost the end end of Nazi conquest, their numbers were greatly diminished at East, their productions were at pieces thanks to Allies bombardments... no doubt it is Hard to play for Germans at 1944! Well, think of it as of challenge: a hardest level of it. Save every soldier possible, maneuver like Mars himself, and fight like Leonidas to secure the borders of Vaterland... and postpone the unevitable.\n\nOther than disbalance between sides (which Was really nerfed in skirmishes, BTW), the only real blame I've seen from people about Order of War is that by terms of gameplay you just gotta send your troops straight on frontal assault, every time. That remark shows really how far those critics moved into the game... as that tactic works in first mission, and partly in second. They are kind of tutorial, see - so the player get the flow, such as effective distance of fire, grenade throws, effectiveness and weak points of artilliry and tanks... First mission is forgiving the errors, but if you can't catch the drift, you'll be lost very quickly (maybe the easy setting is different, but who's playing strategies on easy?)\n\nOkay, in the end, I recommend Order of War to all people who have any interest in real-time strategies. There are not enough of them now, as you know... This game provides real battlefields of WWII, with realistic maps of battlefields and ability to resize the view from very close one, where you notice projectiles flying over the ground, to the mile-high-observation post, to see the whole town at once - and your units sieging it from all sides, for example. Also, there are quite enough background info to sink in, as usual in the games from Wargaming, so think of it as of history discourse of sort. The level of challenge is raising from mission to mission, so, even when you see all the map from the start of mission, that certainly doesn't mean you see all on it. That means the game is not simple as it seems at start, when you don't notice "fog of war" and shouldn't count the reinforcements. It's all comes later, when you presumably learned the basics.\n\nThe only real downside is that that game has no particular reason to buy it through Steam. If you'll find another source, where you'll be knowing that memory leak problem is already taken care of - maybe it would be better choise to get it there.\nMark 7.2/10.","May 10","true","129.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","1"

It's basically as another reviewer said Company of Heroes but a big scale (for example your tank units come with 5 in each section) so you feel like a real General rather than a company commander. It's also in my opinion more realistic in some ways - infantry get slaughtered, tanks get knocked out pretty quickly vs the right defences like anti tank guns or tank destroyers and artillery really does play havoc when it lands accurately. You can play as either the Americans invading Normandy or the Germans fighting on the Eastern front in the campaign. In Skirmish mode you can play as America, Germany and the USSR (Russia) which gives nice unit look variety.\n\nHowever there is still a lot to be desired - the gameplay does become easily boring as it's pretty much the same. You call in reinforcements using credits you earn from capture points (no base building) and can win every map just by dominating in artillery if you plan it right. In some maps I only needed one tank unit and the rest was anti tank guns and artillery destroying everything that moved. Units like infantry are basically obsolete and they will be wiped out the second anything fires so it doesn't allow many tactics apart from tank rushing in my opinion. The units are pretty much identical however for all nations - I've not noticed any special tactics or way of playing myself.\n\nOverall if it's on sale (around half the asking price now) it is certainly worth a buy and you'll get a good few hours out of it.\n\nI also have read that the multiplayer has gone offline - while this doesn't bother me personally that would be a downside for most. The option still is in the menu though so I'm not sure what is going on with that.","September 21, 2015","true","23.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Happily I were mistaken. The way Order of War handles some features is unique. I like the unit size and conflict size which is completely new thing to me when it comes to world war II strategy games. It reminds me of tabletop miniature games like Warhammer 40k, or Flames of War, where whole unit of tanks or vehicles is controlled.\n\nOn the other side there are some things lacking on physics and the game system. Vehicles and infantry could cooperate bit more. Another thing I would like to see is mechanized infantry using halftracks and stuff like that. Also the role of normal infantry is a bit lacking, as Infantry automatically starts crawling as they approach the enemy.\n\nWhen it comes to my final opinion... I like this game. There are definitely ways to improve it, but I give it a good mark.","January 27","true","6.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

At the same time, if you look at the game as what it's intended to be, it's still just about average.\n\nFirst, the campaign is dull and frustrating, and no RTS that was ever made should have ever been purchased to even try the campaign - these games are all like AAA fps games, Battlefield and Call of Duty, which are usually bought souly to just play the multiplayer side of things, or in an RTS game's case, the skirmish.  The campaign lacks any excitement because it's an RTS game.   Reviews based on anything to do with the campaign at all are pretty much a waste of time.  We don't give Battlefield bad reviews for bad glitchy campaigns, we give it great reviews for the multiplayer.  Same thing.\n\nSo we look at what deserves attention - the skirmish.  Order of War is what Total War would've been if it had been based in WWII.  There is no base construction and the maps are very large and open, always cutting teams in half so that you never spawn next to them.  Units have no abilities, and there are only three factions.  To choose a faction, you must play in multiplayer online, or stage a LAN game - as the skirmish mode limits you to senarios.  Both provide bots.  You can play as USA, Russia, or Germany, but all are almost exactly similiar, enough to not totally matter.\n\nYou purchase units based on they're effectiveness versus their cost kinda system. In other games, a better player will overcome a tank if fighting the same tank used by a bad player.  This isn't the case in Order of War.  You buy the bad tank, the good tank, or the best tank.  The bad infantry, the good infantry, or the best infantry.  It's not as strict as it sounds, fast firing shorter range mortars aren't camparable to long range slow shooting artillery guns, and you can get a few differing units like anti tank infantry or mobile artillery vehicles, but you understand.  The store page mentions and shows off planes and junk, but these aren't actual units, only off map abilities and strikes.\n\nUnits move slow, and AT pieces, artillery guns and infantry must be consiously transported via truck by the player, otherwise they'll jog about to destinations at a mind numbingly ineffective, slow pace.  These normal movements are more to change facings or to slowly advance, or to hide behind the OTHER side of a building if you take hits, and not to go attack an area, meaning so long as it's not a tank, you cannot shoot and move at the same time.\n\nFor all of these reasons, classic RTS strategy doesn't really apply to Order of War - the outcome of all battles are largely predictable because the units are either bad, good, or the best you can buy.  This is probably the largest reason Order of War ever gets bashed.  The strategy is missed because it's not the same as other RTS games, and people burn it down for not having the things it wasn't intended to have in the first place.  It's like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on Call of Duty for not having Creepers and no resource collecting.  What?\n\nThe game doesn't play like Company of Heroes or Men of War, and the strategy is completely focused on timing and movement.  These are important in all RTS games, but in this game, it's the ONLY element to focus on.  You buy cheaper units to occupy the space, and to distract, as there are no real indicators as to units taking damage.  The maps are big and you have to keep your eyes on everything.  The fun is completely based on troop movement, and being at the right place at exactly the right time.  Infantry can't truck up to AT guns and take them out, they'll get blown away, so intercept them while the AT getting trucked themselves and have them set up just as you dismount infantry next to them.  Things like that.  If your enemy has bought nothing but the best tanks, they've got no resources and you can go ahead and buy some extremely cheap AT guns without the worry of taking an airstrike, and get a bunch of cheap tanks to rush the map once your AT has killed all of those scary bad tanks.  There is no fog of war in this game, and once you realise it's about watching the other guys and moving your ♥♥♥♥ around instead of building strongpoints or bases or using some kind of grenade ability or something, then you'll realise what a fun fast paced game it really is.  It's about moving around AT and artillery and tanks and infantry more than just sending ♥♥♥♥ off to fight, seeing as you'll already know which battles you'll win or lose.  If you play it right, you won't lose a unit, and eat the other guys, and that's where the fun is <.<\n\nAt the same time, compared to just how addictive the gameplay is, it's not, the maps all look the same and so does the combat, unlike Men of War which has too much micro to ever have similiar firefights, or Company of Heroes which is too cinamatic to ever be boring.  Knowing what kind of RTS Order of War is, it's great, but as a game in generally - and as you can see by my play time - it's >.> okayyyyyyyyyyyyy lol\n\nCan you spam? Yes.  Can you attack head on? Yes.  Should you ever do any of these? Never.  It's a game that's enjoyed only if you know how to play it :/ which at the same time, makes it slightly less user friendly.  It doesn't look like there would be a large learning curve, but there is.  If you just want to see mindless destruction, you can easily play the game the WRONG way too <.< which is what most bad reviewers have done.","October 2, 2014","true","3.8"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","4"

Still, besides that fact this game is super fun, with a good resource/reinforcement system.

So far I've racked up 45 hours of gameplay. The history and set up is good for the campign is very good. The game play itself is very engrossing and it gives a fresh point capture rts that unlocks units and allows you to gather resources instead of building a static base then building you're army. The action is none stop you might think your about to win then the enemy just kicks you in the teeth out of nowhere its rather fun and keeps it interesting. I give this game 5 ot of 5 for price, gameplay, and general replayability. Hope you find my review helpful. Sincerely Lust.","April 26, 2012","true","66.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
