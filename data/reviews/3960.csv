My mistake.\n\nHere's how you do it:\n\n1. In your Start Menu search field, type in "msconfig", without the " " of course.\n\n2. Click on the Boot tab.\n\n3. Click on the Advance Options button.\n\n4. Check the little box next to "Maximum memory" and set the max to 2048.\n\n5. Reboot computer.\n\nNow when it reboots, Windows will act and run as if there is only 2GB of memory installed. This will allow Shattered Union to run. After you're done playing, go back to msconfig and uncheck the Maximum Memory box and then reboot, to allow Windows full use of all your RAM.\n\nAgain, sorry for the lack of detail earlier. I really do need to stop posting after I get home from work, but before I've had dinner...","February 13, 2014","true","0.6"," 50 of 59 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","50","59","0","3"

This one isn't really breaking any molds or moving the genre forward, but it's rock solid. Shattered Union has a very niche market and never really sold well for the original Xbox, but interest in the Steam sale may have prompted a brief revival. In all fairness, that's probably a good thing.\n\nShattered Union is an entry-level strategy game that just about anyone can pick up. It's probably not a game most people would put a lot of time into, but it's at the very least worth owning.","March 19, 2011","true",""," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","5"

Instead I got a clunky menu, unbalanced maps, gameplay that is beyond stiff, an annoying camera, and the same old generic  CoD story about Russia being behind all this and regressing back to the Soviet days. The factions all feel the same and there really isn't much substance as far as engaging gameplay, just build more and bigger tanks than everyone else and try your hardest to steamroll people. Terrain really isn't a factor in most battles and a smaller, more agile army can almost never outwit a larger, high-firepower one, brute force is ALL that matters, very little real tactics.
