It has potetial and if it is fixed it could make an ok game, especially for younger ages.  But at the current (12th of July 2015) state, ehh, yeah...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLfP1QDTJ2Y","July 12, 2015","false","0.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

I like the animations and the control is well explained in the help section.  The characters are cute and I like how they all have their own powers and have to work together to get to the next level. The game is easy to play and it is fun to find solutions to overcome the obstacles.\n","July 17, 2015","true","3.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","0"
