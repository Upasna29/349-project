I will say NO, because the other review is similar, but recommends this.  This way, the over-all reviews balance out.\n\nIt feels VERY alpha, much like a senior project in computer programming. UPDATE: Some mix-up had me download a development build (linux version), it has since been updated and is much more polished than the first download.  I love the broadside action, but that's about it.  The rest is mindless wandering around, shooting stuff.  I was only able to get the grappling done once, and did a boarding - I thought it was a joke at first, my guy was dancing / fighting with no one around, as I moved. Boarding combat is much better, but still on the "cheesy" side.  Then the opposing "crew" came at me (like 4 on 1 or something).  Killed the crew, finished off the captain in a most unremarkable way and got the larger treasure galleon!  (which meant my ship sinks?)\n\nAnyway, it is not something I would put serious money towards, but for $3.74 I did not feel too cheated.  $1.99 or $0.99 would be more realistic, and have EARLY ACCESS or ALPHA plastered all over, so people are warned!  The game does feel more finished, albeit lacking depth (again, for under $5, what do we expect?)","September 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","18","23","2","3"

The controls are clunky, the graphics are ugly, and the objective is simply to sail around and blow ♥♥♥♥ up for no ryhme or reason.  There are no ports that you can land at, you have no crew, and you will be overwhelmed eventually.\n\nOverall if the pricepoint were any higher I would say stay far away from this game, but at 3-5 dollars you get your moneys worth if you play 2 games.  Its entertaining enough to justify that, just dont expect a masterpiece... Or even a particularly good piece... This is the gaming equivalent of the cheap minibooks that are in line at a bookstore.  However its probably more fun than a coffee from starbucks.","September 18, 2015","true","2.3"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","0"

Sadly I'm disappointed by simplistic gameplay and pretty much no reason to play.\n\npros:\nGood help pages explaining game mechanics\nships and pirates?\ncons:\nthere is no reason to kill anything. You get no loot, no fleet. Can trade ship and get some infamy so that bigger ships are after u, that is it.\nno ammo types. Grappling hooks are very weird - they don't shoot straight, but wiggle around as if I was throwing toilet paper.\nsails can be only on/off, instead of different grades. I guess rowing helps, but makes no sense.\nno wather effects, so that you could - for example - utilize sail grades in storm\ncrew combat is very boring. It is you against 3-10 enemy crew members. All you need to do is stand next to "board" spot for enemy to come one by one and just spam them with left clicks. Also it is sometimes unresponsive.\nno ports where you can trade, recruit and do some management stuff (there is nothing to manage)\nI really don't recommend this game, use your time better.","October 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Only 3 maps to play so not much exploration. You can unlock a variety of different ships with different stats. You can board other ships and steal them when yours is low on health or if you just want a better ship. There are also statues around the map that you can shoot to get upgrades that transfer to any ship you are using at the time. They are only good per play session though.\n\nThe little time I played I did have some fun but I've had my fill. Worth checking out if you like some pirate ship battles.","December 13, 2015","true","5.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

ARRRRRRRH (splendid).\nEvery single ship feels and sails differently, has its own advantages and disadvantages.\nBecause of that, even after 5 hours and many encounters, every new combat is still fun and enthralling.\n\nI wish one could combine S.M.'s Pirates with that combat mechanic, or port royal.\n\n(5 hours of fun for only 5€ makes it recommandable)","September 24, 2015","true","5.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"
