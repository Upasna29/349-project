"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/362660/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","I wanted to like Blue Rose, but there are too many issues with the novel that hold it back from what could have been a great story.  While there is plenty of potential here, the unpolished writing, underdeveloped characters and lifeless world prevent the story from leaving any emotional impact on the reader. These deficiencies are then hidden beneath a somewhat polished veneer.\n\nOur story begins with Lena, a Templar of the Blue Rose, escorting a diplomatic envoy when her party is attacked by a raging dragon.  Knocked unconscious in battle, she wakes to find herself under the care of a young hunter in an area of the forest that by all knowledge should be uninhabited.  Discovery of a secret village nestled in the mountains leads her to question all that she has known as war threatens the peace of this idyllic refuge.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=429813100\nDespite an intriguing setup, the story never goes anywhere interesting.  Dragons, magic, war and politics, all ideas ripe with creative storytelling, yet they linger impotently as our protagonist wanders from place to place with no direction.  By the time the villain is revealed and the story finally grabs hold, I had long lost interest in the world and its inhabitants.  Insufficient world building only adds to the problem.  Those little details that hint at something more, small ideas that create history and give depth, are either conspicuously absent or quickly brushed over so as to never allow them a chance to fully realize.  The resulting image is a rough sketch rather than a colorful portrait.\n\nWell written characters can absolutely prop up a weak story and carry interest to the end, even if it's only to witness how their personal plot lines resolve.  Sadly, not one of Blue Rose's characters are interesting enough to carry the narrative.  Each of the guys (and girl) play to his respective trope, but never grow beyond that.  The story does nothing to challenge who these people are nor give them a means to develop; what you see is what you get. What we learn of their histories and motivations changes little of how I view them in the end.\n\nAnd there's our heroine, Lena, a blindly devoted Templar of the Blue Rose whose only character flaw is an unquestioning dedication to her kingdom's cause.  Why this is viewed as a bad thing we'll never know, the only justification given is "war is bad." Perhaps if we were privy to the corruption that she was too blind to see, it might be understandable.  Beyond that, I question what makes her so appealing that everyone falls for her. Is it the fact that she's one of the few female Templars, or that she carries a sword and can fight?  It's certainly not her limitless empathy, overwhelming kindness or keen intellect, as she's never given an opportunity to sufficiently exhibit these traits let alone prove herself more than the dutiful soldier that she is.  Every romance, save possibly Simon, makes little sense given her disposition.\n\nCompounding the character and plot issues is the unpolished writing style.  Wordiness.  The developer needs to look up the term, because I don't think he understands how exhausting it is to read through wordy writing.  When your reader stumbles over sentences because the word flow is encumbered by needless description, you have an issue with wordiness.  When you can cut out 90% of the instances of "just," "still," "really," "even," and practically all tenses of "to be", and the action still makes sense, you have a problem with wordiness.  This is all despite hiring an editor to clean up the script prior to hitting Steam.  I tried my hardest to drudge through the writing, and while it reads slightly better than before, it's still too much of a chore.  I am constantly correcting not only wordiness, but awkward sentence structure, conflicting verb tense, and the many glaring typos spread throughout.  All I want is to experience the story, but the words keep getting in the way.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=442051165\nThat said, the remainder of the presentation is fairly polished.  Although the artwork isn't incredible, it's pleasant enough with some nicely drawn CGs and character sprites.  I also quite enjoyed the background images, especially the forested areas with their lonely, tranquil feel.  The orchestral soundtrack is a highlight which features enchanting themes that give off an air of fantasy and adventure.  But as much as Blue Rose looks and sounds pretty, it's not enough to make up for major problems in the writing.\n\nI want to support indie developers, especially visual novel writers, because this is a genre that is sorely underappreciated, but I cannot in good conscience promote a game that has so many problems simply because I want to see a developer succeed.  It boggles my mind how many reviewers champion Blue Rose as one of the better OELVN's when these issues greatly hinder the potential it has.  If you absolutely must own it, wait for a sale or bundle, $20 is way too expensive for the quality of storytelling we are given.\n\nBottom Line: Not recommended.","May 13, 2015","false","9.1"," 143 of 153 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","143","153","2","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekanji/recommended/362660/","tekanji","Miss Andri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tekanji/","186 products in account","Summary: 4/10This game can be summed up in one word: Mediocre. If you like dating VNs and/or fantasy stories, get this game when it's on deep sale or included in a bundle. (I got it as a present from a friend.)\n\nDetailed Review:I am, admittedly, a harsh critic when it comes to VNs because I have high expectations and prefer games with good gameplay elements. In terms of gameplay, Blue Rose has potential but unfortunately the choices are uninteresting because most of them aren't meaningful and the map system is a bit too linear.\n\nThe story also falls short; I agree with other reviewers that the premise set up is interesting, and some of the tidbits about the world are interesting, but the worldbuilding was half-baked at best and would occasionally break my immersion (Simon assuming that the village chief was a man was one instance; in a world where women seem to have equal opportunities, why would he assume the leader must be male?). I did enjoy the branching story (each character had a unique good and bad ending), but the repeat text in a diverging branch (ie. when the same scene is reached from a different path) was unskippable, so I found myself clicking to get through it and hoping I wasn't missing any flavor text. Tighter prose could have helped alleviate the tedium, but I would have prefered that they had programmed the game properly so that it would skip repeat text (honestly, did they copy the same scene over and over because they couldn't figure out how to either use jumps and variables to control the differing text? I don't know.)\n\nThe art and animation are the most polished parts of the game by far. While some of the backgrounds were obviously 3D renders, they fit in surprisingly well with the rest of the game's backgrounds. I thought the character art was pretty, but I was bothered by the extremely narrow bodies. The white-ish hair of the three male characters also made it extremely hard to tell them apart on the map. It was so bad that my friend and I joked that someone on the dev team had a Sepiroth fetish. The game also utilized Ren'py's animation capabilities to its fullest; I was quite impressed with the art direction in many of the scenes.\n\nThe great art is why the horrible UI baffles me so much. They barely customized the dialog box; keeping the horrible Ren'py bold for the label and adding a background gradient without bothering to adjust the height of the text, so the first line overlaps with the gradient and makes it hard to read. The Gallery was also very basic, rows of CGs split into pages instead of the more typical character-based gallery pages. I feel like the devs underestimated how important a good UI is for player experience.\n\nOverall, the game was entertaining enough for me to play through in its entirety. I didn't find it fun enough to justify the almost $20 price tag, but I'd say it is probably good enough for VN fans to pick up on a 50% or more sale.\n\nAs an aside, Steam's crappy forced "recommend"/"not recommend" system was almost enough to make me not write this review, since I don't feel comfortable recommending it but I feel less comfortable not recommending it (given that I played through all the content of the game). If they want to force a quantitative review that they can stick up on the page, why the heck won't they give us a more nuanced rating system?!?! Sigh.","September 10, 2015","true","7.5"," 31 of 32 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","31","32","2","1"

I really enjoyed it when I originally bought it, and since replying it now on Steam enjoyed it just as much. It's purely story based so no stat building, which I liked. It doesn't try to trick you so you can usually aim for an ending and get it without use of a walkthrough.\n\nStory: The story is well developed and thought out. It focuses more on decisions and their consequences than solely on romance, which is something I loved about it. I appreciate when the overall story is just as important as whichever character you are pursuing. The romance is certainly there, but if you're looking for a lot of pure romantic scenes you're not going to find them here. There are very few CGs of even kisses. Ultimately it feels more realistic. There's a lot the characters have to deal with, both plot-wise and personal, and Lena only interacts with the characters over the course of two weeks. The relationships are slowly built but solid and feel real because of it.\n\nCharacters: They're all very well developed with their own personalities and opinions that they stick to. It's stated in the VN itself that everyone has their own reasons for being in the town, and there's certainly more to all of them than the impression you get when you first meet them. They grow over the course of the two weeks, especially Lena herself. Lena makes an excellent main character because she's strong but isn't overpowered. At times she still must rely on other characters, but other times she's completely capable of relying on herself.\n\nIt made me laugh. It made me go back and reread scenes. I'd certainly recommend it.","April 30, 2015","true","5.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","2"

There aren't enough pure fantasy otome games! It has a good frame for a good story, but lacks enough content for a full price purchase. I bought it at a 50% discount and think that is a reasonable price.\n\n+ The music is fitting and pleasant to listen to. The BGM changed frequently between tracks to suit the situation. There is also a BGM player in the Gallery which is a bonus for me.\n+ Unlockable short prequel stories that added much need depth\n+ A strong intro with a strong willed protagonist. The demo covers this and left me intrigued enough to purchase the game afterwards.\n+/- The art is good for the most part. The colors and character designs are suitable to it's fantasy theme and the shading is very good. The flaw lies in the character anatomy. Sometimes the CGs looks decent, other times you can tell when the proportions are off. There is actually a mod that fixes a few character sprites, but I did not find this out until after I was done with the game.\n- Romance feels lacking and unbalanced between routes. There are kiss scenes in 2 routes while the others end platonically as far as I can tell. Not enough chemistry is shown for the relationships to progress naturally.\n- The routes fall on the short side. The pacing of the story goes by quick. To me, it felt like a 12 episode anime that got crammed into a 2 hour movie. I would have liked more explanations about backstory or world lore. In fact, there are quite a few things that are left unexplained. Game time takes place over 15 or so days.\n- I did not feel attached to any character. The extra stories added what I felt was lacking in the main game and wished there were more mini-scenes peppered between the days.\n- Linear choices. Every choice is A or B. Each character has a good and bad ending. There are little to no variations. I found myself skipping most of the common parts in later routes.\n\nPersonally, the parts with the non-humans were the best. If this game is on sale or in a bundle and you generally like fantasy themed stories, then go for it.","January 6","false","15.1"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","20","21","0","1"

It has sweet scenes, but is set over 14 days, so be aware that only so much can happen, as opposed to the years of Hakuoki or months of Dandelion. The protagonist isn't that "easy" and I think they do a good job making her a capable, kick-butt fighter while still having her oblivious edge that lets an Otome game spin out the romantic fluff a little more.\n\nThere's no stat building, just the "choose your own adventure" options that open different dialogue and opportunities down the road.\n\nI also haven't run into any of the off-the-wall sexual inuendo that can pop up in some of these games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/recommended/362660/","keohookalani","keohookalani","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keohookalani/","2712 products in account","Blue Rose is a Visual Novel set in a fantasy world, where two factions are fighting for domination in a war. Caught up in the middle are ordinary citizens who are trying to make a new life for themselves. Enter the protagonist, Lena, a Templar of the Blue Rose whose actions have implications on the lives of the villagers whether she likes it or not.\n\nI found Blue Rose to be the best VN I have played to date. I am quite aware there are many other VNs out there and many are better than Blue Rose, but for me, this is the one that takes the cake. Admittedly I haven't played as many as other people who review VNs, but that's also because I typically don't like VNs very much. I'm just not a fan of the genre. But this one had me stuck to my computer for several hours reading through the various plot lines.\n\nSound: The background music was okay. I had no issues with it, nor was I impressed with it.\n\nGraphics: For what seems like an independent group of developers putting this together, I was rather pleased with the attention to detail. Sure, it's not the greatest art in the VN world, but it's definitely above some strange titles like High School Romance or Last Days of Spring.\n\nControls: I never though I'd need to write about controls in a VN, till I played Last Days of Spring which gives you next to no ability to customize the experience. Blue Rose offers controller support, text skipping both new and previously read messages, auto play, and more. Definitely has what's necessary to make VN'ing a pleasurable experience.\n\nStory: This is truly where Blue Rose shines. While there are the edgings of some standard tropes among the characters, there are also unique characters that are interesting to find out about. Some VNs have this annoying habit of allowing you to 'make' choices but really all you end up with that is different is perhaps 30 lines of story, and a different ending with a different person at the end. As you explore the universe that Blue Rose is set in, you'll discover more about the characters than you thought you would as you explore the different paths. Their motivations become clearer as you explore the different story arcs. As you progress down those different paths, you'll find a very different story plays out each time, though the first main two might be a little similar. But don't skip the bad endings, aside from being part of the achievements, they also fill in gaps and show very interesting aspects of characters when provoked.\n\nOverall: 7.2/10 - I don't even like VNs but this happens to be a very good one. I'm sure people can recommend better, but for me, I was impressed with it. It very much reminded me of the old Choose your own Adventure books where the story actually changed instead of just changing a love interest. VNs tend to run higher in cost, so I can't evaluate price fairly, but I probably wouldn't spend $20 myself. But again, I'm not a fan of the genre. Take that for what it's worth.","May 29","true","8.8"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

This was some time ago, I write this review from memory. The played time corresponds to that of idling the game for cards.\n\nIntroductionThis is a Visual Novel: a kind of interactive story where the player takes some decisions for the main character in key points of the story, building the story through its end, which depends on the decisions taken. There are no other playable elements in the game. VNs often have romanceable characters (this game has a few male and a female) and adult/erotic content (this game has none of it). Sometimes VNs have some simulation elements or other minigames (this has none).\n\nStory and backgroundThe player takes the role of a female young knight in a fantasy world. During a escort mission, travelling through an isolated frontier region with other knights, they are attacked by a dragon and she gets separated of the group. She awakes injured in a rogue settlement, while she tries to recover, found out about her missing companions and decide what to do in the end.\n\nReviewAs for visual novels go, this is one of my favourite, and I've played many, AAA and indie, old and new.\nApart from the setting being different from the overused slice of life, or clumsy teen founding harem themes, the world they live in is consistent, the writing is solid (at least more than the average, let me clear that since this seems to be a common issue for other reviewers), there aren't mayor avoidable-through-proof-reading errors, and the character actions and decisions don't feel forced, hasty, idiotic or unnatural. Too very often I feel embarrased for the actions of the characters I play, or the reactions from the secondary characters. This game was not the case. Both the main and secondary characters were mostly deep, relatable and likable in different grades that depend on the player (and limited by the extension of the game). For me, playing this female character was enjoyable. I'd define her as a strong, courageos woman unused to act outside of the role of a champion of her faith, but not so much as to fall in tomboy or social failure archetypes.\nFor the art, you should judge yourself from the featured screenshots and video. Character art is anime style, and in spite of questionable anatomic features (a bit too over-stylized, some weird necks, but -thank god- plausible busts, too much ash hair but fortunately no other fancy animeish colors) and lack of detail (characters look unquestionably good, and that's the problem: they all look in their twenties), they are expressive, of enough quality, and finally fit the serious tone of the story.\nI find the length of the game in my range of comfort, which means that other players may feel it a bit short. The game may lack a bit in content. Some endings may be a bit too similar, but others are pretty interesting. I'd add that this is one of the only games a played without skipping already read parts in a second playthrough.\n\nVeredictI'm glad and proud to recommend this game.\nThe main reason for that is "I enjoyed the game": good setting and story, relatable and likable main character and appropiate length.\n","February 28","true","1.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Being a fan of visual novels, I think I have a pretty good sense of which ones are good versus which ones should be passed over.\n\nNow this game has gotten mixed reviews since it has been released on Steam and I can see why.  I'll give this a positive rating since I liked the game more although I did find flaws in it.  But on to the review.  XD\n\nThe story-I liked the overall idea of what Blue Rose was trying to convey in that in a war, it's not always easy to choose one side or the other.  Sometimes, there are gray areas and people choose the path that others do not expect them to.  However, I think this idea could have been better fleshed out.  Without giving away major spoilers, I think that if the romanceable option that Lena, the playable character, pursues were to explain his/her reasons for not wanting to be involved in the war that the game creates, then that would make things clearer.  This does get explained when the paths are split but the paths are split after a supposed major conflict is over.  However, in my opinion, I think the explanation would have been better placed before that major event happens.\n\nNow on to the paths, there were some that I liked more than others.  My favorite path would definitely be Aran's and I feel like his path is a true path.  It explains why certain events happened in the game and all and how the conflicts can be resolved and does so without it feeling dragged out.  My second favorite path would have to be Gavin's but that's because I liked what happens near the end of his good path.  I won't say more since that would reveal major spoilers.  XD  My least favorite would probably be Erin's because I feel that the events aren't as action-filled and that her path feels dragged out.\n\nI liked the art and the CGs and the music was pretty good so no complaints there.  The only other complaint I'd have to make (and I'm sure that this has been brought up by others) is that there were quite a lot of typos and grammar errors.  I don't know if this game was proofread (it probably was) and I know how difficult it can be finding all of the errors but there were quite a lot and I think this game could use some additional polishing in that respect.  It would make reading the text smoother.  I would suggest some editing of the content as well but at the very least, one additional run at proofreading should be made so that it looks as professional as can be.\n\nOverall, I think Blue Rose has the potential to be a good game and that's why my rating will be positive despite the criticism I just gave.  I hope that the developer will take my opinion into account, as I look forward to any future games.  ^^","July 12, 2015","true","32.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Writing is decent, nothing terrible or offensively stupid like in a lot of VNs but nothing too unique or interesting. Nice music. Five characters to have an ending with, each with a good and bad ending. Mediocre art. Few choices. Very short so not much time is spent on the world/people. Without the writing having anything particularly good about it and without the hilariously stupid moment present in a lot of VN it doesn't leave much of an impression as being either good or bad in either an entertaining or memorable way.

From what I've seen the writing isn't great.\nThe protagonist, Lena, is cringe worthy and plain annoying/stupid in the first half. It is a wonder how she can be a "templar". Most other characters aren't too far off either. It gets slightly better later on, but it is still real work to get through.\nThis also poses a problem for the story's convincingness because the build-up, and Lena's transition from a mindless "templar" to a small hero who finds love etc feels abrupt and forced. Honestly, the part I've seen is pretty dull.\nAnyways, I am compelled to leave this game's story unfinished in my head because I cannot find the strength to go through it again.","March 29","false","8.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/362660/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Blue Rose is a visual novel about a knight, Lena, that ends up in a remote village. Depending on her choices, you will end up romantically with one of the characters - though it will also influence revelations about the story or not.\n\nIn itself, the plot is very interesting as Lena is confronted to stay true to her oath or to dismiss it when the enemy isn't really one. She's also hard on herself but she needs also to learn to appreciate her skills. Each character is also having a good background: Simon, her captain, seems to get on her nerves because of her crush if you want to follow Simon's path, Tobias is showing sympathy and coldness each time to her, as he's crushing on her but also very focused on protecting everything around, Gavin is quite the seductive and funny guy but with a secret that could kill him, Aran is very mysterious and very curious about human relationships as he's not used to that form and Erin is very cheerful and very happy to see Lena, but she also seems to be sad sometimes.\n\nHowever, it doesn't mean that you have only one bad ending and the rest is romance. Indeed, each character has a bad and a good ending. It's also interesting to experience them fully as it's a matter of life or death. It also means to save often as the choices are also including who you're going to see when you're on the map.\n\nThe graphics are good, I loved the art style and the soundtrack was very fitting.\n\nEverything was reunited for a good length of pleasure. However, Blue Rose fails. A single element killed the fun.\n\nToo much dialogues and not enough choices to make a break. You click, you click, you click, you choose an option, you click, you click, you click, you click. In the end, you're loosing interest in the plot because there are too much information at once.\n\nYou'll ask why I'm descending it in flames as there is another visual novel which is more an interactive book than a game (Shan Gui). In Shan Gui, you don't have many routes to think and you can learn something from it thanks to the links to Wikipedia. It's the goal of the game in reality. In Blue Rose, you're here to really take Lena to her destiny and the only thing you really do is to read many dialogues before finally getting some action with the choice.\n\nYou can't skip dialogues the first time they're appearing, which is normal but you wish you can. I was bored and if I did complete the game, it's because I was interested to see each route and to have a 100% in achievements.\n\nBlue Rose could have been a very good visual novel if the gameplay was more balanced. Every condition was reunited for a good moment and the length of the dialogues killed the fun for me. I would recommend to avoid it if you're easily bored. There are better visual novels out there, like Hatoful Boyfriend for example.","August 22, 2015","false","4.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Overall the story had potential and I admit some curiosity as to the other paths and endings. Unfortunately I didn’t find the characters overly likable, and points of the story definitely dragged on.

That could have been handled more fluidly. You need more branches on your flowchart, if that makes sense.\n\nIt's a pretty solid VN.

It has a lot of defects - and I'll talk about some below - but it's still an average Visual Novel. There's a lot of crap Visual Novels out there made only for the sake of the fanservice and they have tons of positive reviews. That seems pretty unfair to me.\n\nThe game is kind of short, so it might be a good game to get in a bundle or a good sale. I've seen it in bundles pretty cheap a lot of times. It can be classified more as an Otome Game than as Fantasy Visual Novel, because only a few after the game starts, the main plot is a bit shoved aside to focus more and more in the romantic relation between the characters. Or I should say between Lena and the one you'll pursue as her love affair in game. Also, many people related that they couldn't get attached to any of the characters even with the lots of interaction between them. And yeah... some characters are pretty standart and cliché at all, in my opinion. So it's easy to feel nothing for them.\n\nAnother boring thing is that the "replayability" of the game sucks: most of the game parts will be pretty much the same if you decide to start a new route after completing your first one.\n\nThe art style is decent. It’s not amazing, but it has a certain charm. BG was ok, BGM was fine too. That being said, Blue Rose is a nice Visual Novel overall and you can have fun with it.","April 20","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
