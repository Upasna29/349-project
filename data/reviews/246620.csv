Just exactly how the player chooses to tackle this is up to them.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe player can choose to slowly infect the population, remaining undetected and non-lethal, and then strike once much of the world's population is infected by evolving lethality to kill fast and unexpectedly, making it difficult for the world to react and cure it in time or just try to kill the world as fast as possible which usually results in losing the game as many of the more isolated countries such as Greenland will shut their ports and airports making it very difficult to infect them.\n\nContent\n\nThe player is not presented with just one disease type, but many. These disease types range from a neurax worm which allows the player to manipulate infected hosts to their advantage to the necroa virus which allows the player to unleash a devastating zombie apocalypse on the world. It doesn't stop here though as there is a rather extensive community workshop with countless unique diseases thanks to the scenario creator which is available to every player who owns the game.\n\nMore coming\n\nThe developers of this game are also working on a multiplayer mode which will see two players battle it out to see who's plague is superior. The game is also regularly updated with new content and bug fixes.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile Plague Inc is not perfect, it offers great replayability with different ways to beat different scenarios and higher difficulty modes which can really challenge the player. The price is rather steep so I would suggest waiting until the game is on sale to get the best value for money. 8/10 - Great game","November 8, 2015","true","78.9"," 271 of 279 people (97%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","97","271","279","14","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/246620/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlague Inc.: Evolved; let me first start out by saying, this is exactly how the Early Access model should be done. This game is an absolute treat to play.\n\nThe main idea behind the game, if you don't already know (I’d be surprised if you didn't to be honest), is to develop, mutated and transmit your very own disease. You can choose which symptoms you would like your diseases to have, how you would like it to be transmitted around the world and many other different options. There are a number of different kinds of diseases you can choose, my favourite has to be the zombie plague; each of the different modes offers different symptoms, abilities and ways to transmit your creation as well.\n\nThe graphics are essentially a 2D world map; you don't need anything else for this game, the UI and HUD are very nicely put together and you can get all of the information you require within a key press.\n\nEach of the different modes have been carefully crafted so that no game ever feels the same; this game really makes you think, would this symptom thrive in these conditions? How can I get my plague to travel to the other side of the world when all of the airports are closed? The possibilities are endless.\n\nThe game can also vary in difficulty; each different mode has 4 stages of difficulty; and boy oh boy does it get hard in the brutal stages. You are best of cracking out a guide if you want to tackle some of the harder stages.\n\nI have played about ten hours so far; this has enabled me to complete all the different types of diseases and modes on offer, done a couple on Brutal difficulty and worked on a few achievements. There are still roughly 100 more achievements to collect along with the scenario modes to play; and given that they game is still in early access, I fully expect there to be more content added soon too.\n\nI can 100% guarantee that anyone will enjoy this game; it’s a perfect pick up and play game but you can also get mind numbingly deep into the inner workings of diseases and plagues without having to do six years in medical school.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

There are still missing features, most notably the Necroa Virus type, Tutorials & Scenarios. But allready the game is highly playable and damn addicting.\n\nYou are a plague, you infect people and evolve and the aim is to infect and kill everyone on earth in the end. There is strategy involved in picking the right mutations for your plague, keeping a low profile, not killing too many before you are discovered and later killing them fast enough before they can develop a cure for you.\n\nThere are several different plague types, Bacteria, Virus, Prion and more. They require different ways to evolve them to be sucessfull. The Neurax Worm which was added with the last patch was the most fun for me. The hunting for achievements was fun as well, altough alot of them arent implemented yet.\n\nThe game originally was made for mobiles and is now ported to the PC. It feels pretty good and polished for a port.\nIf i had one negative thing to say about the game then its about the bubble clicking, which gets tiresome and annoying after a while. Also it feels a bit too pricey, ~10 Euros would have been a much fairer pricepoint in my opinion.\n\nYou can get a mobid kind of satisfaction out of beeing sucessfull in this game, knowing that you just wiped out a whole planet. I just couldnt resist getting it, and overall i am sure i got my moneys worth out of it.\n\nAs long as you dont expect deep strategy you will have a good time with this game.\nIts a nice timewaster with suprising complexity below its shell.","March 7, 2014","true","43.3"," 103 of 123 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","103","123","0","10"

The short answer: If you like strategy games, or are fascinated by the idea of creating your own pathogen to destroy humanity, buy this game, especially during a sale.\n\nThe details:\n\nThe base game is a genetic strategy game where your goal is to infect the world and destory it before they can do the same to you. It offers plenty of options for doing so, and the game is simple enough in the lower difficulties for newcomers to get a basic idea of what to do, but in harder difficulties, it is challenging enough for even veteran players to have a difficult challenge. The game has many different plague types and modes to try, including user created plagues.\n\nThe multiplayer mode is also fun, sporting many strategies that counter other strategies, with quite a bit of depth. Would advise AGAINST newcomers to the game from playing that mode first, as it is much more intense of an experience compared to the main game.  Against friends or randoms, the multiplayer is a great addition to an already great game.\n\nI've played this game ever since 2012, whenever the game first started out on mobile devices and there was only 6 plagues and 3 difficulties. This game has kept my attention and still manages to be a fun distraction and experience to come back to time and time again. So, if you seem at all interested, pick it up, it's a strategy game that's worth the price.\n\nP.S. This game will make you hate Greenland. You will understand why.","December 1, 2015","true","11.2"," 49 of 49 people (100%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","100","49","49","14","0"

It is very one-dimensional and once you've figured it out (should take about 15 minutes at most) that's it.  Sure there are levels and things to unlock, but the bottom line is that it should only be purchased on sale.  I paid full price and I regret it.\n\nThe rundown:\n\n-Fun, but the same way a single level of mario is.  You can do it a few different ways and win.  You can unlock things and play it again (in the same way) and win.  Satisfying the first three times and not much more.\n\n-Educating, but not in a good or useful way.  It gives legitimate details about pathogens but nothing else.  Like reading the cliffnotes of "all about disease"\n\n-Entertaining in exactly the same way smallpox was, take that as you will.\n\n-Replayability is hugely limited due to the limited nature of the game.\n\nI'll admit to enjoying it the first two times through the rest of it wasn't so enjoyable.  I know I only show a few hours of the game but that's all it takes.  There's a basic strategy that takes you though twenty minutes of playtime and that's it.  Buy it on sale and enjoy it but NEVER pay full price or you'll be left with the knowledge that you did nothing but pay for an undergrad to fail his midterms.","November 28, 2014","false","3.3"," 696 of 1,031 people (68%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","68","696","1","19","26"

The graphics and gameplay are rather simple but the end goal is to dominate the world with those little red circles of infection.  Timing plays a huge role in evolving and deevolving traits depending on the type of infection.  For instance, if your plague is too severe before you attain widespread infection, humans will begin working on a cure before you have time enough to infect everyone.  Conversely, if you are too wide spread through transmission abilities, you might not end up with enough DNA to be lethal enough before a cure is found.\n\nThe Planet of the Apes add on is very interesting.  I'm still experimenting with it but unleashing a virus that makes apes more intelligent and combat humans is quite entertaining.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/recommended/246620/","EdenStarGazer","EdenStarGazer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EdenStarGazer/","429 products in account","Plague, Inc. is a smooth playing simulation and real-time strategy game. It is highly intriguing and elicits quite a few time-sensitive questions on a relevant topic today... for everyone. Whether you are concerned about Contagion, Plagues, last-days scenarios, or bio-terrorism; Plague, Inc. is there.\n\nIt doesn't take too many play-throughs to realize that not all diseases are created equal. But, the game does draw you to multiple play-throughs, as you spin out each scenario, captivated by the results of minor changes in your strategy. The game starts with a basic menu of disease types in the main-game portion: Bacteria, Virus, Fungus, Parasite, Prion, Nano-Virus, Neurax Worm, Bio-Weapon, and finally Necroa (Zombies) and the Simian Flu for those who want to turn Earth into the Planet of the Apes.\n\nThe game is overflowing with feature-rich side scenarios; from real diseases past and present like The Black Death and Smallpox, to the fantasy diseases like Pirate Plague and spreading Christmas Joy, and myriads of others. And, if that weren't enough to keep you busy with the 142 achievements, they have included a workshop, so you can download community made scenarios and/or create and share your own.\n\nHigh Strategy:\nThe premise is simple enough. You create a new disease and your goal is to watch it spread around the world. Naturally, since it is a game, you can't win by simply covering continents. You must wipe out humanity for a victory. You are able to name your disease, and choose the genetic traits, as well as the symptoms and the transmission traits for spreading the disease, whether it is something that spreads from insects, birds, by air, or sea... etc. Then, as humanity fights for a cure, you try to stop the cure before you've covered the planet.\n\nDie-Hard Fan:\nI originally reviewed the game in early access. The game has gone through many updates, and since then I was able to participate in the alpha and beta testing phases for multiplayer, which was added to the game along with the full release. So, I've updated this review to reflect all changes.\n\nThe game has given me more than 150 hours of fun in early release, and now with over 300 hours in-game, I am still exploring all the fun and challenging levels. When I first started exploring this fascinating game, I found I was able to beat the Virus and Bacteria easily; finishing off both in one play-through each. But, I found the Fungus Disease and the Black Death scenario both to be very difficult to spread before they were cured by Scientists. But, they all are accomplished with time. The game definitely contributes to obsessive personality traits, like repeated hand-washing, and 12 hour gaming sessions.\n\nI managed to turn the Earth into a 'Planet of the Apes' with my own Simian Flu on the 2nd try. The first time, I had tried to develop the rampage gene. It didn't spread far before the humans managed to develop a cure. Too aggressive! So, I slowed it down a bit, and worked on the Simian side of the coin; developing colonies of apes, and making it spread among them, while increasing their intelligence. When the Earth was covered, I added deadly symptoms to finish it off with one quarter of the ape population surviving the human drone attacks, which were colossal-scale.\n\nNarrative:\nThe game is imaginative and rich in story, not-surprisingly since plague is the story of civilization. The main game plays out on a world map. If you watch the news bits, and little popups, you see that some countries begin to execute and/or bomb whole cities of the infected, out of hysteria and fear. The disease spreads in real-time, as you are making changes in the control panel to try to counter-balance the reactions of the humans to your disease. But, there are speed and pause buttons for those who want to control the action. Also, in the single-player, opening up map and disease screens automatically pauses the game so you can get back to bursting dna bubbles when you are finished making changes.\n\nI've already decided that Greenland is the place to go in the case of world contageon. They are so isolated that many games are lost simply because Greenland closes their ports to prevent the plague spreading.\n\nGraphics & Sound:\nThe graphics are first-rate; utilizing a variety of color and fx cues to help you monitor the situation as it develops. The different countries are covered with the color of your disease, and then turn to black as the humans there all die. The control windows are amply stocked with a variety of graphs and charts to analyze your disease's progress, and at game's end, to analyze why you won or lost. The music is intense and dramatic. Different sound bits include children singling "Ring Aaround the Roses" which was a children's song from the Middle ages about the Bubonic Plague.\n\nMultiplayer:\nYou can choose games with friends, random matches, co-op or versus mode. Leader boards let you know how your opponent ranks. The multiplayer community is already spreading and many more are dying for a chance to win the co-op brutal achievement. These achievements, though easy to obtain if you have a good working partnership, would probably be more difficult if you don't chat or talk to the other player to coordinate. You can't play "by the seat of your pants" here. It takes team-work.\n\nPros:\n*High Strategy and realistic simulation gaming at it's finest\n*Multiplayer Vs. & Co-op\n*Extreme Replay Factor\n*High level of control-The element of choice makes you feel like a Superman in game. When you make small changes, big things happen.\n*Friendship forming- You will develop close partnerships in the multiplayer co-op, because you won't win otherwise.\n\nCons:\n*You will not finish this game in under 100 hours. My testing buddy 100% it in under 200 hours, even with all the beta testing hours. I'm not finished yet.\n*Though guides are certainly helpful, having a list of steps won't guarantee success because your timing and decisions effect results.\n\nVerdict: Plague Inc is an awesome game that makes the scientific/academic investigation humorous.  You get to enjoy what would seem on the one hand an evil and diabolic plot to exterminate the world, and on the other a biology experiment. I highly recommend this game for everyone above age 12. I rate this RTS game a 10 out of 10.","July 5, 2015","true","302.4"," 45 of 47 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","45","47","3","5"

The PC version has features added which the mobile version doesn't have unless you buy them (the different viruses) differences listed below:\n1. PC version includes the Necroa Virus, Neurax Worm AND the Simian Flu. For the mobile version you need to buy them which costs $8.96 (incuding base mobile game).\n2. PC version has a new UI.\n3. PC version gives you a bigger screen, and if you have touch you get a bigger touch screen. (Not a big deal though)\n4. Custom scenarios, if you are getting bored of the regular plagues the game gives you, you can play scenarios the steam communtity makes, or you can even make your own.\n5.

Updated frequently, Plague Inc: Evolved is a Strategy and Simulation game where you control a plague in an effort to wipe out mankind. You can evolve, and devolve one of several, plagues, viruses, and worms, in your quest to destroy the world. There are multiple game modes which have their own strengths and weaknesses and require different strategies to win. Converting the world into Zombies with the Necroa Virus, or Enslaving the human race with the Neurax Worm are just Two examples of the variety Plague Inc: Evolved offers.\n\nRecently Plague Inc: Evolved released a 1v1 multiplayer mode, where you can play against others. This mode offers different options than the single player modes and can be a lot of fun. There are so many different ways you can go about playing this game, it can become quite addictive. I would recommend if you enjoyed the App version to get this game for the PC as you will not be disappointed. If you are new to the game, and enjoy killing or enslaving billions of people, this game would be right up your alley.

But hey, maybe it's actually worth the money?\n\nThe game is an advanced version of the old Flashgame Pandemic II, which was a great game of it's time and I truly enjoyed playing it. Actually, that's the only reason I decided to get Plague Inc anyways. Now, Plague inc is a bit more advanced then Pandemic, no doubt. The mutations system ismore complex, the graphics and algorythms much superb...\nBut it doesn't add much else.Once you figured out the basic route, the game is literallyjust clickclickclick-wait-win. Every single time. The different plague types only change that at a minimal level.\n\nLook at my game time. I havejust finished the game, unlocking the cheat plagues (those giving you godmode anti-cure or unlimited evolution points). How? Just by doing the same thing a dozen times over again, with every plague the game offered.\nAnd that's it. And they charge 14€ for that.\n\nNow, a big point for me was the Multiplayer mode. I could really see potential replayability value there...\nBUT it's not even remotely implemented yet.\n\n\nSo, my resume: Great concept (duh, they imported it from a great and innovative old game). Fun gameplay. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ repetitive and no further content to keep you playing. In it's current state, 2-3€ sounds like a nice price. If they really go up ahead and add a GOOD multiplayer mode, I'll gladly change my review. But till then, don't buy this.\n\n\nPS: Quick update:\nThey STILL didn't add the promised multiplayer, but instead keep throwing in 'more different plagues' that play usually exactly like any of the others, adding nothing new to the game.\n\nPSPS: 6 months later, they ACTUALLY added a multiplayer. Albeit I feel trolled by the fact it's not the 'human vs virus' multiplayer I was actually hoping for.","February 22, 2014","false","7.8"," 1,092 of 1,735 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","092","1","0","89"

The virus can do this by itself, with enough time (you will absolutely fail in the end), but you can also evolve it by upgrading several of the many upgrades. For example, you can let birds or other animals and rodents carry the virus to other places and countries, or you can make it less vulnerable to humid environments. The goal is to infect and kill every person on the earth, by all means necessary. And all of this is done in a very realistic way, and it's a blast to play, let me tell you.\n\nOne thing that should absolutely be fixed, though, is the fact that pop-ups (mostly for tutorials) pop up in EVERY SINGLE game you play.

Though the enjoyment you take may be a bit... questionable, I think?\nI mean, you eradicate humanity with a disease. Trying to imagine how people would suffer from your creation would make you sick. Thankfully, all you see is world map and few other windows.\n\nThe difficulty the game provides is very flexible. Either go for a smooth killing spree or struggle with cure progress.\nThis game also features A LOT of upgrades for each disease (there are quite many of them which you can unlock).\n\nCome to think about it, it's a strategy game. You start somewhere and expand until you take over the world. Or in that case, kill everyone (though it's not always necessary).\n\nThere is also a multiplayer mode. Both versus and co-op are fun to play and can give you quite a challenge.\n\nI'm not really sure what else I should write about this game. Maybe workshop support? Millions of custom scenarios and an editor to make your own? Yeah, I guess I should mention that either. Oh wait, I just did. Anyway, that's all I can say.\n\nIf you are into strategy games (or even if you aren't) and don't mind infecting the world, then go ahead and try it.","February 18","true","40.6"," 53 of 70 people (76%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","76","53","70","9","0"

Glad to see they're adding some new things to their PC version. So lemme just recap the good things:\n- You can name your disease "Cuddles" or something ironic like that\n- You act as the god or scientist on a sattelite, upgrading the abilities, symptoms, and the types of spreading of the disease while watching over the world, making sure your virus spreads by any means necessary\n- Any player can play this game pretty easily once you get the basics handed down. If you're just a casual gamer like me then just go to casual mode, or if you like a challenge and realism go to Brutal mode to test your knowledge on how a disease outbreak can destroy the earth (in the game of course :P)\n- The game itself doesn't require a good PC to run, I'm running this on my laptop which has a medicore graphics card and it still runs fine with no issues.\n- Loads of information on the screen, both based on your disease and world events (news, cure research, activity, etc)\n- The disease tree allows the player to add a more personal touch to their disease and it doesn't force you to stick to a certain pattern to win, contradictory to what I just said it all depends on your knowledge on how an epidemic starts. For example: a disease that can only be spreaded through water and hot climates will eventually be cured if the traits are kept that way because the world is smart in this game.\n- Diseases in the game have a pretty "realistic" nature. If a disease can be spreaded through kisses and hugs it can do that. Be careful though, humans are realistic too, and will eventually thwart your plants by stopping people from hugging and kissing each other eventually. Plan your diseases carefully and upgrade them to the best of your abilities, or personal taste. Make sure to stop the humans from finding loopholes to your epidemic by finding loopholes in their ways of curing people or at least stopping the spread.\n- Controls are pretty straight forward, just point the mouse and click. No need for mulitple key bindings if you don't want too, but that's up to personal preference to dictate whether it's good or not to have a game relying on a cursor most of the time.\n\nNow lemme recap the bad things:\n- Trying to attempt this game in real life (by that I mean actually starting a real disease) will get you in big doo doo\n- If you can't understand what disease is and how it spreads, as well as basic disease terminology, this game may be difficult for you\n- Blindly picking stuff from the tree is bad, I've been there and had my disease stopped on Casual difficulty (the easiest difficulty in the game). Reading IS required for the game since the symptoms and diagrams provide you with hints on what each symptom and trait your next choice have and how they behave.\n- Recap: Reading is required. Not too much but you need to at least have a basic understanding of reading and some big words. If you don't like reading, then this game isn't for you.\n\nAll in all this game is great! I hope they keep developing more things to add to it. Been a fan ever since the app came out for phones and tablets, still a fan for the PC version :D","November 30, 2014","true","7.7"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","41","52","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rosina/recommended/246620/","Rosina","Rosina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rosina/","101 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReally excellent game.\nIt's a simple plague simulation game that involves a lot of strategy to try to infect and destroy the world. The infection patterns are quite realistic. To start off, the plagues are fairly simple bacteria, but you unlock crazy plagues (allowing zombies, for example).\nGames are pretty quick, running 10-30 minutes from my experience.\nYou can name your own plague, creating many hilarious phrases to pop up during the game. Stick to singular nouns or proper names and you will get some amazing combinations.\n\nFor anyone worried about it being early access, there is more than enough content to keep you busy for a very long time. If the creators hadn't told me it was unfinished, I wouldn't have known. I still look forward to updates (which the developpers are keeping up with), but it's not an incomplete game without them.\n\nOn a science note, the only real problem I have with this game is how mutations occur in all the Plague cells at once. In actuality, a mutation would only occur in one instance and then have to spread again from the new patient 0. It makes the "infect everyone then evolve deadly symptoms" tactic to lose some of the magic.","March 13, 2014","true","16.0"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","0"

With all kinds of different disease/virus types, gene modifications, and the choice of which symptoms you want your disease to display in its patients.\nDifferent ways the disease can be transmitted, resistances to temperatures and different climates.\n\nI like to think of this as a kind of "total world-destruction solitaire". Take that how you will.\nSome of the game is very skill-oriented, where as some times on harder difficulties you may rely on the chance of your disease spreading to other continents and having to re-try several times, if not sever dozens of times. So that's the luck part.\n\nThis game is very in-depth strategy that puts you in the role of a vengeful, wrathful evil god (or perhaps scientist, who knows?)\n\nIf you ever played the popular flash games Pandemic or Pandemic 2 years ago and enjoyed them, this is your game.\n\nIt draws obvious inspiration from those games, but adds even more depth and realism to the strategy involved.\nMore ways to destroy humanity, more information on how your destruction is coming along, better visuals.\n\nIn all ways imaginable it is a beefier, better re-creation of Pandemic into a higher-tech envinronmnt than just flash games would be able to bring you.\n\n\nOverall, for being in early access, I still feel like I got more than my money's worth. Plus, there's new content being added, constant fixes, and upcoming multiplayer with versus and co-op.\n\nEasily a 10/10\nHighly recommended","December 5, 2014","true","74.5"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

Really glad to see it in the steam store!\n\nIt's an interesting - if grim - plague simulation/strategy, wherein you get to "conquer" the world with a different kind of "empire."  Despite how unbelievably morbid the concept is, it's actually a pretty fun game.  It's good for a casual way to pass time, and its harder difficulties offer a lot more challenge for those who really enjoy strategizing and thinking about the next move... because one wrong step can actually throw your whole game and see your plague destroyed.\n\nBeyond that, there's a bit of learning to be had as well, if only because the information pages on each of the countries are like little encyclopedia entries that offer up real world information.  Of course you don't HAVE to read it, but it's pretty awesome that it's in there.\n\n10/10 for sure, even as early access.  It's a complete game.  It's fun and engaging.  You might even learn something while you're frightening yourself with the strange ease of wiping out humanity.  Unless you turn up the difficulty, in which humanity becomes a little more tenacious.  :)","October 31, 2015","true","6.7"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

It's one of the most complete games I've played. Rather bug-free as well!\nTo the game: I don't feel like explaining what this is about, you can find that info elsewhere, easily.\nAs for the price-tag, if you're planning to explore the game to it's fullest, i.e.: do all or most of the achievements, you can spend a LOT of time with it. I spent about 50 hours in game (counter shows more but idle and so on..) and that's about how long it took me to do all of the achievements. And these get really hard in the end! But it adds to the fun for me. For people who are uncertain as to if this game's worth the money, I recommend just trying out the phone version. Yeah, the content on the mobile version is largely the same, but due to the nature of touchscreens and the capability of phones, it's rather dull on phone - I feel. Sometimes you just lack the tempo to do certain tasks in a certain speed on touch, while on PC it's much easier with all the hotkey and mouse controls. It's simply more manageable. Aside from that, on mobile you have to pay for "DLC", while on PC you get everything for 14 bucks. Also you have triple speed here on PC, while only double speed (max) on phone. To everyone saying this is a slow game, I recommend upping the game's speed, you'll have your hands full with work, especially on higher difficulties.\n\nIf you're the kind of person that's not even interested in playing a game to it's fullest, someone who's like "yeah I'll try every mode out once on the easiest difficulty and move on" then no, this game probably has very little to offer for you and thus rather low value in regard to it's price.\n\nAs for the multiplayer that's still in development; I feel multiplayer on a game like this is needless. But apparently, people seem to enjoy it (unlike me). But I guess MP is, in today's world, a high value proposition for most of gamers.\n\nAnyway, if you've liked what you've read and seen, maybe stumbled across this review, I can wholeheartedly recommend buying this game under the above circumstances.\n\n","January 10","true","70.5"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","27","34","2","1"

I think that despite it being in early access, this game is already quite ready for sale, with no glitches or crashes, but the devs are fixated on creating much more, including multiplayer. I played the game a many times and found that its methods were highly legitimate, as the different events that often occur such as the Olympics allow the plague to travel more quickly to other countries around the globe. I particularly like the way your plague can evolve into a greater, more deady, and more infetious disiease (I once made everybody s**** their pants in public). The game's "street veiw" is not as cool as I had expected it to be, but the graphs and such that display the amount infected, deseased, and healthy, as well as the depiction of the country's state of emergency both helps and entertains. It is fun to watch people fall disaterously to your evil, diabolical plague. This is my opinion of the coolest strategy game I've played for a very long time.\n\n8/10","February 25, 2015","true","10.9"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","23","28","3","0"

Well, there's a reason for that. This game is bland. It's the same thing over and over again. Doesn't matter if you play bacteria, virus, bioweapon, or parasite. No matter what you start as, you well end up doing the same thing: getting cough and sneezing, upgrade water and air transportability, increase cold and heat resistance, get a single point into drug resistance and maybe a point into slowing research, wait until the whole world becomes infected, then upgrade to total organ failure and whatever else you choose to accompany your leathality.\nThe real "trick" of the game is doing just what I said, but do it quickly. There is little to no challenge to it and there's no reason to deviate from a certain "be all end all" disease build unless you want to roleplay that your disease is unique which causes paranoid people to stay up all night ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ their pants. Regardless, you'll end up getting coughing, sneezing, and segway into total organ failure (and I know you will).\nThe game costs more than the mobile version and has less content with little to show for. I know it's "unfinished," but these silly early access games keep biting me, and other gamers, in the ♥♥♥. By the time the game becomes something fun or original, I would have already been left with a sour taste in my mouth with no want to play it again.","February 27, 2014","false","3.5"," 363 of 628 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","363","628","3","46"

The game is clearly something unique and interesting. You can develop your own strategies, which you actually need to do for each disease type. Bacteria and viruses I find are very similiar to what they are in real life - so for example viruses are mutating very quickly which is actually true based off of real life studies. I highly recommend the game for the unique idea, good gameplay, low hardware requirements and of course the hyper-realistic world. I hope the game will get better and better as I did find few bugs or errors with the workshop maps which could be caused due to the Scenario maker and not the author him/herself. I give the game a solid 9/10, would recommend.\nPS: I did play the game on my friend's account for a long time until I could actually buy it.

The game pretty much speaks for itself. Though the game sometime feels like it is designed for smartphones, it is very fun nonetheless.\nNO SPOILERS AHEAD.\n\nPros:\nThe Idea of Plague Inc is very unique and the concept is very nice.\nThe Gameplay is fun and addictive.\nThe Variety between the types of plagues is good.\nThe Zombie and Planet of the Apes Plagues are a ton of fun to play with.\nThe Atmosphere at the end of the game is very chilling. As the last humans are dying, everything on Earth stops which can give you such an erie feeling.\nThe Steam Workshop makes this game 10 times better. User Created plagues with custom timelines and traits are very awesome.\n\nNot Sure:\nI don't like clicking on my screen every couple of seconds to catch the bubbles. This clearly is a mobile mechanic in which you need to keep clicking on your screen. When you level up, eventually there is a gene which automatically pops the bubbles for you which a must have.\n\nCons:\nThe Game does get repetitve after you figure out the formula for the game which doesn't take that long.\nMany major countries are missing from the map.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nOverall, Plague Inc: Evolved is a very nice game.

IF MY OPINION CHANGES DRASTICALLY OR WHENEVER THE GAME IS RELEASED FROM EARLY ACCESS, I WILL REWRITE THIS REVIEW.\n\nDo you or have you ever despised humanity? Do you like video games but you're tired of the same old shoot em ups? Do you want something (fairly) new and unique? Well, my friend, this is the right game for you!\n\nCreate a disease from a variety of disease types (which you have to unlock... fun), select special traits for your disease (also unlocked... more fun), select your difficulty, and infect Patient Zero. You then choose some skills to evolve your plague to make it more lethal, easier to infect others, or resist outside forces (i.e. temperature and drugs). Unfortunately the governments of the countries aren't very keen on the idea of you eliminating the human race, so they'll shut borders, airports and harbors and try to cure your disease, so you'll have to race against the clock to infect the world and evolve enough lethal symptoms to kill the world. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThe gameplay is fun, there is a bit of strategy on choosing which country to infect, whether you want to be able to infect by air or water first or if you want to invest some points to get bonus infectivity in colder countries. More strategy comes when you get traits for your disease, since they add bonuses to infectivity, extra DNA points, and a couple more nifty abilities. Each disease has some varying traits, like virus evolving frequently, biodisease being so deadly you have to suppress the lethality, nano-virus being built in with a kill switch that you must race against, and there are much more. It's worth it to unlock the diseases, since some of the cooler ones like Neurax Worm (mindcontrol) and Necroa Virus (zombies) are unlocked a bit later and it's always fun to mess around with those. There are also random events that happen that will affect the game, making each experience different.\n\nThe display looks nice and it's easy enough to see what's going on. There's a cool little body chart that shows you where in the human body your disease affects. You can see what's going on in all countries, how they're combating your plague, how their cure research is coming along, and if the government is still stable there or if it's falling apart.\n\nThere are also scenarios where you mess around with stuff, mostly stuff like little to none plane transmission, a mirror version of Earth where all of the countries characteristics are reversed, a virus that's DNA is damaged, affecting its transmission, and some more. Steam Workshop also makes an appearance, letting you create your own scenario. The communuty for this game is pretty large and I can see multiplayer being popular when the dev releases it.\n\nThere are some problems I had with the game, most of them small however. Mostly minor stuff like Portugal being part of Spain, Alaska being part of Canada (to be fair, the dev makes fun of this in an event so I dont care about that :P), Hawaii being nowhere to be seen yet, minor stuff like that. I can see this game becoming a bit repetetive, but it hasn't become that for me yet. One thing I would like to see, though, are different... I guess maps, you'd call them. Stuff like the continental USA with all of the states instead of the whole world, the providences of Canada, a map where the melting of the ice caps has flooded the world, stuff like that. That would make the game more replayable.\n\nRegardless of any criticisms I may have, Plague Inc Evolved is a breath of fresh air with plenty to offer and more to come. 9/10. Never has a game made me hate a country for no good reason like this one has. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Greenland... Anyway, get this game now. It's worth it even at the full $15 or your regional equivelant. Just know that this is an Early Access game, so the game isn't complete yet. However the dev updates frequently, so it could be coming out of Early Access soon. Either way, though, it's worth getting. So get it. NOW!","December 23, 2014","true","47.4"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

Otherwise, the game meets its own goal but I can't recommend it since it's painfully static and repetitive. I spent 2 hours playing it but it felt more like 20...\n\nToo long part\nThe game has very fascinating background and it's very exciting to discover everything it has to offer at first. But as you go on, you realise that while the content is wide, it's also quite shallow. You basically spend your time staring at a world map and some pulsing red dots progressively expanding over time.\n\nThere are also red, orange and blue bubbles to pop every now and then, which in all honestly seems like a very very desperate attempt to make the gameplay look more dynamic. I imagine this whole concept works amazingly on mobile devices but it's just not good enough on a PC.\n\nAnother way to spice things up is various events which occur in a more or less random fashion. Most of these are opportunities which can be abused to spread your disease faster. Problem is that these events tend to happen on the other side of the globe and you don't have enough resources to react in time.\n\nI also feel like there is a huge gap in the difficulty levels, as Normal can basically be beaten by not actively doing anything at all while Brutal seems almost impossible in comparison. If humanity starts working on a cure and you havent infected every single person on the planet yet, you basically lost the game because you usually don't have enough resources to deal with the cure development and security precautions. At Brutal and Mega Brutal difficulties the discovery feels very random which is what makes it so hard and infuriating.\n\nFun thing to note is that island countries become impenetrable fortresses once the cure development starts and you haven't infected anyone in there yet.","June 17, 2015","false","2.1"," 106 of 179 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","106","179","5","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JosieKaylin/recommended/246620/","JosieKaylin","Josie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JosieKaylin/","116 products in account","*artwork/animation: (10/10)\nFor what the game is, there's not a whole lot of demand for an exceptionally rich animation. That being said, I think the devs did such a great job with creating the atmosphere for this game with how the game is visually displayed. I played this game way back when there were only a few different game modes and I have enjoyed watching this game develop and progress the way it has. On the preview screen where you can pick your disease type (aka: game mode) they give you a preview of what the virus actually looks like. I think this is such a simple touch but it adds so much to the game. It won't leave you wondering what in the world a prion looks like haha. They show you the diseases being transmitted and they show you how many people are dying and becoming infected. They show you pictures of the world becoming devastated. It's really cool and simple.\n\n*Sound: (10/10)\nAgain I have nothing really to complain about or to critic on for this section. They add music which creates the atmosphere for the game, they add sound effects for when you collect points, when people start becoming infected, when they develop a cough you hear people coughing; it's really subtle though, don't worry. Plus half the time you're too busy wondering what your next move should be to even listen to the background noise but with out it, would this game be the same?\n\nHours to complete: (10/10)\nThis varies. It depends on how long it takes you to infect everyone, how long it takes you to kill everyone, how long it takes you to read through all the transmition options and abilities as well as learn them. How many different times you had to retry to beat the disease, etc. However, you can get so much play time from this game. Not only are there 10 different disease types to chose from, there's also 4 different difficulties for each one. Not to mention the 139 different achievements there are.\n\nStory line: (10/10)\nIt's pretty self explanatory. You're controlling a disease to devastate and kill off humanity. That's literally it. I will give it originality points for sure.\n\nGameplay: (6/10)\nWhat? You didn't really expect me to give this game all 10/10 did you?? No matter how much I love all the little details and everything in the game the most important section is the gameplay of course. So let's start off with how this game works. You pick your disease, you name it, you pick where in the world you want your disease to start infecting, you wait for DNA points (this is how you upgrade your disease) you select how you want it to transmit, you select how you want it evolve, you wait for everyone to become infected, you resist their cure efforts, you select your symptoms, you wait for everyone to die, game over you win. On to the next disease type. This is literally the entire game. Now there are a few different disease types that do follow a different order in order to beat it, for example, the necroa virus. (aka: zombies) but for the most part, you're following the exact pattern I just listed above. Don't get me wrong, it's a fun game and there's a lot of customization involved, but will you be playing this game for 6 hours straight? Probably not. You'll most likely get bored of the repetition with in the first few hours. That being said though, it is a nice game to have if you're bored with the other games you have and need a nice little break from them. Or for procrastinating like I am at the moment.\n\nPrice: (7/10)\n$14.99 currently.\nThe price is meh. You get all the customization, all the achievements, all the unlimited hours of game play, etc etc. But why it hasn't fully sold me for this price is only based on the fact that I can't find my self playing this for hours straight. I don't want to pay $15 for a game I'll get bored of within 2 hours and have to come back to later you know? If that doesn't bother you then go for it, if it does, grab it when it's on sale.\n\nOverall:\nI love this game and have for years.\nI would recommend this game to people who like:\n> World domination\n> Achievements\n> Customization options\n> Casual games","February 20","true","5.8"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","15","17","3","0"

There is a huge amount of replayability either through trying out harder difficulties, changing which genes you select at the start or what syptoms you use to wipe out humanity quickly.\n\nBeing able to name my disease has always been one of the things I've loved about Pandemic, and now Plague Inc.

Examples?\nTeam Fortress. Counter Strike. Half Life. Dead Island.\nIn these games you kill hundreds, thousands.\nBUT in this game - MILLIONS, even BILLIONS.\nChoose your own way to kill everyone - bacteria, virus, parasite, even Neurax Wrom that can manipulate humans.\n\nSome could say after around 10 hours, that game is a little boring. Why?\nThey do same thing over and over again. So why not try scenarios? And if they tried already, they should try custom ones.\nAnd if even custom ones got boring, then try multiplayer.

It was painful to wait for it to go on sale but so worth it.\n\nThe basics of the game are to infect the world--literally. You start off in one country and watch it spread. Now that sounds boring, right? Wrong. The game gives you updates on how your virus is constantly infecting people. It updates you on how harmful it is, if there's a cure being made, if people are sick or dying. You can slowly watch the world going red.\n\nThis game is a wonderful strategy game. It seems easy but it's difficult considering you have to fight against all of humanity to keep people sick. While it is hard, it's addictive. If you ever have to start over you won't really complain. It's one of those games you can just play over and over and not get sick of it.\n\nPlus, like someone else said, who wouldn't want to kill all of humanity?

It's morbid and distubing, but before you know it, you'll start getting a creepy grin every time you get the message, "there are no more healthy people remaining".\n\nAs of now, yes, this is basically the mobile version on a bigger screen, but the things they have in the works for the future sound AMAZING.

All of them are really nice additions that (with the exception of VS Multiplayer, arguably) help boost the game's longevity, the same way new disease types have done for the mobile version.\n\nFor the most part, you're gonna be staring at one of three screens: the map screen (showing the disease spread), the disease screen (where you can purchase traits with accumulated DNA), and the world information screen (showing the measures being taken against your disease as well as progress towards human extinction). Anything you can think of is shown, even as graphs detailing your statistical growth, the percentage of population infected and dead, and the cure research conducted and needed.\n\nA little thing that's making it more enjoyable to play through is just reading through the symptoms and trying to imagine what unholy suffering I'm causing to the humans, slowly appearing on the map as darkening red dots that stop shuffling about as they poop out their organs. Talk about being morbid and sadistic.\n\nThe price tag may put you off, especially if you've played the original mobile versions and/or find the additions potentially unnecessary. Just to be sure, grab it on a sale, and let your inner mad scientist free. A million is a statistic after all. Or perhaps 7 billion even.","March 8","true","51.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","14","17","0","0"

Like many people I played this game originally on my cellphone and found it to be quite entertaining.  The whole game is here and I really have nothing against it or it's strategy.  Heck, it's one of the few mobile games I liked because it actually fit the medium it was made for.  And yet, that's the core of why I cannot recommend it:\n\nThe game was better on mobile.  This experience is built for a touch screen.  The point and click gameplay it utilizes is clunky on my HD display where the menus feel too large, unfocused and under utilized.  The interaction with your virus was highly detached on a small screen, you were an observer as you tinkered with it's evolution.  The 'pimple popping' made sense with touch but it feels like substitute gameplay with a mouse.  The simple evolution of your virus made sense on the bus but it feels like substitute gameplay at my desk.  Perhaps it is because I knew it as a time-wasting mobile game and that is exactly the type of experience I don't want when I put down my phone.  Perhaps it's why AdVenture Capitalist is fun on the go, but I have no urge to play on Steam.\n\nThen again, you ~can~ play it on a cellphone or tablet still and get the 'authentic' experience.  This may not be the worst port of a cellphone game to the PC but at the same time it's just not any better.  The pick up and play is gone.  The swift menu navigation is gone.  And the pop-ups which somehow didn't bother me on mobile are positively aggravating here, it's like an endless flood of tutorial messages.  It's good for a few minutes of your time but it's just better where it originated: in the palm of your hand.  All the gameplay which fit the mobile genre well feels like a wasted concept and for ten dollars you could easily buy something far more interesting.","February 18","false","0.2"," 118 of 210 people (56%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","56","118","210","8","3"

You can approach the game in a very simple mindset and have fun with it, or try to approach it tactically and find challenge in the many different ways to play each type of disease. The interface is very simplistic and some of the notifications have some witty humor to them, along side the satire news banner.\n\nSome of the best fun is naming your disease something utterly stupid, so you can laugh to yourself reading the pop-ups.\n\nThe game has four difficulties, and a wide varieties of diseases each one can be developed differently for different victories. In addition to the many different countries and locations to start, each one will provide different challenges for your disease. Casual and Normal difficulty are pretty much for the average player, with normal providing some good challenge. Then the game ramps up to Brutal and the dreaded Mega Brutal in which disease seems impossible.\n\nYour goal is simply regardless of how you choose to play. Destroy humanity. Infect everyone and increase your diseases lethal level till no survivors remain. The shorter number of days it takes you to wipe out humanity, and the smaller percentage of the cure determines a scoring system.\n\nThe music also sets the tone very well, and in some disease missions the music is slightly altered. The sound effects are simple but excellent for a title like this.\n\nFor only $15, this game has plenty of replay value and is a ton of fun.","October 15, 2015","true","26.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","10","11","3","0"

Plague inc was originally an iOS and android game and has now come to PC via Steam early access. Now you no doubt know what the game is all about so the purpose of this video is to inform you whether it's worth your hard earned cash.\n\nDeveloped by one-man developer Ndemic Creations and released originally for mobile devices in 2012 Plague inc went on to be the 15th most downloaded paid iPhone game of 2012 in the U.S. (and 18th on iPad). In March 2013, the game went on to win multiple categories of the Pocket Gamer Awards, including Overall Game of the Year.\n\nThe game itself is a plague simulator, the object of the game is to infect and kill the entire world's population. Once you have selected what type of plague your going to use, be it bacteria, parasite or a myriad of other options. You then go on to select where you plague will start by selecting a country of your choice. Throughout the lifespan of your plague you can evolve it, not only increasing its infectiousness but also it's lethality. You accomplish this by purchasing various so called evolutions with DNA points. DNA points are earned naturally by the plague spreading but also by clicking the DNA and infection bubbles that pop up on the world map as the plague spreads.\n\nAs your plague spreads and starts causing fatalities, authorities will start to take notice. At a certain point scientists will begin to research a cure for your plague and then the race begins to see if you can kill the populace before a cure is developed. You can hamper the cure research progress by popping the research bubbles on the main map and by also purchasing evolutions that hamper research development.\n\nI really enjoying Plague inc on my iOS device last year, I thought it was a fun little title that had some replayablity but it certainly was not a core game. So it begs the question is this title worth $15 of your hard earned cash? And before the complainers out there say, well you can't critique an early access title, I'll say this, if your asking money for a product, I'm damn well going to find out if it's worth the money for people or not.\n\nIn its current state on early access, it is not worth your money especially since only the main game, which I might add is the same version as the mobile game, is available. Why spend $15 dollars on something that you can pick up for less the $3 on your mobile device. That being said there are some new features coming to the game like multiplayer, speed run mode and scenarios but even then will it be worth it?\n\nFor me personally, to make the $15 really worth it, this game will have to produce a great multiplayer experience. The multiplayer needs to add what the single player experience lacks, re-playability. While the cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes do sound like fun, I do doubt it will hold people for long. I think the single player could have done will some rework too, if it was me, I would have added some micro gameplay elements in there to add to the experience. Everything in the game is on the macro level, I would have added in some new levels. For example like in spore where you start of as a cell and as you grow the level gets bigger, what you could have done here is start of in a town of a country, the aim would be first to spread your plague across the country, then the game would go onto the world level.\n\nI really feel that small changes like the addition of levels would have really added to the game and make spending $15 for what is essentially a mobile game, a more justifiable purchase. I'm not saying that Plague inc is a bad game, on the contrary its a very fun, if not superficial simulator. I simply feel that in its current state it is not worth $15 of your money, once the additional features are added especially the multiplayer, it may be worth another look. But for the time being, I'd wait either until full release or if your just interested in the single player, pick it up on your mobile device.","February 22, 2014","false","3.0"," 217 of 396 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","217","396","0","4"

Hence it being in my Strategy games library category.\n\nBasically what you've got here is an experience akin to the mobile android game Plague Inc. Only awesomely enough it's the same cost as all the DLC for that game combined.\nPlus looking at the prospect of Co-op and even Competitive Multiplayer, Custom Scenarios (likely implemented via the workshop) and the existence of Speed Runs, a Leaderboard, and even a virus not currently featured in Plague Inc. The Simian Virus as a reference to the Planet of The Apes series.\n\nYou start with Bacteria, Then Virus, and later control Fungus, prion and even my favorite and one of THE EASIEST plague types in the game, The Neurax Worm, a plague that is essentially a brain worm (Alpha Centauri's Mind Worms, anyone? :D) tha can either kill or mind-control, allowing for a second victory alternative.\n\nWhichever plague you start with, the object of the game is to kill all of mankind, save for the Neurax Worm which can turn all of humanity into a slave race (which in my opinion is better than killing them all).\n\nThere are 7 plague types, and they all play differently, although a couple feel or act similar, no single plague works the same as another, which is the important part as nobody wants to play an FPS where 60% of the guns all act the same, or an RTS where 5 units are literally the same thing with a paint job.\n\nThere is easily a wealth of content as the game itself is fairly tricky with plague types like the Necroa Virus, a plague that can turn people into zombies.... or just act like a normal plague... which doesn't work as well as when a zombie, you have abilities you can use.\n\nIf you oppose Evolution, or find killing humanity in a simulation wrong somehow, or you don't like Simulations or Strategy games... Then this game isn't for you.\n\nOtherwise, if you're okay about either point, or like any of them, then I highly encourage you to get a copy of this game, It's loads of fun, allowing for more than 6-24 hours worth of gameplay if ignoring the achievements.\nTo get them, I'd imagine that number would triple easily.\n\nThis game's a blast, I personally see it as a 7/10 in it's current state, it may easily rise in the future as I just cannot forget future features like Co-op, which I am absolutely ecstatic about.\n\nSo yeah. 7/10, once leaving Early access, I will come back and redo this review.","July 19, 2014","true","64.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

A game of creating and evolving various types of illness to wipeout mankind. Be it bacteria, virus, parasite, zombies, simian ape flu (Planet of the Apes), nanomachine or a man made biological death virus you are tasked with infecting and ultimately wiping out humanity. Transmission, Symptom and Ability are the three areas you will dabble in making your virus hardier in different climates and against man made medicine and air / water filters. Symptoms tend to come in three areas as well. Infectivity, severity and lethality. The trick is to keep infectivity high while keeping severity and lethality low initally. Should the latter two get too high countries will begin researching a cure for your illness.\n\nWhile essentially the exact same game as the mobile app, the real fun comes from the Steam Workshop. Everything from demonic possession, the four horsemen of the apocalypse, Terminator-like machine uprisings, AI self awareness (I Have No Mouth and Must Scream), spider-based armaggedon, the 1982 'The Thing' and many more. Be it the coming of dragons, vampires, werewolves or transforming into a propane loving Hank Hill this game provides amusement with slight resource management and is well worth picking up on sale as a time killer.","January 23, 2015","true","47.1"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I didn't really play to much of it on my mobile device, but the computer version got my eye and had a lot more visual effects and easier to handle controls than on the mobile device app.\n\nThe task of the game is to kill all humans with a deadly pathogen. The game also offers genes (perks for your pathogen) that makes the game easier to handle. I didn't find really any negative problems with the game, but I do recommend it to people that like scientific strategy games. The game also relates to one of my favourite subjects in school science, but you actually play as the pathogen instead of the humans.\n\nFavourite disease?

At the same time, I also happened to be dealing with my 3rd week of mono symptoms. In a weird sort of way, looking up information about the virus actually inspired me to finally pick this up.\n\nAnd I'm glad I did!\n\nTo summarize, this game is basically a simulation of the transmission and evolution of a disease. You control transmission methods, symptoms, and abilities with the object being killing everyone before a cure can be created.\n\nThinking about your decisions is crucial. Can't just kill off everyone immediately because it cannot spread. Cannot make it too passive because the cure will catch up to you. So, you have to find a balance.\n\nWhile it may be a dark premise, which might put some off, the game is pretty solid. Hoping multiplayer is on its way soon.\n\nAdded bonus: You give your disease a name. So, have a giggle killing off the planet's inhabitants with "Kindness", "Puppies", "Mad", and "Your ♥♥♥".","June 25, 2015","true","10.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","1"

Simply put, if you enjoyed Pandemic, theres no reason to hate this game, it's better in everyway.\n\nThe music is good, however it can get repetitive at times.\nThe graphics (If you can call them graphics) are nice and bright, and everything stands out so you know what is what, nothing blends in.\nWhile Pandemic had 3 diseases, this game HAS A LOT more and creative ones, plus thanks to the Steam workshop, theres pretty much an unlimted amount of diseases you can play as, plus if you want to make your own, it's very easy to learn!\nThe game while simple and repetitive, it's still a lot of fun and has a lot of Easter Eggs in game, including a Minecraft reference and more.\n\nHowever theres one downside for me, and that's you unlock some of the content by playing a disease in a specific difficulty, this sounds good, but most of the time from my playthroughs, some bullcrap keeps happening like the following.\n\nI never get enough DNA points to stop the cure OR get the upgrades I need.\nThe game has an ♥♥♥ pull and the cure sky rockets while the upgrades don't help at all, they barely help.\nSome upgrades feel like they do nothing, for an example I got an upgrade to increase lethality, but people die at the same rate as before.\nIf my disease has nearly no severity, it will get spotted no matter what... this is really unfair when I have a PIXAL amount of severity and I pretty much lose when I just started the game.\nWhen I try to play sneaky and spread then kill, I keep getting random upgrades because my disease is evolving, this can help, but most of the time ruins the game for me.\n\nI would have prefered to have all the stuff unlocked at the start and have "Beat this difficulty with X disease" just as achievements, rather then having it locked.\n\nOverall it's a fun and basic game, if you enjoy Pandemic, theres no reason to say no to this game.","April 12, 2015","true","6.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

FIFTEEN DOLLARS FOR A GAME FREE ON MOBLIE!? THIS IS A OUTRAGE!?. But I can assure you it is niot. The game while being basically a polished better graphical version of the first game is basically what it is though. BUT do NOT forget. This is only in early access alpha and it already has allt he feautures the phone has. Imagine how it's going to be when fully done and released. Also this game includes the things you qwould normally have to pay for on the phone FOR FREE! I know right? That means you can fast forward without having to spend a dime! And the game itself is great. They will be adding tons of new and great feautures to the game so tis worth the 15 dollars to be able to watch these things come out. Now is probably a better time to buy it then before because basically all the diffrent straijns you can be. From bactiria to bio-weapon. They're all great and require a lot fo diffrent approaches. This game WILL give you tons of hours to waste into it and in my own opinion truly worth the 15 dollars. Also buy paying for it in  early access you'll be supporting the development of the game as he makes it. So buy it or don't I could care less what you do. but all I'm saying is that it will NOT be a waste of money.","April 23, 2014","true","26.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I thought 'Early Access' meant you had to put up with flaws and crashes and incompatibilities.\n\nTHIS GAME is polished, clean, and almost fully functional. This is one of the rare cases where you actually feel like you are getting your money's worth for a game that is unfinished. The game is fully playable. Sure, there are certain pieces not included, such as custom scenarios to play out, or new plague type, but we have already seen an update that includes some of that. If you enjoy the mobile and flash versions of this game, this much more refined desktop version is a great buy. Early Access or not.\n\nPlague Inc: Evolved is a simple concept. Take a disease and evolve it to the point where you can infect and eventually kill the entire human race. While the premise is simple, the tools given to you to accomplish this are vast. Multiple different 'bugs' to infect with (Bacteria, Virus ... Bio-Weapon, Mind Worms....) and many paths of evolution give this casual game huge replay value.\n\nFor those familiar with the simpler versions, here, the graphics are a bit more refined, easier to look at, but with no serious changes in design. Mostly you are presented with a simple World relief map, an interface by which you can evolve your plague, and an information screen regarding the World's progress to fight you or more information regarding those countries your are so desperately trying to infect. Simplistic perhaps, but it is all that is needed.\n\nThe audio soundtrack isn't going to win any awards, but instead provides the creepy horror movie ambiance that infecting the world with a nano-virus that spreads through open oozing sores, causing folks to have trouble concentrating and suffer narcolepsy, full system failure, and death, should have. Creepy hospital noises, disembodied coughs and fear abound.\n\nOverall, I feel this is a great buy. You have a fully playable, fun game for a good price. This game already has multiple difficulties, types of plagues, and lots of replay. Plague Inc: Evolved is being updated regularly with new features at no extra cost. A few of the new features promise to add not only whole new ways of gameplay, but community support in the guise of scenarios designed and uploaded by your peers to play. Oh! Did i mention it supports cloud saves? Save your game at home, and play it on the road from your laptop!\n\nIf you are a fan of casual gameplay, and not a fan of the humans winning... then this is the game for you! So grab a pair of rubber gloves, slather yourself in some Purel, and let’s see what happens when a super bacteria escapes a lab in North Korea...\n\n8/10\n","March 2, 2014","true","25.9"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Your choice of pathogen and genes will affect your gameplay.\n\nThe challenge of the game is to try and beat the game with all kinds of pathogens, they have different types of mutations that you can research with some unique attributes and abilities.\n\nThe game is a tablet/mobile port, which is noticeable by some of the UI but in this type of game it isn't really an issue.","June 24, 2014","true","6.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

For those who are already familiar with the mobile version:\n\nAll additional content is or will be included but has to be unlocked during play. The visual presentation was adjusted for the PC and looks way better. The world map looks beautiful, and the country pages now include a textual description and camera surveillance. You get much more stats about how your plague is performing, and as a bonus, you can save and load your game at any time. Other gaming modes like speed run and campaigns will be added, but those seem to be added to the mobile version as well.\n\nFor those new to the game:\n\nYou get a quick to play, casual strategy game with an interesting theme and excellent visual presentation. On first glance, it may seem repetitive to just having to add perks until all humanity is wiped out. But the different plague types and random events require different strategies. It's quite rewarding when you succeed with your plague on the harder difficulty levels. As an additional challenge you can try to get the over 50 achievements, some of those are very interesting and require additional thought.\n\nPricing and Early Access:\n\nI won't discuss the price as it is a personal choice of how much one wants to pay for a game. But compared to many other mobile ports, this one stands out because it was adjusted to PC standards and not just copied over. Also, for an early access game, it is quite stable and the basic gameplay is already there. I did not encounter any bugs, there are of course some very minor issues.\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you are on the edge, and the price is ok, then buy it without any doubt. If it seems too expensive, then at least get and try the mobile version. There will be a steam sale eventually ;-)\n","February 26, 2014","true","123.6"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/recommended/246620/","etherasfox","Etheras","http://steamcommunity.com/id/etherasfox/","325 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFull disclosure: I'm a strategy game junkie, and am therefore more likely to view them favorably.\n\nPlague Inc is a "God Game" map game where the goal is to transmit pathogens to all the zones on the map. The player selects a type of pathogen and a starting location, and then manages the development of the pathogen by evolving attributes like abilities, infection vectors, and symptoms, typically to spread the furthest possible before anyone notices, and then bringing on the symptoms like a sledgehammer to become as virulent and dangerous as possible to thwart research efforts.\n\nThe Good Highly innovative adaptation of the traditional Risk-style "map game"\nSolid gameplay, good controls, decent pacing\nStrangely satisfying to see a country hit that threshhold where your virus gets runaway growth and red floods the region\nAlso strangely satisfying to thwart human efforts at a cure. Seeing the research bar making negative progress, or even better: when you go virulent so quickly that the UN plane never appears, or where the world is dead but some ports never got closed... very satisfying indeed!\nFun to try out different sets of genes and symptoms and watch the results\nDevelopers continue to stay engaged, despite the fact that the game really is DONE. New scenarios get dropped from time to time to keep the game fresh and new. The Nureaux Worm spreading Christmas Cheer was especially cute and fun.\nNureaux Worm in general is just amazingly fun\nNice quick game. Game time is about as long as it should be for a game of this complexity. It never gets to the point of "Are we there yet?"\nPlanet of the Apes tie-in is brilliant\nCool music\n\nThe Bad The single biggest "bad" IMHO is the number of things that players have to unlock. I wanted to play as a Prion right away, but you have to GRIND through several previous stages to get there. It really feels a bit like jumping through hoops.\nStrategies don't change much. For the most part, you want to (1) infect everyplace before anybody has discovered you, (2) get as deadly and dangerous as possible once its likely you will infect everybody. The only real exceptions to this are the Nano Virus, where you start out discovered, and the Zombie Virus, where zombies can continue to spread the plague. Even the symptom selection is pretty straightforward, but I won't get into that because discussing those strategies would constitute spoilers.\nSome game modes are extremely hard without unlocking genetic starting abilites. For example, the zombie virus you really need to play as Creationist or there's little chance of getting the whole world. Yet I got the Zombie virus long before I got the creationist gene, and wasted a lot of time on an (arguably) unwinnable scenario.\nHumans develop cures unrealistically fast, even on easy mode. I suspect that developers decided the speed of research by choosing what was challenging for the player, not for any type of realistic scenario. I mean... how long have we been trying to find a cure for AIDS? While it makes for a better game, it weakens Plague Inc as a simulation.\nBubble Popping mini-game is silly and should just be eliminated. You "pop bubbles" all over the map for 3 different scenarios: to collect a bit of evolution (orange), the patient zero in any new country (red), or to squash ongoing research (blue). These reflex mini games really have no purpose in a strategy or simulation game. I suspect this was added because this was released for tablet too, and they needed to give players stuff to reflex-poke to make them feel engaged. (PC Gaming Master Race has a longer attention span, and doesn't need trivial casual mini-games to stay engaged)\nRandom Events can really determine victory or defeat, especially on really close games. If you've read my reviews before, I'm sure you're well-aware that I consider dicerolls in strategy games non-strategic, and a no-no. Plague Inc really relies heavily on dicerolls, whether for random events, mutations, "drops", or deciding whether or not an infection spreads onto a transmission vector (plane, boat (etc)). There are no dice rolls in chess. Strategy games should be about strategy alone, not luck.\nName never made sense to me. Plague Inc? Where's the Inc? You play as a virus, not a company.\n\nConclusionGreat game, despite some minor blunders to cater it towards mobile audiences (bubble popping and unlockables). Otherwise its an awesome concept well-executed. Its a smallish game with short "levels", so if you're looking for deep rich gameplay or a story, this one might not be for you. It really is more of a simulation, despite the gamified elements. But I enjoyed it thoroughly. And now I know that Greenland is probably the best place to be, if there's ever a plague.\n\nThanks for reading!","April 17, 2015","true","19.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Your role from that point is to design the ultimate bioweapon and devistate the world. Prove you have what it takes to become the ultimate serial killer and spread you message through the world.\n\nThe aim of the game is simple, kill every last person in the world. This is achieved through a 4 step process:\n\n1. Spread your pathogen to the far reaches of the globe.\n2. "Evolve" said pathogen to become the ultimate killing machine.\n3. What as society crumbles and combines forces in a pointless attempt to stop your murderous rampage.\n4. Profit?\n\nPros:\n- Quite a few different types of bio killing things including viruses, bacteria, plagues, diseases and so on.\n\n- Lots of upgrade paths to increase the severity of the, killing effectiveness and rate of transmission between the scumbag population of Earth.\n\n- Various elements of the game affect how your virus spreads, these include: various characteristics of the country, randomized events and the symptoms of your virus... the scientists can't work when they can't control their bodily functions right?\n\nCons:\n- Lack of interesting visuals, everything is fairly static, there is a webcam type thing where you can see how the population is coping but the images are shared between different locations (no landmarks), the webcams only provide static images which change as you progress  (not videos)\n\nAll in all an awesome game and highly recommended for those who like strategy games and aren't picky about visuals.","March 1, 2014","true","24.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Didn't even have any interest for it at the time... however, due to the game's popularity and increased number of positive reviews, I purchased it for myself. Did not regret it in the slightest.\n\nUnlike most strategy games, you REALLY have to consider how to indirectly make your virus (or disease) wipe out humanity. Every little choice matters, and can affect you in the long run. What I love about this game, is that humanity doesn't die easily even on, well, easy mode! They'll fight it till the end, and it's fun seeing who'll win. You or the world.\n\nEvery feature is unique, and I haven't seen a game like this in a long while. Everything that happens is recorded, you will get News of the latest events until your virus becomes deadly (or known) enough to make countries start worrying. It's realistic too since countries will start coming up with ways (news wise, or strategy wise) to stop your virus from killing everyone. It doesn't even stop there-\n\nThe more you unlock, the crazier (or creative) it becomes in you wiping out humanity. Extremely fun, plus the game is nice enough to let you speed things up since it can take awhile for the infection to spread country to country. Best way in taking any mode on is to make your virus spread quickly without hurting people (even a cough will make doctors eventually look into curing it.) Luckily you can devolve your virus's symptoms so that it doesn't end up drawing attention. Not to mention you can name your virus anything, and a LOT of events can occur in which your last run didn't activate. I somehow caused Japan to have a nuclear plant explode ... and that's just 1 out of the 103 events lol.\n\nI give it a solid 9.5/10 and it's just in Alpha. I cannot wait till it's fully done.

It also helps that it takes a while to unlock all of the different types of plagues. The news headlines are amusing. I like to read those while I'm waiting to get more DNA points. Oh yeah, sometimes it can take multiple minutes to save up points, especially early-game when you haven't infected very many people yet. Also, as a pedantic person it bothers me that you can become "antibiotic-resistant" as a virus. The game obviously isn't supposed to be scientifically sound, considering it contains zombie viruses, so I'll let that one slide.\n\n...I always feel slightly guilty when I win a game, too.","April 24","true","25.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I've been playing on mobile for more than two years, and I must say that this version is more challenging. Since everyone has reviewed the single player, I am going to review the competitive side!\n\nIn vs mode, you are pitted against another (human!) player. You start out with un-modified bacteria, and you participate in games to unlock more stuff. One thing to remember is that tactics that worked on single-player may totally shaft you! For instance, all genes now have postives and negatives, and you may only use three at once! For plague types, there are currently three- your starter Bacteria, which has losts its ability; and two others unlocked at five victories: Virus and Bioweapon.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fairly simple- upon starting, everyone is given a short amount of time to find a country to settle down in. You may NOT both start in the same country! The starter phase is hide and seek. Depending on what country you started in, you start with different amounts of DNA. You also continue to get DNA bubbles... until you starting location has been found out. The other team then gets a boost in DNA. Note: Being a high-profile disease tends to work poorly in concealing your starting point. It is hard to see the other disease's locations at first.\n\nFor abilities and perks, they switched it around A LOT. Your stardard Air and Water traveling transmisisons are now teamed up with Dust (Arid) and Sweat (Humid). For symptoms, the previous symptoms are joined by 2 orange ones. These will unlock a tree that will either make the enemy plague's carriers easier to infect, or protect your own. Both are useful. Abilities has a serious overhaul. There is an ability that lets you fly planes to uninfected countries (like Trojan planes!), an ability that focuses cure research on your opponent in that area, and a buff that increases lethality and infectivity for BOTH diseases.\n\nAll in all, I would give the multiplayer an 8/10. It's not perfect, but it is extremely promising! I will look forward to Co-Op mode in the future!","February 18","true","109.5"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

(Some of you will probably recall cursing Madagascar for ruining your runs on it. Yeah. That one.) PIE is similar (in fact, I suspect its "casual" difficulty setting is based on that game), but a more well-researched and broad title. You start with nothing but bacteria as your plague of choice, but victories will unlock gene modifiers (for starting boosts) and new types of medium. That last chunk is where the craziness comes in: sure, viruses basically play like a more mutatable bacteria, but then you begin unlocking the real weird ones, like a fungus (such a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to spread...), or mind-altering worms (suddenly, the goal can go from "kill the world" to "enslave every living thing"), or nanobots trying to thwart their kill-switch... the list goes on, more are still being added, and each plays distinct from the others while keeping the basics of the game, so what you learn with one can carry over to the others.\n\nIf you worry it's just going to be a pushover, play with the varying difficulty settings or some of the mutator genes you get for victories. Figure out what types of symptoms combine to make you more effective, or take on the double-edged sword of being incredibly mutation-happy. All of a sudden, your disease isn't communicable ENOUGH, and your hosts are dying before infecting others...\n\nI really dig this, but you've gotta keep in mind, this is a dark game. It's a frighteningly-realistic simulator of ending the friggin world with disease (or worse). Victory is literally a mass extinction in most scenarios. I would absolutely NOT recommend this for everyone just based on that.","March 11, 2014","true","8.0"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The game has taken care of all the irritations of the online Pandemic (where Madagascar would slam shut its borders as soon as anyone merely stubbed their toe, meaning game over), diseases can cross borders via birds and insects even when border controls are closed and there are more factors to meddle with in the hope of being evil and spreading your new disease before anyone has chance to notice and work on a cure.  Additionally, successful completions of the game unlock new bonus traits you can collect and use to develop your own mutations and improve your chances of winning.\n\nThe developers have made an excellent job of the game and I'm glad they brought it from app to PC.","March 22, 2014","true","89.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

The first Bug you get to work with is the Bacteria. And on normal difficulty its... Easy to infect the world but it's also kinda hard to kill them all and i like that :) on my third playthough i ALMOST killed the earth But Them Danmded Icelanders survived to rule the world with just 1000 or so peeps >:/ and you CAN actually infect Madagascar CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? :D Holy geeze i almost fell out of my chair when i did that (not really thoe) But anyways. The one and only reason i bought this game is because of the ZOMBIES >:D YEEEEAH i wanna play the Zombies but alas they are 3 levels away :( but Danmit im gonna do it Just for them Zombies man i tell ya what :D its worth it just for the Zombies (for me anyways) But yeah this game is suprisingly challenging But fun even on Normal difficulty (thats just me don't hate me cuz i play on normal :l ) It's a good game a TINY bit, Just a WEEE Bit to expensive if yer the penny or... Nickel pincher type person but if not its worth every... erm.. Dime i guess .. yeah :D","May 24, 2014","true","9.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DustyBronco/recommended/246620/","DustyBronco","Dusty Bronco","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DustyBronco/","378 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDefinitely worth the $15. If you've played this game on iOS or Android, skip this paragraph. Plague Inc is a world-ending virus simulator. It started out on iPhone a few years ago and was a huge success. It consistently topped app charts, had a number of really cool free updates, and it just gives you so much to do. The CDC even liked it enough to meet with the app creator and discuss how to make it more realistic! In this game, you control a plague (bacteria, virus, fungus, man-made plague, brain worm, and more...there's a lot to choose from). You choose where the virus begins, and you watch as it spreads across the world. You control what vectors the virus uses, how the virus defends itself against temperature and medicine, and what symptoms the virus produces (oh, and I'm just going to use "virus" as shorthand for "plague" just because I'm more used to typing "virus"). There's a lot of strategy involved, whether you try to create a nearly invisible virus that, when detected, it will be too late or if you try to create a virus that becomes scarier and scarier as it spreads and just overwhelms cure efforts. The game has been balanced to really support both options. As you infect people, new countries, and kill people, you gain DNA points that you use to alter your virus. The scarier that your virus is, the more you're rewarded with points, but the more that every scientist in the world focuses on curing you. Don't worry, however - the game does a great job of explaining everything to you. Whereas a game like Pandemic can be really intimidating with all of these different medical terms (even one for runny nose - are you kidding me?), Plague Inc prefers to use the common words for symptoms. You're not overloaded with choices (but there are enough for you) and the impact each DNA change has is clearly shown (such as infectivity, lethality, and how scary it appears to the world).\n\nFor those who have played it on mobile, not much has really changed. Each plague is unlocked after beating the previous one, there's the world map, unlockable gene bonuses, etc. However, it doesn't really look too polished as of yet. The UI feels outdated and inexplicably cheap. I almost feel like I'm playing a flash game in my browser. The UI is mostly functional, but has a lot of empty space. It also has some elements that are just for show rather than solving a purpose. For example, a bar graph to the right of the country status indicator (the main bar on the UI) has different colored bars that don't represent anything and don't move. I don't know why they're there. It's still early access, so that may change. Also, every country has a picture of it (mostly just showing people and buildings, maybe a landmark). The pictures look like cheap CGI (god knows why - there's no shortage of real pictures of locations), but there are maybe 10 - or less - pictures used for every country in the world. I don't mean that, say, Sudan cycles through 10 pictures. I mean that Sudan, and "West Africa," "East Africa," and "South Africa" (along with most of the rest of the continent) all have the same picture. Cheap CGI with nothing moving. At first I thought it was a neat touch, but that kind of shallowness stands in contrast to how fleshed out the rest of the game is.\n\nOn the upside, each plague type has its own 3D image that reacts as you upgrade it. It doesn't change as dramatically as the neurax worm on mobile, but it will stretch out and rebound a bit when you upgrade it and wince when you devolve a feature. I think that's pretty neat, and it doesn't feel as cheap. The DNA upgrade menu is definitely an improvement. Also, the world status menu has been solidified and now has all of the important info on one screen. That's a huge improvement.\n\nAlso, this game has Steam workshop integration, meaning that people are submitting their own plague types. I saw one for a Hank Hill virus earlier today. It looks like people are going to have a lot of fun creating and customizing their own plagues, and I think that's great!\n\nIn summation, it's the same as the mobile game, but with a new UI (with its ups and downs) and steam workshop support.","January 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

You see, Big Pharma has set up a campaign to harass and discredit me at every turn; its gotten to the point where I can't even go outside without fear of someone shooting me with a tranq dart.

So tired of Steam being so cluttered with expensive mobile ports that make it hard to find actual games among them. Then I read the positive reviews, here. Put it in the back of my mind. Fine, maybe it's decent -- but I'm not paying full price for this. Maybe when it drops to five bucks for awhile, I'll try.\n\nSomething spurred me to make the impulsive move to eventually buy the game, anyway. And I played it. And . . . it was good. It was really good. Not perfect and lots of room for more compelling and complex additions, but . . . a really solid improvement over the old flash game or the iOS game. This is the way you need to think about making a port to PC. This is the attention and consideration that should be paid.\n\nIf you haven't played this type of game before, go check out the mobile version. If you like that, you're likely to enjoy this a lot, too. If you couldn't stand that, the PC version might not be for you. In other words, if you liked the original, this is more of that - and better.\n\nOverall, $15 might still be a little pricey for this type of game. I think $10 would be ideal. It shouldn't be a deal breaker, though; if nothing else, put this on your list and come back to it when it's a little cheaper, if you are hesitant.","August 12, 2014","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Or is it? Maybe looks can deceive. First game I played when the game was on the fourth update on early access. They are adding features faster than I can learn to master them. If you think 40 hours of gameplay is worth 30-40 euros, then think how much worth of fun, and funny disappointments will you get for 13 euros.\n\nFew headlines:\nGameplay - You work on three views. The main view is the whole planet, where you can zoom, and scroll, and so on. And you have to click points. Like in  Farmville, except the potatoes are human souls that you are about vanquish.\n\nMusic - Eerie. Gives my nightmares. Or maybe it is just filling enough for the mindset about to destroy the best and the worst of humankind.\n\nGraphics - In progress. They are improving it all the time, and it fits the glove already.\n\nEducational/Morals - Well. Heh. You are taking the role of a god, and pick on the dominant species on planet Earth. You still have a very good excuse: They started it first. And it might have some hidden educational value as well. About how diseases spread, how everything is interconnected, blaah blaah.

I browsed on the Steam Store one day and found out that Plague Inc. moved onto PC.\n\nThe PC version is far different than the smart phone Appilication version. This version looks a lot better (since computers can handle MUCH more than just a smart phone) and feels more smooth. The concepts are about the same.\n\nThe PC version is a vast improvement since it's appilication version. Graphics have obviously improved. Some little things they've added onto the game really make a difference in setting this version from the app.\n\nIt's a lot easier to (if you're not good at geography) locate where countries are in the world menu. I'm very good at geography, so that was never a problem for me in the first place, but its a very nice addon. The diseases themselves have animations, and the water in the world menu has animations aswell, thus making the game look prettier.

I put in about 30 mins in the morning to get all the normal levels completed (21 hours total) and I really enjoyed the aspect of destroying the human race, (morbid, yes), but also give you an idea of how it can actually happen in real life.  Some say the price is kinda high and I would say, yes/no, yes the price is high, but for the play-ability of the game, I think it is just fine, but I did wait for the summer sales to actually purchased it.

I've successfully doomed the human race 50 times, and the game is still as fun as it was the first time. There are so many different diseases, genetic upgrades, and scenarios available that the game keeps fresh after dozens of iterations.\n\nThe co-op version is also a lot of fun, but it requires very good communication with your partner if you want to successfully obliterate mankind together.\n\nPro tip: watch out for the island nations. Iceland, Greenland, and New Zealand are the worst offenders, but Madagascar and the Caribbean have also proven problematic in the past. If you pull trigger too soon, those nations will spook, and close up their harbors, essentially locking you out of the country unless you get lucky with a mutation or special ability.\n\nOh and get ready for some BS when it comes to the Nano Virus. I've started in Japan (makes sense, right?) and within 3 to 5 days, BOLIVIA has grown concerned and started to work on a cure--because of one infected Japanese scientist on the opposite side of the planet.\n\nStill, the game is loads of fun, and I highly recommend it.","May 30","true","53.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","0"

Get it for that to play something when you need to kill time. Odds are your on Steam on a laptop or desktop and want to play a real game. This just doesn't cut it. On the phone its great. On here, its the phone app just bigger with some clouds and some added information screens. Certainly not enough of an upgrade to warrent $14.99.\n\nI'm sorry but seriously, fifteen dollars? I have games I paid less than 5 dollars for that are more involved with better gameplay and graphics than this. Again I can't say it enough, on your phone or pad, yeah this is a great game. I loved it, still play around on it when I'm killing time. But here, it's just not enough.\n\nBasically you have a world map, pick a country or area and start. As the game goes, clouds move some, boats and planes move around the map, and you occasionally pop bubbles. Sometimes you will have popped enough bubbles to evolve your disease, this part is just another couple of screens with a skill tree, oh and a simple animation of your disease, that will change as you evolve it, you rather will grow as you evolve it, no matter what you chose the picture will change the same way. Illusion of choice. Just not a very good illusion. My other issue with this game is the fact that when you start you can only play as bacteria, you have to beat the game on normal with bacteria to unlock the virus, and so on and so forth. So if you bought this game thinking about making some nanovirus from the future...yeah your not going to be doing that for a while. Cause you will have to unlock it and to do that you will have to play as certain things in certain styles. There are only a couple of for sure ways to beat the game with each type so instead of having the freedom to play as you want, to unlock everything you'll have to play very paticular ways. Again the illusion of choice.\n\nNow on the bright side of things, this is EA and the game will have features and things added in later. Thats great, I suggest maybe then you wait to buy it till its released. However, I'd take real close look at the screenshots, what you see is pretty much what you get.","July 6, 2014","false","1.7"," 39 of 73 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","39","73","2","0"

Its harder than you might expect but that's a good thing, the game is rather simple in terms of gameplay (it does feature advanced math to figure out how fast stuff spreads and people die) and it'd get boring if you didn't have to try different combinations to nail a scenario or the sandbox mode.\n\nAlso, pay attention to the voice of the guy during the intro video thingie.

Others you play to shoot things in the head. This one... you play to exterminate humanity. Fun!\n\nPlague Inc: Evolved is a game where you make horrible diseases, spread em around the world, and try to kill everyone before those pesky humans make a cure for your plague. There is strategy involved, but there is some luck too which can be rather frustrating (F***ing Greenland). The game is fun, but also relatively easy to master. Once you figure out how things work, the challenge is mostly gone. Good thing this game has plenty of opportunities for messing around.\n\nThe variety comes in the form of each different type of plague having different strengths or weaknesses, like viruses mutating alot which can lead to your disease being detected earlier than you would like. Most of the plagues are real, but the imaginary ones allow for some comic situations to arise. The Neurax Worm allows you to mind control people, leading humans to either kill themselves or worship the worm as a god. And, of course, the Necroa Virus, which allows you to unleash the zombie apocalypse rather than fighting it.\n\nThe game can get a bit repetitive in time, but there is alot of crazy fun to be found as well. So, if you want to play a game where murdering everyone is the objective, then this is one that can possibly satisfy. :)","June 26, 2014","true","48.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Even at $15, it's worth it.\n\nFor those who have only played Pandemic 2 and are wondering if this is better or merely an inferior ripoff, it's definitely a more comprehensive, fleshed-out, less frustrating, more entertaining game, even if the premise is very similar. All the skills (from avian transmission to projectile vomiting) are useful, and while some strategies are more prevalent than others, there's no be-all-end-all way to win the game like there is in Pandemic 2. I'm ten hours in and I'm still finding new ways to win against the odds.\n\nThe visuals are vastly improved over the mobile iteration, with red transmission dots forming across the world map as countries fall victim to your plague, 3D renders of your plague hovering in the menus, and image feeds of the cities popping up as they descend from normalcy into chaos.\n\nThe devs will be adding online multiplayer, Steam Workshop support, and tutorials (amongst other features) in the upcoming weeks/months, but it's more than playable now and I definitely recommend it if you loved Pandemic and want a superior version of it.","March 31, 2014","true","24.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is so good, and in a way it can be slightly educational. You can learn the symptoms! Get this game right now!

Feels good to be able to destroy humanity :P\n\nThe start menu seems promising; there are official scenarios, custom scenarios and even multiplayer. Not accesible at this stage. The options are kind of limited as to how you evolve your pathogen but again it's alpha. You unlock new pathogens everytime you successfully kill everyone and it gets harder to spread the new one. Right now there are 12 pathogens 2 of them not available and i'm stuck at the third one :D\n\nYou can mutate your pathogen which is really cool. You can make it resistant to weather conditions, difficult to cure. You can choose how it will spread. Sometimes there are random mutations which might get annoying because you want a sneaky pathogen but the random mutation makes it deadly.\n\nI like the difficulty levels. There are 4. 'Casual, Normal, Brutal, Mega Brutal'. Casual is fairly easy no one washes their hands there are no researches to destroy your pathogen. Normal, some people wash their hands some doctors work so they might discover the sickness. Brutal, THEY LOCK SICK PEOPLE IN PRISON :D Mega brutal, is even worse :D I'm currently playing on brutal and stuck on 3rd pathogen because before i spread it to everyone some countries already restrict access :(\n\nI recommend it but feel like price is a bit high","February 26, 2014","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

It's even better than it's old iPad equivalent, Plague Inc. I know some people don't like this game, and that's only because they don't like wiping out the entire world population with a deadly disease. There are plenty of plague types to unlock and each has different gameplay which I find genius. The main game where you pick your disease and kill the world is the main part, but they're already working on (and have released some) other assets to the game such as real-world scenarios like smallpox or the Black Death, as well as random scenarios where nobody cares about poor people. They're even working on a multiplayer race mode to see who can kill everyone the fastest. 10/10.

Which should be interesting :) But it is challenging as I said, you have to have a good strategy, I personally haven't managed to kill the whole world yet but I want to, you start off with only a Bacteria and then you have to win a game to unlock another type of disease.

You have to control the evolution of the Plague by spending skill points in detailed skill trees. The type of Plagues available to you get unlocked as you progress through the game, you start with only Bacteria available, you will go on to unlock Virus, Fungus, Parasite, Neurax Worm, Prion, Nano-Virus & Bio Weapon. These different Plague types will have either minor or major variations in the evolutions available to you, making for more interesting gameplay! Each game mode is unique in its own way, the different Plagues all seem to have game mechanics independant of each other.\n\nWhen you beat a level you will unlock different Gene structures, which allow you to get slight boosts or powerups in your future games, these are not needed for the normal difficulty, but can make Brutal or Mega Brutal difficulty go much smoother! There will be more Gene types to come, as this is early access, I have all Gene types unlocked (25/25), but it says that I am only at 83% on Genes unlocked, so we can expect to see more in this department.\n\nOverall the gameplay is fun & challenging. I would definitely say this is in the survival genre with a dash of world domination.

In it's current state there is still a lot to do and very enjoyable with tons of strategy planning and decision making that makes you pause the game and go through your options. My favorite part of the game is that there is a variety of diseases that all do different things, including a cheat one that gives you access to unlimited resources to evolve your disease as fast or as slow as possible. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes the idea of spreading a disease named whatever you want and seeing if you can infect the entirety of the world and ultimately kill 7 Billion people. It's a game that allows you to play the bad guy which is awesome.\n\nPros: Music, humor, interface, graphical style, decision making.\n\nCons: Still in Alpha with a lot of features not yet implemented.\n\nOverall: 9/10 would buy again and will continue to play","March 9, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you like strategy? Newsticker jokes about banning laughter and Canada annexing Alaska? What about terrible things happening to the human body, all for your amusement?

On a more serious note it's a pretty seriously engaging strategy game that balances actually having to think and plan ahead without being so labyrinthine and convoluted to navigate that it stops being fun. The interface is pretty, but might benefit from some streamlining as actually using it takes some practice (though it's perfectly fine once you do get used to it).

Well, alright to be fair most people haven't. But it is strangely satisfying to do in this game. The depth in each plague is just outstanding and a fun puzzle to solve. What worked in one plague may be your downfall in another. That kind of experience keeps me coming back for more and more, trying to overcome every obstacle laid out. While 14.99 does seem a tad steep for the content you get, the inevitable content makes it worth it and then some. Having put a lot of hours into the Android version and now working my way up on the PC version, it's a must have for anyone who enjoys a good strategy game. It's casual, it's fun, you won't regret it as a purchase. As a bonus, constant patching and content keep this a refreshing game.

You have to control the evolution of the Plague by spending skill points in detailed skill trees. The type of Plagues available to you get unlocked as you progress through the game, you start with only Bacteria available, you will go on to unlock Virus, Fungus, Parasite, Neurax Worm, Prion, Nano-Virus & Bio Weapon. These different Plague types will have either minor or major variations in the evolutions available to you, making for more interesting gameplay! Each game mode is unique in its own way, the different Plagues all seem to have game mechanics independant of each other.\n\nWhen you beat a level you will unlock different Gene structures, which allow you to get slight boosts or powerups in your future games, these are not needed for the normal difficulty, but can make Brutal or Mega Brutal difficulty go much smoother! There will be more Gene types to come, as this is early access, I have all Gene types unlocked (25/25), but it says that I am only at 83% on Genes unlocked, so we can expect to see more in this department.\n\nOverall the gameplay is fun & challenging. I would definitely say this is in the survival genre with a dash of world domination.

In it's current state there is still a lot to do and very enjoyable with tons of strategy planning and decision making that makes you pause the game and go through your options. My favorite part of the game is that there is a variety of diseases that all do different things, including a cheat one that gives you access to unlimited resources to evolve your disease as fast or as slow as possible. I would suggest this game to anyone who likes the idea of spreading a disease named whatever you want and seeing if you can infect the entirety of the world and ultimately kill 7 Billion people. It's a game that allows you to play the bad guy which is awesome.\n\nPros: Music, humor, interface, graphical style, decision making.\n\nCons: Still in Alpha with a lot of features not yet implemented.\n\nOverall: 9/10 would buy again and will continue to play","March 9, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Do you like strategy? Newsticker jokes about banning laughter and Canada annexing Alaska? What about terrible things happening to the human body, all for your amusement?

On a more serious note it's a pretty seriously engaging strategy game that balances actually having to think and plan ahead without being so labyrinthine and convoluted to navigate that it stops being fun. The interface is pretty, but might benefit from some streamlining as actually using it takes some practice (though it's perfectly fine once you do get used to it).

So the game has its strategic diffuculties and it does have its realistic atributes they have the pathegons down and just the stuff in it theres so much stuff along with Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes. And the thing is after i play games stuff always happens in real life. So after i play any game stuff that happens in the game comes out into real life.

I was slightly skeptical if a PC version could actually be any different and more enjoyable. Currently, it's holding up better than its iOS version and the regular updated with fresh content keeps me regularly coming back to try them out. Apart from that though the replayabiltiy seems to lose its appeal after you've completed each plague a couple of times ( unless you really care about completing each disease on the hardest difficulty ).\n\nSadly the scenario mode doesn't really offer much difference from playing as a regular plague, albeit with a few preset evolutions and different human interaction. The real stand out features are the Neurax Worm and Necroa Virus, both of which work very differently to the regular plagues. Whereas each disease follows a similar concept, evolve symptoms and transmission until you've infected most the world, then start killing people. The Neurax Worm & Necroa Virus offer different methods of completion, taking control of humanity through the Worm, or driving the human race to extinction through zombies with the Necroa.\n\nThe Simian flu is essentially an altered version of the Necroa virus created as a tie in for the Planet of the Apes move, I don't have a problem with it, and its definitely a nice addition, but it all feels a bit too familiar after you've turned everyone in to a flesh eating zombie a few times over.\n\nOverall the game is definitely worth purchasing, even while its in early access, although you might find yourself a bit bored as you approach the 30 hour mark, the frequent updates will keep you regularly coming back to try out new features and try your hand at the scenarios again.\n\n8/10\n+Regularly updated, simplistic design, cool plagues, Zombies\n- Gets boring after 24 hours or so, scenarios are a bit basic.","September 10, 2014","true","32.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's even better than it's old iPad equivalent, Plague Inc. I know some people don't like this game, and that's only because they don't like wiping out the entire world population with a deadly disease. There are plenty of plague types to unlock and each has different gameplay which I find genius. The main game where you pick your disease and kill the world is the main part, but they're already working on (and have released some) other assets to the game such as real-world scenarios like smallpox or the Black Death, as well as random scenarios where nobody cares about poor people. They're even working on a multiplayer race mode to see who can kill everyone the fastest. 10/10.

(Unexpected, right?) However, you have no direct control over the plague. Instead, you give it different abilities that sort of guide it throughout the world. That's the best part. You start at point A (One person infected), and you need to get to point B (Everyone dead). How you get there is up to you and your play style, and strategies vary from round to round depending on your traits and the enviroment around you. It basically boils down to a race against the clock, and it can actually be pretty engaging. One other good thing to be said is that it is a great time-waster. If you need to kill an hour or two or just want to play something casual, this game is great.\n\nIn short, Plague Inc is a interesting strategy title that brings in elements from simulation games. It sometimes feels more like a mobile app than a PC game, but nonetheless it is unique enough to consider buying.","July 2, 2014","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well then this is the game for you. Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death. Or you could do it the "passive" way and enslave them with a mind controlling worm, which is personally my favorite plague. Or if you're one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it's so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus. For those who own the mobile version, this is not some kind of scam. You notice that they put a lot of effort into the game and it even includes new things that the mobile version doesn't have.

It requires a good deal of patience and strategy to make it through. I love the attention to detail in this game, it adds to the realism.

The realism of this game is unmatched.\n\n"World of Warcraft" started in the United States and, admittedly, made a detour in Australia before spreading to and taking over Japan and China.\n\nPlague Inc: Evolved kidnapped the old Pandemic browser game, tied it to a chair and waterboarded it until it revealed its addicting secrets. They took everything right with the classic and expanded on that content, most notably, many more interesting disease types.\n\nI think everybody's favorite right now (though I haven't played to see the zombie plague in action) is the Neurax Worm; it's the one type (again; haven't seen the zombie plague yet) that has its own specific symptoms tree which leads to hilarious conclusions, as well as many more unique properties. I was a bit disappointed in the fact that all of the other plague types have identical symptom trees (you'd expect a complex prion or bio-weapon to attack the body differently than a bacteria or virus), though I'm sure that they plan on creating more variety as the game matures, which is alluded to nicely by the Neurax Worm's tree.\n\nPeople wary about early access: the game has yet to lock up on me, and other than a few display glitches with deaths and infected counts, it runs rather smoothly.\n\nIf I had to give one good reason to not purchase this game so it doesn't look like I'm hyping it up, I would say it's downfall is its replay value. Of course there's many different ways you can kill the world and ways in which you can choose to infect, but after one or two playthroughs, you can very well have seen and purchased everything. Until you get to the Neurax Worm, and like I said, I would stay optimistic that the other plague types will be updated with specific symptom trees later on.\n\nIs it worth $15? No, but is a $7.00 chipotle burrito that's going to leave bloody skid marks on your underwear worth it? No, but you eat the chipotle anyway, cause you're a fatty fat mcfatterson. Just like how you're on Steam and honestly trying to ponder the $15 like an investment banker purchasing futures. It costs like $40.00 to simulate driving a train. It costs $60.00 to shoot those gerd-dern Soviets. It's free to play TF2. The world doesn't make sense. You'll spend a lot more money on dumber things, like drinks for girls who'll never sleep with me. Consider this buying yourself a $15 drink where you can sit back, relax, and exterminate the world with a disease called "Snapchat."","March 30, 2014","true","57.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I wouldn't have played 16 hours of it if it wasn't.\n\nThe basis of Plague Inc, make a plague and try to exterminate humanity (though some plagues allow different endings, with the Neurax worm you can either make them slaves to the parasite or have the parasite tell them to all commit suicide, and with the Necroa virus you can kill off all of humanity with a horde of zombies infected by the virus, there are also different endings with other plagues in the official scenarios, one of which reverts humanity back to neanderthals).\n\nEvolving your plague and watching it's influence on the ingame world is interesting, you can slowly make the pathogen more severe and kill off the world in a very drawn out fashion or you can hide your plague, wait until everybody is infected and evolve it to be extremely lethal and watch society go from modern day to human extinction in a week. The news ticker on the top of the in game interface will reflect the state of the world and you will notice the ticker change as your plague changes, it's one thing that I like about the game, though eventually you will get to the point where you've seen it all as events usually happen multiple times throughout multiple playthroughs.\n\nI have a few gripes about the game, one of which is that you can use one tactic to pass a good amount of the plagues almost 100% of the time regardless of how difficult it is, but for the ones you can't use this tactic on I will note that Mega-Brutal difficulty is really.. really.. Brutal. As it should be, I've yet to pass some plagues after trying them repeatedly with different tactics on the difficulty, and I like that. Eventually I'll find the right combination at the right time, though thats not to say there is only one combination set for every plague, you can try many things, but generally there will be a few tactics that are both fast and efficient that should be used.\n\nTo those who have played the game on the phone, you won't be seeing much new here other than a prettier interface and 3d graphics. Though there will be more content later down the line, right now the phone and PC version of the game are pretty much identical.\n\nIn the end, is the game worth 15 dollars? Yes, though the game doesn't have a significant amount of replayability after you beat a plague on mega brutal with 5 stars, getting to that point took me over 10 hours, and even then I'm not completely done with all plagues, so the journey up to that point is a long but enjoyable one. There is promise for custom scenario support and mutliplayer in the future, which will hopefully make the game even better.\n\ntl;dr: The game is fun, and can be extremely difficult at tougher difficulties, the future updates promised look good and I don't regret paying for the game while in early access.","June 21, 2014","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well now you get to live out that sick fantasy, like a true Albert Wesker-in-training! Plague Inc. is rather morbid in its conception, but the gameplay is so fun you often forget that you're in control of ending the world itself. The disease types and modifications are varied and interesting, from a simple parasite to a virus responsible for turning people into zombies-- making for differing challenges each time. It requires a good deal of patience and strategy to make it through. I love the attention to detail in this game, it adds to the realism. The graphics are simple but effective:  Slowing watching a map of the entire earth as it goes from green (healthy), to red (infected), all the way to a grim black (death) is strangely satisfying.","June 25, 2014","true","18.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well then this is the game for you. Choose your plague, evolve it, and watch as humanity gets destroyed and see how it tries to defend itself from their imminent death. Or you could do it the "passive" way and enslave them with a mind controlling worm, which is personally my favorite plague. Or if you're one of those zombie loving people, well we got the plague for you. There is a virus that brings the dead to life. You can decide if you want it to simply destroy humanity with sheer force, or if you want your zombies to become vampires and only drink their blood. You can even bring back the mummified dead. Humanity even nukes the places with zombies in them, United States might even nuke China, or the other way around. I simply recomment this game because it's so much fun to play. I might also add that there is going to be multiplayer and diseases from the past like the black death, smallpox and the swine virus. For those who own the mobile version, this is not some kind of scam. You notice that they put a lot of effort into the game and it even includes new things that the mobile version doesn't have.

This mode is excellent, becoming an even more strategic battle between strategists.\nWith the full release out of early access, they have added co-op multiplayer which I haven't tried yet but I'd imagine it's excellent.

I just guided the symptoms and stuff. Then I got the notice in game that people were pooping in the streets and throwing up at the same time.\n\nThere are many other just straight disease types [virus, bacteria, fungus, zombie virus/etc] but also has scenarios where the world is set up a certain way and you are a specific disease made with it's own stuff or just a general one like above. Or you can make your own diseases using the several types as a base.\n\nThis game is great with each disease having it's own balance to win. With fungus, you need to really focus on spreading right. It doesn't spread like a virus, you have to plan when to do a spore release. Eventually you can evolve it so powerful that the whole world just has spores in the air. But you need to get the evolution points first.. which takes planning. So you can get crazy power but you have to think it through.\n\nMany great difficulties each describing exactly how it effects the game.\n\nResearchers and other stuff, among other 'enemies' in the game depend on your selection. But always end up starting to make a cure. Oh I'm sorry researchers is it hard to see through the microscope while bleeding out of your eyes? Does the cure become easier to find when you got sick too and now your organs are shutting down? Watch the lab! Don't want to poop all over those samples.\n\nOh wait, no, it's because your whole country is dying and has a few thousand survivors just waiting to die. Good luck getting the lab grant to fund research!\n\nOh and there is a Neurax Worm alien type disease. It is a creature that attaches to the brain stem, and spreads with eggs but you can modify it's evolution do spread and grow other ways.

Then I got the notice in game that people were pooping in the streets and throwing up at the same time.\n\nThere are many other just straight disease types [virus, bacteria, fungus, zombie virus/etc] but also has scenarios where the world is set up a certain way and you are a specific disease made with it's own stuff or just a general one like above. Or you can make your own diseases using the several types as a base.\n\nThis game is great with each disease having it's own balance to win. With fungus, you need to really focus on spreading right. It doesn't spread like a virus, you have to plan when to do a spore release. Eventually you can evolve it so powerful that the whole world just has spores in the air. But you need to get the evolution points first.. which takes planning. So you can get crazy power but you have to think it through.\n\nMany great difficulties each describing exactly how it effects the game.\n\nResearchers and other stuff, among other 'enemies' in the game depend on your selection. But always end up starting to make a cure. Oh I'm sorry researchers is it hard to see through the microscope while bleeding out of your eyes? Does the cure become easier to find when you got sick too and now your organs are shutting down? Watch the lab! Don't want to poop all over those samples.\n\nOh wait, no, it's because your whole country is dying and has a few thousand survivors just waiting to die. Good luck getting the lab grant to fund research!\n\nOh and there is a Neurax Worm alien type disease. It is a creature that attaches to the brain stem, and spreads with eggs but you can modify it's evolution do spread and grow other ways.

I was really looking forward to such games to come to the Steam Market.\nFor years now I've been playing a little flash game called "Pandemic", of which this is like the parent of. This game is absolutely great. It's difficult to beat, really makes you think and it does hold your hand a little, but scoots you on your merry way.\n\nPandemic was a simple interface. You clicked maybe three or four buttons. Start in random counties. Told you when all borders were closed or all flights are gone. Check boxes for symptoms and infectivity. Still let me enjoy killing time.\n\nPandemic 2 was more difficult. You had to watch a video tutorial to understand more about this game. For a flash game, bringing in a more RTS feel to it was alright. At the time it puzzled me and made me turn my nose, heading back for the first game.\n\nHowever, this is about Plague Inc.\n\nOnly a few hours in and the fun and frustration is flooding back to me. You can say a hearty "F*&# you, Madagascar, I'm going to infect you, first!" But when you're initially going to infect them, you notice little icons above their information. The fact that they've incoorperated statuses like Wealth, Humidity, Hot or Cold gives a major challange. Finding places that are less rural and more densely populated is great for growing viruses. You have to take more into account when you're trying to spread your nasty plague upon the world.\n\nMy advice? Do buy this game. Help the developers become a pandemic (Hehe) upon this market.\nIt is definitely worth the $15.00 and the tasty demo on Android really got me into this.\n","May 13, 2014","true","26.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Yes, you're killing all of humanity in an incredibly morbid way. But at the same time, there's a sense of accomplishment, which I guess would come from killing everyone, after all. But when you finally figure out how to kill humanity correctly, it feels amazing. Did I mention the fact that you kill humanity? Its pretty cool. Anyways, like I was saying, it feels great to unlock that new desease types, and the new infection thing. The game is incredibly expansive and has tons of replayibility.\n\nNow for a few cons! The game is a bit buggy for me, which of course comes with the territory with these early access games, but it never really gets in the way too much when playing the game. Another con that's not really a big deal is the fact that the max resoulution is extreamly low, but in all honesty it looks amazing regardless.\n\nOne of the best purchases Iv'e made on steam for awhile, I rate this game 8/10 at its early access state.","November 15, 2014","true","16.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of an intriguing little Simulator-type game called Plague, Inc. Plague, Inc has been around on mobile devices for a while, and on Steam since February 20, 2014. It is still in Early Access, but Publisher/Developer Ndemic Creations is VERY active, having just recently added the highly anticipated Competitive Multiplayer mode.\n\n\n(NOTE: This was a review from a game in my own Steam library, it was NOT provided by the Developer and/or Publisher)\n\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/60mmrRezNlE\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nGreat game, good casual way to pass time OR you can ramp up the difficulty and give yourself fits. Highly replayable. Active Devs. Another 4/5 on an incomplete game? Yup. Worth $15 easily.\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nI picked this game up a long time ago on my iPhone and loved it, so when it came to Steam I picked it up about a year ago around Xmas. I stashed it away, awaiting it's release from Early Access. Well, I couldn't wait and the newly updated Multiplayer mode gave me an excuse to review it anyways! Now, I didn't review the MP mode simply because I wanted gamers to get a feel for the actual game itself first. This game is a simulation game where you are trying to spread a disease and essentially wipe out mankind. You get points to evolve your disease in different categories (Transmission, Symptoms, Abilities) to try and help it spread and eradicate humanity. Meanwhile, the world works against you by crafting a cure, shutting down airports/harbors, etc. Pesky humans, you'll find, are quite resiliant. As you play and get better at the game you unlick different types of diseases and starting genomes for your disease. There is a lot here and this is all fun on it's own, but then you incorporate things like Steam Workshop, User Made Scenarios, Multiplayer and the like, and the replayability shoots through the roof. The best part....they aren't even done yet and are obviously very active in the games continued development. Hop on board now, this is not one to miss. 4/5 easily, even in it's incomplete state. There is MORE than enough to play here, nothing game breaking going on, they just keep adding more and more awesome stuff!!

I bought this game with high hopes as I played the original pandemic games as a child and was highly addicted to them for a while, but naturally I forgot about them and moved on. Now several years later a full steam release with polished graphics, new pathogens, more tactics and more realism? Yes please! The only thing I will say is at this point in it's development it is not worth it's current price tag, once they add in the mind control worm and zombie virus I have a feeling that will change. So in short, if you are looking to dominate the world as a deadly disease that cannot possibly be stopped and wipe out the human race in it's entirety, there is no better or more fun way to do it then Plague Inc Evolved (Either that or you could just manufacture a deadly disease and do it yourself :P)","February 20, 2014","true","21.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The anticipation to kill everyone as a virus, fungus, prion, or even bacteria just leaves you happy at the end when you beat everyone. Of course, this game is still in development so there are some stuff in the game that can't be used(Obviously). The strategy is just simply marvelous and sometimes really hard to achieve through your goal. Many strategies are involved in this game. Although, I do agree with some people that $15 is kinda of a rip-off, I understand that when you buy this game.

If you enjoyed the flash game Pandemic then I have no doubt in my mind that you will love this addicting little number. Now, If you're not familiar with the game, you basically choose a disease and plot to infect humanity with various transmissions and abilities.\n\nIt takes something so tragic and to be quite frank, utterly horrible disasters and makes it enjoyable to figure out your plagues strength and weaknesses and in effect destroy the world as quickly as possible without being cured. All that being said, it does teach how dangerous and quickly one tiny little bug can spread if gone undetected or if you go for the quick kill route, even dead bodies can be infectious which is where the danger really amplifies.\n\nI hate to drop the educational word as it tends to make games lose their appeal to some, but it really is without you even noticing. Having to tailor make each decision of evolving certain things to make it more lethal, infectious, to be harder to cure or to be hardier in cold environments etc. It gives you a sense of how they work as well as perhaps opening a different pathway for said virus. Given it may not be 100% accurate, it's still a good perception of it.\n\nWithin the main game you begin playing as the starter bug; bacteria. The most common thing and the easier one to beat to then unlock more complex virus's, and then in the next selection, extra add on's such as a start game bonus of DNA points and such. You can make it to suit your own play-style once you learn how the game works, which makes it so much more appealing.\n\nNow, from a completely different viewpoint, it can be seen that you're commanding these viruses to in simple, destroy everything. Which in itself is a fun stress reliever.\n\nWith the recent update of it being added to Steam Workshop, you are able to make some amazing scenarios as well as download some incredibly done ones from other people, just that expands the game so, so much.\n\nNot to repeat myself, but it does again add onto my constant point of how Steam Greenlight brings out a lot of talent that may generally get overlooked. With most of these games, the active development is incredible, so much work goes into keeping these games updated and bug free, especially this one. Also getting involved in making Christmas events are a nice sign of things to come for catered game modes and what not for different life events, I for one, love that. It gives the game character in the sense that it's basically involved in current events.\n\nTo conclude, this is an amazing game that I would recommend wholeheartedly, it's one that keeps on giving and deserves all the support possible.","September 28, 2014","true","48.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game brings from what I have experienced and stated above, hours of trial and error fun. The game is polished and looks great. A certain thing I feel I could bring up though are that in the fungus level, at least on the lower difficulties and I also believe on Brutal you can exploit the refund system to gain points by constantly refunding spore burst abilities.

Then now, the computer Version arrived which was a breath of fresh air :)\n\nThe Game is very pretty graphically, i also love the themes in question of trying to help to Donate to certain non-profits in-game making the gamers aware of what goes on. The game is basically just like the Mobile version but in a Prettier and more detailed Version . You get to understand the countries, weakenessess and strenghts of viruses better, the spread of the virus looks way cooler, and there's also everything unlocked (not having to buy in pieces like the mobile version)\n\nOverall, i enjoy the game a lot and for now i give a 8.5/10 for the game.\n\nWhat i would like to See enhanced/Improved?\n\nMore Music tracks, more viruses/Evolution. Maybe a Virus versus Cure mode Online?(thats just a wild dream), Some perks on the way you can play mechanically.\n\nIts a Early Access game so i do have high hopes for the future :) Keep the great Work!","December 10, 2014","true","15.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This PC version is SO MUCH MORE! When the game first came out I didn't get it because it sold game features a la carte -- and I vote with my dollars when it comes to things like that, taking a pass until it was being sold all in one peice. I'm glad I came back to get it! The interface is both familiar and developed, and you can have great fun evolving your disease, over and over again, to see how it does best. Runaway killer? Insideous hidden plague? Airborne? Waterborne? you can pick numerous different paths for each disease in how it is transmitted, it's symptoms, and it's abilities. What's best is the variety of different plagues. From simple bacteria, to mutating viruses, to zombie plagues, mind control parasites, and on and on -- great replayablility. The main game is fun enough -- then you realize there are a bunch of scenarios that add even more to the game! A great and unique sim.

This game, while not action-packed, is definitely for those who love strategy. This game has plenty.\n\nDon't be fooled by Casual and Normal difficulties, where it first appears that the strategies are all the same. The real challenge lies in Brutal and Mega Brutal difficulties, where everything you do has a serious consequence. At those difficulty levels, each plague becomes unique, and managing them to beat the cure is no easy task. You really have to plan and think your way through each, and even then random events can derail you. I haven't even gotten to the scenarios yet - can't wait to try them, once I finish all the plagues and unlocking all the genes.\n\nI highly recommend this to the strategy fans everywhere.","June 7, 2014","true","80.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After annihilating the world a few times you start pick up scary facts about the world. Like if a zombie outbreak started in India the world is doomed; Or if a virus mutates to survive in water, then colonizes in England, the world is doomed. Also, have you washed your hands today?

The Developer says "On a serious note – we are still hard at work adding in new content and cool features - the game is stable and polished but not currently feature-complete. Please only buy the game now if you are OK with this and understand that you may also encounter bugs (not the good, world-killing kind...)." and it's 100% accurate.\n\nAmazing game that I can't wait to see in full release.","February 28, 2014","true","34.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Hours invested on the mobile and now looking forward to many more on the desktop.\n\nOverall I love the game, but do have to say I think it's a little over-priced for the content. I'm taking into account what will be in the full release. The scenarios are a nice add, but more plague types would certainly boost the overall value of the game, the marketability, and replay value. I noticed the custom senario feature that's going to be added in with the full version. This is either going to be extremely awesome, and make the game worth every penny of the $15, or it'll be a huge let down.\n\nI highly recommend picking the game up. Either now, if you're feeling anxious like me, or wait until the full release hits so you aren't all antsy for the additional features to unlock. I might also add the summer sale is only a little ways away, and if you're like me you still have plenty of games to play from the winter sale.\n\nI'm glad this made it to PC.

(along with bacteria, which is what you start with to infect the world and wipe out the human race), but this game is a lot deeper than it first appears.  In a way, it's kind of like Risk, in the sense that you essentially need to infect (capture) each state on the map, and then wipe out the humans before they have time and resources to fight back, but the challenge is that unless you do things just right, a well laid plan can backfire pretty easily.\n\nHaving said that, I've already dumped a good 20 hours into the game so far, and it keeps me coming back for more.  You get to know when you've blown it and have to do the game over after a few raounds of play, but eventually you figure out what strategy you need to do to win with the particular plague you are given.  At least partly.  There are enough randome elements thrown in such as unexpected mutations, unexpected actions such as the pesky humans putting filters in aircraft which can hinder your ability to spread.  Getting to the islands of Greenland and New Zealand (among several others) can make or break a game.  If there are ANY humans left alive at the end, you lose, full stop.\n\nBut I would say this game is very well thought out (and appearenly a hit in it's previous mobile form) and even though it's not finished it's one of those games that just keeps yanking you back for more.  Just ONE more try, just one more round, and to me, that's when you are getting your money's worth in a strategy game.\n\nIf you like risk, chess, or any world domination type game, this is definitely one to check out.  One warning, it's not finished yet, so there are still features like custom scenarios coming.  But don't worry, you have to get through multiple plagues to unlock all of them, and then you have to actually beat the game about 10 more times to unlock all of the buffs that you can get for your plagues at the start of each game.\n\nI don't know about anyone else, but I look foward to playing a few rounds each night.  Yes, I have lost sleep over this, and that's a sign of a great game!\n\n","March 16, 2014","true","123.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A wide array of infection options await ranging anywhere from the common virus to prions, bioweapons, fungi, and even some more interesting fictional ones like the undead plague, brain-invading worms, and with the most recent update the Simian Flu from the Planet of the Apes movies.\n\nAdd to the fact of how addictive this game can be and its totally worth the price.","August 7, 2014","true","39.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I managed to infect the entire world without being lethal, then when I went to lethal, the game didn't throw up many DNA points, which are needed to upgrade your virus, so I wasn't able to upgrade the virus with the ability "Genetic Reshuffling 1" which slows down research for a cure, and sets back said research.

That being said, once you reach the neurax worm (Necroa isn't yet available) I found myself VERY much enjoying it, this new one is very interesting and very new.\n\nUnfortunatly, once you have played the neurax one, it's a little harder to go back to the others as they tend to resemble each other a lot, like in the handheld. I think if there were more different types or a deeper gene system it could make the game very interesting.\n\nOverall, I would say the game has a lot of potential, by adding new messages and events to shake things up, a few new plagues that differ like the neurax worm, this could be amazing! There are still a lot of features that aren't implemented since this IS early access, but I'd say if you're interested, 15 dollars isn't quite so bad.

I feel that you can get enough hours out of the game that the price as it stands now is justified. The way the game is now, without the promised multiplayer, already can give you tens of hours of playing time which is really all I can ask for out of a game like this.\n\nAlthough only a few hours in, I find countless reasons why I should get back on the game instead of doing other things. Only having access to one type of disease from the start encourages you to keep playing in order to unlock the others, among other things like obtaining achievements or even just conquering different difficulty levels and testing different strategies gives the game an incredible amount of replay value.\n\nI absolutely dig the simple but sweet design of the game as well. Something about playing on a simple map in HD with good particle effects just is really fun. The menus are very easy to navigate and understand and overall it looks really polished.\n\nSome people claim that this game can be boring in the sense that they claim all you are doing is clicking and waiting, but I disagree. Although this game doesn't require as much attention as some other games that I have played, you clearly make strategic decisions throughout your game in order to go about spreading your disease but at the same time trying to keep a low profile so you are not noticed before spreading the entire globe. You are continuously involved by clicking bubbles that appear on the screen for "DNA points" that you use to go about "leveling up" your disease through different transmission methods, abilities, and symptoms. Lastly, I enjoy reading and reacting to some of the random "news" events which may contribute to my playstyle. For example if bird migration was up, I may consider using my DNA points to make transmission with birds more effective among many other things.\n\nI suppose I can go on all day with this but i'll just finish with saying that I am excited to check out the multiplayer in the future and finally just see how this game turns out when it is officially released.","July 2, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Worth every bit of money!","July 20, 2014","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, if killing off humans is your idea of fun!  It's still early access, so there are a lot of features not yet implemented. As of right now, it's not much more than what you'd get on the phone app. Overall, i'd recommend this game, if only to give into sadistic desires.","August 23, 2014","true","20.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plague Inc. started as a relatively simple phone app. Now it is evolving into a full-flegded pc-game. It has appealing visuals, a ridiculous amount of replay value and can be quite challenging if you wish it to be. Not to mention the (very) regular updates. And let us not forget that it's an early access game, it'll only get bigger and better.\n\nI'd give this game a 9/10 rating, would recommend to my friends.","June 19, 2014","true","39.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
