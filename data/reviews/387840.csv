"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisizeful/recommended/387840/","chrisizeful","chrisizeful","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisizeful/","1137 products in account","Summary:Alpha Runner presents a fun, original concept which includes randomly generated levels, several different character types, mini games, online leader boards and different game modes. The game can be buggy at times. The achievements are extraordinarily easy or 'grindy'. However, the worst thing is that your character is randomly selected for you at the start of each run, instead of you choosing it. In its current state, the game itself is quite fun, it just needs some real achievements, bug fixes, proper options and a character selection menu. I personally think you should wait until it gets out of early access, by then it should be quite a nice and complete game.\nThe Good:    Online Leaderboards.\nFun concept + gameplay. Basically, you jump platform to platform, trying to dodge traps and collect score. The platforms will slowly disappear below you, so you are required to keep moving. There will occasionally be mini games to play.\nRandomly generated. The levels and are randomly generated and have some fun mini games to play in them.\nDifferent characters. There are several different characters with different abilities: Space Jump (higher jump + floating effect), Double Jump, Gotta Go Fast (run faster), and Magnet (attract the score).\nMusic. There is only one short, looped track (for now?), but I find it very entertaining to play to and it sounds quite nice.The Bad:    No resolution options.\nCan't remap controller controls.\nRandom FPS drops. For the most part, this game runs very smoothly. However, it occasionally randomly drops to about 35- 47 FPS and stays there for several minutes. Currently the game is basically unplayable for me because of this.\nNo character selection. At the start of a new run, the game will randomly select your character. It even does this for the speed run mode (which is peculiar since some characters affect speed). Different characters can make the game much, much easier, resulting in higher leader board positions. Having separate leader boards for each of the characters would be nice. Having to kill yourself until you get the character you want is just annoying.\nEasy achievements. Usually achievements are big plus for me in games, however in Alpha Runner they fall into two categories: extremely easy, requires grinding.\nBugs. Including, but not limited to: sometimes when you fall below a platform, you will teleport back onto it (when moving or jumping semi-into it), pausing the game with a controller doesn't properly work.\nOverlapping text. Ever so often there will be some ugly overlapping text, usually at the start of a run.","September 6, 2015","false","4.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","2"

All you do is grab orbs (of sorts) and then the orb moves to the next platform.  The level is one continuous level that never ends.  It's all about seeing how many orbs you can collect while navigating your way through the procedurally created levels.  You are faced with spikes on the floor, circular saws, pounding "boulders" and of course the open space between platforms.  The game, again, is quite simple though it can fulfill that casual gaming itch you may have.  I wouldn't recommend this game if it wasn't for the dev taking my idea.  Originally your character would change, graphically.  However, the gameplay wouldn't change at all.  I offered that he give each graphical character a unique trait, and he took off with it.  Now you randomly get a different graphical character with a specific skill like double jumping, fast movement, etc...\n\nIf anything, get this game to support the dev for being open minded to suggestions and listening to those who play their game.","March 27","true","8.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This makes this game totally random.\n\nTiles that you step on slowly disappear, probably to make the player move his character ever forward (well, at least forward meaning collecting blocks). From time to time you can find a space rocket and start a minigame like Space Invaders where you can shoot about 3-4 UFOs and big UFO for additional points. That would be good unless that minigame wasn't so slow - the rocker starts, it floats up for some seconds and then you can shoot some ufos and then, after shooting a boss ufo, you fall down for some seconds. That is really too long!\n\nThis is clearly a ladder based game, where the only motivation is to beat the high score.\n\nPros:\n- gameplay is really fast, respawning takes about a second\n- characters with special abilities give some fun to the game\n- minimalistic graphics fit the type of the game\n\nCons:\n- boring\n- no point in playing this game other than beating the high-score - no unlockables, no nothing\n- those special characters are picked up randomly thus if you want to have a particular one you need to loose with the character that was chosen randomly until you get what you want\n\nOverall - I don't think that this game is really interesting. Maybe it's not my type of game, maybe it's just boring. You can check it yourself but I would recommend getting it during some Steam Sale.\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","November 4, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have a few different game modes with different dificulties.\n#1 Normal\nNormal mode is an endless mode where you need to collect one point after another while jumping from platform to platform. You need to avoid getting hit by bad stuff and might encounter mini games along the way. Your character is random each round and might come with a bonus (extra speed, less gravity [...] ). You can play as long as you survive.\n#2 Speedrun\nThe goal is to complete the stage as fast as possible while beating a certain # of platforms and avoiding death. Character is random!\n#3 MLG\nBasicly Hard Mode. Same as Normal mode but platforms disappear more quickly and there are some... extras. Character selection is random again.\n#4 Practice Mode\nYou can play as long as you want, nothing counts.\n\nThere music is fitting the game and did not get annoying during my hours of gametime.

This game you run along the same looking platforms and jump over the same 1 type of spike while avoiding the same spinning wheel. This game if you die to restart everything all over. The controls suck, as its just move and jump, nothing else to do. Theres no sprint or anything. As you get further, you get abilities, like double jump, but if you die you lose them, which shouldn't be the case. Every area looks the same as before, as its just rectangles with 1 or 2 spikes. You move slowly, but have to because your jumping is small and slow, and each platform is covered with spikes. Platforms disappear behind you. Also, you will randomly be transported to different areas, like 1 time with me, where i couldn't move, two spinning spikes came at me, I jumped them, then they came back to me and I died and lost all progress, even though I didn't know their pattern or this "mini-game" bc I hadn't seen it before, yet I lose everything because of this. The pause feature doesn't work with the controller, meaning you will restart all progress like me when you try to use it. And that's all there is to the game. Rinse and repeat. I saw everything it had to offer in 5-10 minutes, and was too boring and repetitive.","October 25, 2015","false","6.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

You are given a random character from a selection of about 5 or 7 characters everytime you restart or die and you must dodge saws, clouds and spikes. You must also obviously not fall down and every single platforms break if you stand on them for a few milliseconds/seconds.\n\nIt's very frustating to play, because it's really clunky, your character looks like it is about to fall down then it briefly teleports to the edge of the platform, sometimes you "double jump" on yourself while trying to jump which can get you killed. Sometimes the screen briefly freezes or the game briefly slows down which can you killed too. It's unforgivable to have all of this happen in a game where you start over when you die.\n\nAlso, there's some dumb achievements like just for opening the game and one for dying 1000 times (execpt for the other pointless "rain" grinding achievement, I would be 100% done with the game within 30 minutes.\n\nOverall, there are much better games of this genre out there and I don't think it's worth purchasing. Too buggy and too simple.

It's the type of game where you'll keep dying a lot, but feel determined to actually get better at jumping and progress further just to prove a point to yourself. The music actually helps with the game because it's relaxing in contrast to the fraustration levels this game provides. You jump from platform to platform in a minimalistic style map, and new platforms will generate in front of you as you move ... if you collect the square that makes it.\n\nSo you jump. And jump. And it gets harder and harder and arrgh! The graphics are so basic, though the characters with their small costume changes look funny. Some characters have different abilities, such as jumping higher, falling slower, double jump, attracting blocks from further away, running faster, and so on. So you may end up having a preferred playstyle/character out of it.\nIt's a shame they don't have arms.\nAh well. Better keep running! The game is pretty much as long as you can keep hopping to those platforms for.\n\nPros\n\nSimple but addictive, don't need amazing graphics for a decent, challenging game\n\nGood range of character abilities\n\nRelaxing music\n\nCons\n\nGets boring fast.

It has a great set of different Game Modes and the music really keeps you wanting to play.  I can see this game becoming fairly popular, especially because of the MLG/Speedrun modes.  If you're into Rage type games I suggest trying this game out.\n\nAlso, I was glad I could switch the keyboard controls to other keys.

But all it is: It's unfinished. Normal mode lets jump and run over spikes and sawblades and dodge falling spikes, thats it, there is nothing else to it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumorig/recommended/387840/","kumorig","kumori","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kumorig/","926 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVery, very minimalistic endless platformer. You just jump from platform to platform, avoiding some obstacles. That's about it.\n\nIn normal mode the level spawns randomly in front of you so it's never the same level twice.There is an added risk of going fast since you can't see what's coming ahead of time, it is tempting and somewhat interesting, but there is no reward for going fast. There is also the chance of running into one of two minigames, both of which feels out of place and shoehorned in and adds very little except for maybe breaking your concentration - I think it would have been much better to try to mix up the orignal gameplay.\n\nIn speedrun mode you can see the level in front of you and get to try the same level several times (until you complete it).\n\nEven for a 2d speedrunner this is just too bare bones and minimalistic. I tried chasing some achievments and steam says I spent 0.5 hours and I didn't hate it, but you don't need more than 5 minutes to see everything this game has to offer.\n\nI'll give it that the controls feels very slick and at least it does not have the feel of a mobile port.\n\nBesides the highscore list there is just no content here.
