It might've not been the first of its kind, but it was certainly one of the best. The graphics, inferior compared to today's photorealistic games, were still amazing when it came out.\nYou play as Doctor Gordon Freeman, a scientist working for the mysterious Black Mesa corporation. After discovering an alien planet known as Xen, several experiments are conducted to bring back specimens from this new world. As you come to work one day, everything is normal- except for a test involving a teleportation to Xen, and a suspicious man in a suit warning about unforseen consequences. The team ignores this, and it would cost them nearly everything. The experiment fails, and all hell breaks loose as Xen creatures teleport into the Black Mesa facility, killing anyone and anything. You wake up, during the aftermath of this event. Determined to escape, you fight your way through the facility, all the way to Xen. To find out the rest, you have to play the game. And believe me, every single second of this game is worth it.\n\nGraphics: 19/20\nStory: 18/20\nGameplay: 20/20\nReplayability: 18/20\nSoundtrack: 18/20\nOverall: 93/100, Grade A","November 25, 2013","true","23.4"," 332 of 361 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","332","361","0","27"

See Conclusion\nNOTE 1: Related ContentAlso see my:\nHalf-Life 2 Review\nHalf-Life: Opposing Force Review\nHalf-Life: Blue Shift Review\nBlack Mesa Review\n\nNOTE 2:I review games to help fellow gamers decide whether they should purchase a game or not.  With that said, although I consider Half-Life as a classical MASTERPIECE and possibly one of the greatest games of all time, I will still list down game mechanics from the past that some people may not enjoy today.\n\nThink of it like this: everyone enjoys flying modern-day commercial jets like the 747, but it doesn't mean however that everyone would like to fly in a DC-3 built in the 1940s despite it being labeled as the 'most significant transport aircraft' in history.\n\nINTRODUCTION:Half-Life is a narrative-driven linear first-person shooter (FPS) action game and is the debut (and signature) title of Valve.  Hailed as one of the greatest games of all time winning dozens of awards on release, Half-Life revolutionized the FPS genre in a way that no other title has done since Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake. This game has since been the industry standard on how to make a perfect FPS game which combines realistic gameplay, fun puzzles mechanics, a narrative-driven single-player experience with fast-paced multiplayer action.\n\nThe game follows the story of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist working for the Black Mesa Research Facility that is involved in Weapons Development, Research on Teleportation Technology and occasional cloning of a Security Guard named Barney Calhoun.  When an experiment with an unknown alien crystal results in a catastrophic accident that opened a portal to an alien dimension named 'Xen', Gordon Freeman, wearing the H.E.V. Suit, must now travel across the entire Black Mesa facility to reach the Lambda Complex where he must enter a portal to Xen and kill the creature that is keeping the portal open for the alien invaders. Fight against Invading alien monsters and, at the same time, US Military operatives who are attempting to stop the invasion but is also trying to silence any surviving 'witnesses' of the Black Mesa incident.\n\nLEGACY OF HALF-LIFE (PROS):+ First FPS game to fully incorporate a Narrative-Driven story (as opposed to the industry standard of maze gallery shooters which was the Wolfenstein 3D / Doom mechanic)\n+ Excellent level designs\n+ Realistic combat mechanics (may be not as realistic now in 2015, but 17 years ago it was)\n+ Fun puzzles\n+ Great sound effects\n+ First FPS game to incorporate scripted sequences for its level transitions rather than cut-scenes\n+ Relatively advanced AI (back in 1998), with enemies actively dodging, tactically retreating and often times baiting you into an ambush.\n+ Fun fast-paced multiplayer action that set the foundations for Counter-Strike which started as a mere mod of Half-Life\n+ Mods; although Half-Life is not the first video game to be modded, it is the first to have several such mods become their own full games that still retain their Half-Life heritage\n+ Challenging difficulty modes (but this is a given since most old-school shooters were challenging)\n\nOLD GAME MECHANICS THAT NEW GENERATION OF GAMERS MAY NOT LIKE (CONS):- Perpetual sprint with optional walking by pressing “Shift” (as opposed to today's standard which is the reverse)\n- No objective tracker (players may forget what they were doing especially if they haven't played in a while)\n- Melee weapon needs to be equipped rather than bound to a hotkey (though CS:GO players won't have a problem with this)\n\nCONCLUSION:MASTERPIECE is the only word that best describes Half-Life in my opinion.  Although some of its mechanics may not necessarily be applicable in today's (2015) standard, the same can still be considered as part of its charm, much like how most of us still enjoy watching old-school movies and TV shows.\n\nWORTH IT?:MUST BUY AND MUST HAVE. I, however, do recommend you purchase the Half-Life Anthology if you already have Half-Life 2 but if you don't have it, get Half-Life Complete.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO (Not necessary for the review):The advent of Half-Life was a turning point in gaming history, most notably, the First-person shooter genre.  Before this game, the only FPS standard to be followed was Wolfenstein 3D, Doom and Quake, with the first two being plotless maze shooters and Quake being the first to implement a backstory but still retained the maze-like levels. With Half-Life, developers saw a potential for FPS games to combine intense action and gunplay with effective narrative story-telling through leniar levels (which is heavily abused by some FPS games today) and realistic game mechanics (a title, which most people agree, was held by the Metal Gear Solid franchise, a third-person action game)\n\nLet’s put this in an analogy: Wolfenstein 3D is the Wheel (basically invented the mainstream FPS genre), Doom is the Horse-Drawn Carriage (Doom made FPS games extremely popular, accessible and widespread), Quake is the Steam Engine (Quake bridge the gap between plotless maze shooters and  plot driven FPS games Credit: Steam User RGX12 for pointing this out) and Half-Life is the Ford Model T Car (Half-Life set the standard for modern day FPS games who's basic and essential features still survives today.)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/recommended/70/","bashfulbritishboy","Schmoes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/","121 products in account","What's the first thing that comes to mind, when reviewing a video game? Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it comes as no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave gamers alike wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification. Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS' games of all time. Half-Life isn't literally one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nWhen compared to certain FPS' games in the past and todays time, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to present the main narrative of the game, Half-Life annihilates this often compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For summarization, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.\n\nThe game is a perpetual maze; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Although Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story and easy adaptability.\n\nTo start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.\n\nAs you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Environmental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and the military.\n\nWhile there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again due to some seldom poor AI programming, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus to the magnitude of the game.\n\nFor the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life or even worse, not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a big compulsory  recommendation from me.","August 18, 2014","true","7.7"," 196 of 215 people (91%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","91","196","215","4","0"

Today, I'm speaking about Half-Life, a Valve game which was first released in 1998 and had more than 50 rewards. By most players, this game was considered as a highly atmospheric, greatly built, and amazingly drawn. It also has awesome storyline and multiplayer, so if you don't care about graphics, which were brilliant in 1998, then this game is for you. Complexity of the game levels, hidden secrets, alternate paths, 5 categories of weapons (14 weapons in total), different kinds of friends and enemies will give you as much pleasure as if you got quite a rich man. In my opinion, Half-Life deserves all the rewards it was given, and will stay the best game I've ever played until the end of my days.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernestmurdertrain/recommended/70/","ernestmurdertrain","Ernest Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ernestmurdertrain/","419 products in account","Half-Life is one of the most influential games and many of us have played our fair share of it's modifications like the original Counter-Strike and many more. It surely is an important game and many refer to it as the best game ever made, but Half-Life does have it's flaws as well. I'll start off with the positive.\n\nMost of the games at the time didn't have much depth in the story. Mainly you simply had to run and shoot and the story felt irrelevant, but in Half-Life it was different. The story is quite the usual - an experiment goes wrong and it creates a portal to another planet which allows hostile aliens to go through. Eventhough it seems nothing much, you can always feel that there's more depth put into the story. The pacing is perfect and the world you are playing in is still interesting to look at. The level design is amazing and it does hold up today, even if some of the levels may feel a bit too long. All of the weapons are unique and have use for them. All of them are useful in certain situations. There's also a big variety on how to defeat your enemy.\n\nThe multi-player is still being played today and you'll be able to find servers, but I'd suggest looking up servers on internet, since there's a bigger choice. Multi-player is a fast-paced deathmatch which reaquires a lot of skill and patience. Concept is pretty simple, but actually getting good at it is hard. Maps are well designed and it's still a fun experience, but I'd suggest finishing the story first, because it's where the real beauty of the game is.\n\nSo, there aren't many things to say about Half-Life's flaws. One of the biggest issues is that the soldiers will most likely hit you most of the time, because they are not designed to miss their shots as much. You have to kill them as fast as possible, just so you won't catch as many bullets. On the other hand, other enemies don't do this. Also the levels drag on too much sometimes. Some of the levels feel too long and it might be a little irritating if you are playing the first time. The levels where you have to jump on platforms aren't something I'd like to play through either, but hey, maybe you enjoy that.\n\nOverall, Half-Life still holds up today despite it's age and I can see why people, including me, still play it and it's mods today. If you can't decide whether you should pick Half-Life or Half-Life: Source, I'd say that you should definitely go for the original. The new gun models, textures etc. doesn't make the game feel balanced. It's like your stuck between an old and a new game. Also, Source version does not have as many mods, so go for the original.","August 20, 2015","true","138.9"," 126 of 136 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","126","136","11","3"

is still a gem.I don't vote games by their graphics,but by their gameplay.This was an immersing,wonderful and addicting experience for me.I lived another life.In this game.The game has everything a gamer asks for: Immersing Gameplay,Indulging story,A Nice Selection of Weapons,and graphics that were thrilling in the year it was made,but are all old now.Even now this title holds up till today,shining its glory as the first game that Valve ever made,and a game that changed Gaming itself.Now I will have a look at the main aspects of a good game.\n\nWARNING: A little bit of spoiling ahead.\n\nGameplay: Excellent.Either you are blasting monsters from an alternate dimension or just trying to pick off those squad men who just don't seem to put you in peace.There were a few places where it did get a little bit boring,but that was because I couldn't wait until I would experience something new.The terrain in the game is nicely made,even though it is pretty old due to the date it was made.The places you travel through are pretty different,you won't be bored of seeing the same old place over and over again.The game itself is nicely balanced;except that they could have put less ammo in the game,so you wouldn't always have a gun loaded. 9/10\n\nStory: A nice story is told throughout the game,and that is guaranteed to keep you hooked until the last moment of the game.Even though it doesn't have any cutscenes,it tells its story just wonderfully.It keeps you in first person mode all of the time,so it makes you "live" the character all the way through the story.All the stuff that is happening in the game seems kind of logical,as if could happen in real life.The characters are well done as well,for they act as normal people would act.They are as they should be,they speak,fight,help you and do other stuff.And there is a wierdly acting character which stands out in the game;but I will let you figure that out for yourself.There aren't the same scientists all over and over again,but we can't say this with security guards.The enemies are widely assorted and won't make you think that they are dumb,but play as they are real and trying to get you.No dull moment will get you in this game,so don't be afraid of experiencing any in this game.  10/10\n\nWeapons: There is a wide assort of weapons to fit you in this game,but do not expect too much.There are the main weapons you would except from a game like this,and maybe a little bit more due to an "Monster Invasion" going on all around you.The game has its own signature weapon: A Crowbar.But that is also the only melee weapon that you can use in this game.While you progress through the game you will find weapons,but there aren't many,so every weapon you get,you make use of,because all of them are unique.As I won't spoil much here,I will just tell you that there are weapons from the pistol even to such weapons like a rocket launcher,and a few of alien techologies are found in the game as well.You will find yourself exploring all around you to get some ammo for your favourite weapon,because it gives you tons of ammo for a wide selection of weapons,and the ammo that you need may not be findable anywhere.When you shoot a gun it feels like you shoot a gun,meaning that you will find the gun bouncing back in your hand when you shoot it,and you can hear the sound for gun firing is well done as well.But when shooting a rocket launcher you will not bounce back,but if you move while shooting it the rocket will go wrong and hit another spot,depending on which way you moved.Even if you don't have any ammo,you get to use a alien techonlogy which has unlimited ammo.Even though it recharges over time,it doesn't take much of it and it has special abilities.  8.5/10\n\nEnemies: From the headcrab even to the final boss,the enemies are nicely balanced.You are slowly introduced to each enemy and its tactics,so you know what to use on it and what to do.You probably won't find yourself facing a unnormally big army of enemies if you aren't well armed.Once you learn the tactics the enemies use it is easy to defeat them,just keep a look out for them,or otherwise you might find yourself in quite a pickle.I wouldn't say that the enemies are hard.You can use the terrain to your advantage as well.Luckily,one group of your enemies is fighting another,so you can use that to your advantage as well,if you find the right moment.*wink*.But I wouldn't rely on such stuff,I would just get myself a nice arsenal of weapons and go defeat that crowd of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.There are a few weapons which have unlimited ammo,and I feel that is unbalanced.Don't go prancing around as a pony as well,you will get your ♥♥♥ kicked.There are flying enemies,crawling enemies,walking enemies and big enemies.The crawling ones are easy,just keep a look out for them so they don't get the jump on you.The Flying ones need the right weapons,like a zoom in crossbow,for they fly around and shoot at you and when you get close to them they just fly away.The walking ones are easy enough,just keep a shotgun on your hand and you will be OK.But the big ones need a plan,a strategy and a assault of weapons. 9.5/10\n\nGraphics: From Black Mesa labs to even Alien fields of doom,this game is amazing.It now has its own HD models,so a few things look better when the models are turned "ON".Any computer will be able to get this game running,so why not jump in it already?And as this game was made in 1998,don't expect modern graphics.But that couldn't stop you from playing this game,could it?The terrain is kind of blocky and the characters as well,but if you look past that point get ready to indulge into a game that made gaming as it is today.And the graphics aren't that bad,everything is quite understandable.They have made the graphics the best way they could,and I don't blame them because I don't vote a game by its graphics.And if you can't stand the graphics there is a Source version of the game,made by Valve as well.There is a version made by fans as well,but I wouldn't recommend that because it is modified a bit.But the original is the best in my opinion as it is the completly unmodified version of half life,and the best out there.Of course,that is if you look past the graphics.There are even little details specified in the originl game,but they won't be seen so good and will be kind of blurred.But be sure to keep your eyes lit,for there are many levers,buttons and things like that throughout the game,that blend in with the enviroment. 8.5/10\n\nOverall look: Even though this game is dated,it is definently not dead.Be sure to pick this game up on a sale,or even buy it at its full price,because this game is worth every cent you pay for it.I loved the game,it really got me pulled in and the story was just stunning.I loved every place I came upon to in this game,seeking new adventure and traveling on into the deep unknown.This game is filled with interesting moments and is guaranteed to keep you aroused until the very ending.This is a great classic and everyone should play it,it is an experience not to be missed.It changed gaming as it is now,and was a hit in gaming and it still is.A wonderful game.

As you are walking through the steel corridors to get down to the test chamber all the other scientists keep saying: "They are waiting for you Gordon in the test chamber". After 4 loading screens and alot of waiting on scientists to mock you for being late before letting you progress to the test chamber you at last arrive there to do some testing with crystals from the alien world Xen.\n\nHowever the test goes wrong the very second you push the Xen crystal mounted on a Lawn mower into a beam for testing. This creates the resonance cascade which creates a rift between earth and Xen, allowing Vortigaunts and other alien species to enter earth at will. The Black Mesa security cannot stop the aliens and the army is called in. The army is however not there to help the Black Mesa personnel. They are there to kill everybody invovled with the project.\n\nGordon Freeman must now fight the aliens, fight the soldiers, try to save the scientists that mocked him for being late and with the help of the scientists reach Xen to stop Nihilanth(The Alien mastermind).\n\n\nOverall Half-Life is probably one of those games ive spent the most time playing. Outside of steam that is. Bought it back in 1999 and when steam came along my key was already taken steam said(To verify my key I had to take a photo of my product and its key and send it to valve and back in 2004 that was not an easy thing to do). So I had to play it outside of steam until it ended up on one of those sales. If you have steam and don't have Half-Life then I recomend you buying it as quickly as possible.\n\nHalf-Life is also being remade by a team of dudes. The mod is called Black Mesa. Its avalible for download but it lacks the last levels that were sceduled to be released 2 years ago.\n\nI give Half-Life 10/10 for being a great game and having great replay value.","January 13, 2015","true","6.6"," 83 of 92 people (90%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","90","83","92","18","0"

If you're just looking for a fresh perspective on one of your favorite classics then this review might also be for you. This was the first time I have ever played a Half-Life game. I'm afraid I missed it when it was released, however, I did play similar shooters from that era. I didn't think a review from me would be necessary for such a popular title like Half-Life but seeing that all of the top reviews for it are those ridiculous one or two sentence jokes, I thought that maybe my take on it would be welcome.\n\nIn Half-Life, you fill the shoes of Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who's getting ready for an ordinary day at the office. Gordon Freeman apparently, dons his fancy HEV suit every morning after punching in on the time clock, and then runs around in a room that is not safe anyone not wearing said suit.\n\nLong story short, something bad happens while on the job, and aliens decide to invade Gordon's workplace, Black Mesa labs. You then spend the rest of the game trying to get out of the now compromised Black Mesa facility. The structure is surprisingly large for a research lab and you'll spend quite some time traversing it's different levels, from labyrinthine industrial machinery to the sterile, clean laboratories where Freeman's colleagues go-a-sciencing. Without spoiling too much, the army becomes involved and for some unexplained reason, presumably a cover-up, considers you to be just as dangerous as the invading aliens.\n\nThat pretty much covers it, as far as an overall picture is concerned. You won't start with much, as far as weapons are concerned, however you'll slowly build up your collection as you romp through Black Mesa. The gameplay is smooth and uncluttered with too many bells and whistles. You run, shoot, and jump your way to the surface of the facility. Sometimes, you'll even push and pull some things to solve some very mild puzzles. The game can be quite challenging if you up the difficulty enough. And ammo is at a premium. You really have to think about what weapons you're using against which enemies and what is the most efficient way to kill them. Some weapons are better for killing different targets, which is a nice thing that makes this game more than just a mindless shooter.\n\nThere is little dialogue throughout this game. In fact, there are even a couple of levels where you won't encounter too terribly many enemies, however those are mostly reserved for the more industrial areas of Black Mesa.\n\nThe game is definitely dated, as it runs on the old 1998 GldSrc engine. If you're itching to get your nostalgia on, this can be a good thing, though. It reminded me a lot of Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force from the early 2000's (unsurprisingly, as Raven Software admitted Half-Life was their inspiration for Elite Force). It can also be considered reminiscent of Doom, in it's tone, especially in the later levels I think. If you really just aren't in the mood of '98 graphics, thought, you could always get the Source version of the game, which isn't terribly different, but does give it that extra little oomph you may be looking for.\n\nAll in all, there weren't many cons in this game for me, except for it's lack of exposition. I think that may be more of a sign of it's age, however. Like I said, there isn't much dialogue and if you're looking for a lot of story, you won't really find it in this game. However, I've been told that HL2 has more of that sort of thing. I also mentioned above that ammo can be hard to find and many might consider that to be another negative trait. That's just something that will come down to personal preference, though. At least I never found myself bored while playing. The end boss was pretty unforgiving, though. The technical difficulty of defeating the final boss was fairly frustrating and they didn't exactly make the mechanics of doing it very smooth. This also seems to be a relic from gaming's past, though.\n\nAll things considered, I really enjoyed this game. I came it with mostly a fresh perspective, as I knew little about the tone of Half-Life and I knew little of the story. Even though I never played this as a kid, the nostalgia from shooters of it's era was enough to make me smile from time to time. If you played Quake III or games like it, you might also notice some of the minor similarities. When you consider that this was Valve's debut product, it makes it all seem that much more impressive.","February 9, 2015","true","19.0"," 56 of 57 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","56","57","0","1"

Not fantastic, brilliant, just nice - it's new elements were used in the games coming after, becoming quite common. Half-life's value lies in it's gameplay and it's history, but mostly in it's history.\nI remember playing HL in multiplayer during informatics class around '99-2000, but I couldn't experience the campaign. Though I remember that the lightning-gun, wasp-gun (both alien weapons), and the vast array of weapons, each with alternate fire mode left us all in awe - we played Quake 2 multiplayer before, and HL was a huge step forward.\nLooking back to the game from 2016 (First game I played this year :) )  Half-life is a wild mixture of features that were great, features that could be improved upon and I couldn't really say a negative, besides the clunky bossfight.\n\nThe graphics aged quite well - as there are no cutscenes, you don't really need to check characters from up close to notice the bad lipsync. (Not to mention that Black Mesa apparently uses clone guards and a few cloned scientists, they are so alike :P ) - but for example the zombie of HL1 in my opinion is much, much creepier than HL2's if we compare their looks.\nThe sounds are great - footsteps can be heard and sound different on various materials. Also the 3D-sounds work incredibly well - with headphones you can pinpoint enemies by their sounds really accurately, and/or reacting fast for an incoming attack.\nWeapon diversity is huge, and while I wanted to use the MP5 for the whole game, I was quite content to see that once there were no marines present who used the machine gun, I could find no more ammo for it - good point for story and world integrity.\nAaand speaking about the story - this is the point what I disliked about the game. I don't want to mention spoilers (Are there spoilers for a 18 year old game?) but the story basically consists of people telling you in A to go to B, and either you can directly go to B, or have to turn on/off some valves, doors, gates, enery to continue to B.  Many people says that this game is mysterious but that's only true because there is no world-building - you're Gordon Freeman, everyone's pawn and courier who runs forward, because he was told to do so, while the world is basically a corridor around you.  Not like it's a problem - afterall, game is from '98. While the story itself sounds really intresting if one's reading it, experience-wise basically I was shooting at everyone who wasn't wearing blue/labcoat and going forward... Maybe because of the constant first person gameplay (absolutely no cutscenes) I felt more like things there are just blocking me and are annoying than they were actually part of the story.\nAnd to balance this, the story's parts I liked - mostly mechanics and ideas.\n- The tentacle monster was a fantastic idea - disract with granades and sneak.\n- I liked how the environment could change - like an airstrike near causes the window to shatter, opening a way to go instead of it being openable, or just straight-out open.\n- Difficulty level changes more than damage and hp - enemy behaviour and attack patterns also change (to hell with Bethesda's harder -> bulletsponge difficulty scaling)\nAfter finishing the game (LOTS of idling involved, both because chat and leaving computer) to be honest I don't feel like I played a legend. It was a good game that would have been absolutely fantastic if I play it ~15 years ago, but still holds up remarkably well, and posing more challenge on normal than Bioshock Infinite in 1999 mode (hardest) . Games definitely got easier. But it was good to see the game from start to it's end, and finally, it made me much more intrested in HL2 as I was :)","January 3","true","29.1"," 55 of 64 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","55","64","3","2"

It's excellently paced and extremely varied, full to the brim of memorable and only occasionally frustrating encounters (looking at you, machine gun bunkers). While some of the weapons get a bit gimmicky, especially towards the end, unlike Opposing Force or HL2 they're never shoved in your face as the hot new thing, just dropped in your path to play with if you like.\n\nThe final trip to Xen at the end of the game apparently has a reputation of being disappointing, but personally I didn't mind it at all, and the healing chambers were a welcome relief from limited resources pitted against two different armies. My main issue with Xen is at that point the game had been going on for about 12 hours and I just wanted it to end already.\n\nOther than length, the biggest weakness of Half-Life is probably its plot, in that for most of the middle section there isn't one. The game starts off with a nice slow boil, giving you a brief tour of Black Mesa before everything promptly goes to hell, building up from a survival horror feel against incoming aliens before gradually ramping up into an action game as the HECU marines go from merely killing everything and everyone in sight to targetting you specifically due to your stubborn refusal to die. By that point what little the plot has to say patters out until the third act, and all you're left with is an endless series of action and platforming sequences with no context besides "this is the way forward." They're not BORING, I must emphasize. It's just that they keep coming as Gordon Freeman consistantly fails to find the exit.\n\nIf this seems like a mostly negative review, I'm rather critical by nature and it mostly stems from my feelings after finishing the game. As I said, its two chief issues are exhausting length and lacking motivation besides "move forward and don't die." From a purely gameplay standpoint the game is brilliant, full of sprawling setpieces which are linear enough to avoid getting lost but nonlinear enough to give you plenty of corners to explore for loot, and for as long as it is, it's a miracle it never felt repetitive.\n\nWhile I think Blue Shift is an all-around tighter package, Half-Life has absolutely earned its place as a cornerstone of gaming history.","October 25, 2014","true","15.8"," 51 of 59 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","51","59","4","0"

Half-Life sits in a chair in a vast and golden hall along with only the highlords of the first-person-shooting genre. There we can find the likes of DooM, Wolfenstein, Quake, Unreal, BioShock, GoldenEye, Battlefield 2... Yes, Half-Life is that noble.\n\nGordon Freeman is a physicist gone survivor/gunslinger in chaotic circumstances surrounding the accidental opening of a dimensional portal that brought about alien hostile presence into the Black Mesa Research Facility. The tension can be felt through every sensorial fibre of the narrative, from the stable low-pitch melodies of the soundtrack to the sudden appearances of creatures throughout the many corridors and laboratories found in the maps. The level design is extraordinary, and intelligent in progressively revealing the labyrinthine network of tunnels and ducts that hide vital items for the adequate fast-paced action of a quintessential shooter. However, such a network also provides the player with the strategic edge to approach danger and conflict, something innovative in itself for a genre that is - usually - sadly stigmatised by the shortcomings of linearity.\n\nIts daring features are a testament to the prime product of an age that it was. Half-Life subtly overcomes limitations of its time: it pioneered non-cutscene dynamic action and continuous immersive narrative, allowing the player to actually be part of everything s/he watches from behind the screen. Gordon may never be seen or heard in the de facto game, but the initial display of routine in Black Mesa (the famous tram sequence) drowns the player in unsullied immersion, not presenting any perspective bias or character automation. Gordon Freeman is as "free" a protagonist as it gets in a game of this kind.\n\nBe it for the strategic patience necessary to solve its puzzles, or for its compelling themes of cosmic conflict and the possible rough edges of scientific discovery, one shall find satisfaction in Half-Life. The dozens of Vortigaunts, Headcrabs, and Alien Grunts are there to remind the player that different kinds of shooting and approaching are necessary in order to survive both Black Mesa and Xen. How far into the dimensions of suspense and cunning one can get - is up to the player's willingness to brave this gaming gemstone from the late 1990s.","December 24, 2014","true","18.7"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","41","46","3","4"

In fact all other first person shooters and games in general can learn from Half Life 1. The game world is extremely immersive. There are no level ends, there is no text to read, there are no scores and everyone talks to you without freezing you into a cut scene. All of this makes you feel less like you are a player playing a game, but you are indeed the hero Gordon Freeman. Characters recognize you, talk to you, and you can have them come with you or stay put. Security guards that come with you will shoot enemies (slowly).\n\nThe story is that you are silent protagonist Gordon Freeman (you'll feel like him by the end) and you work for Black Mesa, your standard super secret facility. Something goes horribly wrong and uh. The formula is very simple, but they execute it so well that other games have copied it and failed (Doom 3). Needless to say you need to fight your way out through the facility, on the desert (being chased by a helicopter), and everything else would just be a spoiler. There are no levels, no loading screens. Loading is seamless and happens during downtime.\n\nHalf Life 1 has simple controls and an optional tutorial level. There are buttons for jumping, crouching (sneaking), using your flashlight (that needs to be off to charge it), shooting, secondary shooting (for machine guns) and "using" things. The game is always in run mode and character speed seems to be fast. Too fast sometimes, but there is that sneak button that will slow you down.\n\nBut how is the first person shooting? There is a wide variety of guns and each has a certain joy and usefulness to them. Even the simple pistol is useful for lesser enemies 8 hours into the game. There is a shotgun, a machine gun with grenade launcher, grenades, explosives you detonate, wall sensors with explosives, a harpoon, a laser guided rocket launcher that once it launches you point your cursor and it will turn accordingly, lasers, homing missiles, head crabs and more. An amazing array that you continue to get even up to the final levels areas. To swap weapons you push 6 number keys and press some keys twice to access some weapons like the shotgun / machine gun / harpoon.\n\nYou start with a crowbar good for breaking grates, and destroying boxes. Destroying boxes is how you will find most items and ammo. Instead of just finding things scattered on the floor, on shelves or on a desk you need to bash open boxes to find the good stuff. You can also push or pull the boxes too which is nice for puzzle solving and platforming.\n\nThe enemies are just as diverse and each one requires you to think and act differently. Since I don't know the name of any enemy I'll fumble through this. The start enemies are lesser creatures that will start on the floor and jump at you. 2 shots from a pistol take them out. There are zombie-ish aliens that take a shotgun or two, but they are easy enough to avoid. Aliens that teleport in and beam electricity at you will cause you to hide, pudgy little alien crawler / hoppers will make you shoot from a distance because they will send out a small shockwave. Standard soldiers that will shoot machine guns, throw grenades and coordinate attacks against you like flanking. Ceiling huggers that are yucky red globs on the ceiling with long rope like tongues that when they catch you, you'll be pulled up and eaten... if you don't shoot them. Giant aliens with homing missiles too. There is a wide variety of enemies and bosses. I can't list them all.\n\nThe game also shines with its tricks and traps and will throw a puzzle or challenge at you to keep you thinking. But in this game it doesn't feel like a puzzle or a challenge. It seems natural. There can be a hidden turret where the fun is making your choice how to take it out... Grenade, explosive, shooting it and getting shot in the process, running by it or just not hitting the trip wire to start it in general. Wall sensor explosives, push and pull box puzzles, pushing buttons, hopping hanging boxes over a pit, conveyer belts, using a sky cannon to destroy walls, using turrets, on rails vehicles that you have a lot of control over, water puzzles, high jump pads and so on. There is a lot of variety and it's never the same thing twice.\n\nTo sum it up, this is a diverse and VERY FUN game. It has a sense of humor to it and you'll feel like you are Gordon Freeman through the game's well crafted immersion. Puzzles, shooting and challenges all melded together into one fantastic game and I can't say that too often.","August 12, 2012","true","29.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","0"

It's undoubtedly a great game. It's different from everything I've ever played. I decided to play it on medium difficulty because why not? I am used to playing shooters after all. Hell, it was so frustrating, sometimes. Not because the enemies would be that hard to kill, they were not, but because I got lost and didn't know how to continue and while I was going through all the rooms again to find my way out, I fell down here, lost a bit health there and after some time I couldn't continue without loading an older save to try to play that part again and to be more careful this time.\n\nIn chapter 6, Blast Pit, I totally lost clue about what to do next. I was struggling to motivate myself to keep playing. But then I found those amazing walkthrough videos made by BigMacDavis and he and his love for Half-Life made me want to continue. I really have to recommended them because it helps you, it's fun and very nice to listen to.\n\nAfter chapter 6 I started to love the game more and more. I got several new weapons, also unique ones, which were fun to use and very effective. The use of different weapons for different enemies was very satisfying. Valve did a really good job there.\n\nIf you like sci-fi and shooters and don't care about nicest graphics. If you want action without too many dialogues and if you don't get easily frustrated. Or if you just want to know why this game is so popular, give it a chance. It's worth of it!","July 23, 2015","true","24.1"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","13","14","3","13"

The game offers a great mix of puzzle solving and action.\n\n+ The game has a variety of different weapons to fit the situation at hand as well as your playstyle\n\n+ For an old game the AI is surprisingly pretty good, granted it does get stupid sometimes but that is forgivable\n\n+ I love the sound effects in the game. To me the music and sound effects are a big part of the Half Life experience.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-20% of the level design is bad, sometimes its hard to figure out where to go and some of it just doesn't make a whole lot\nof sense.\n\n-the last few chapters of the game are awful.\n\n- I experienced numerous glitches in the game\n\nConclusions\n\nHalf LIfe is the father of modern FPS. Back when it was released I would have given it a 9/10 but the game for all its\nstrengths is starting to show its age. However given its age it still holds up better than most games and being a FPS that\nmeans something. This game really should be experienced by everyone to see how modern FPS games came to be.\n","November 6, 2014","true","6.8"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","24","34","2","0"

The few downsides are that you need to really look for your objectives. The really tiny button, switch or hole are easy to miss. Had to look up walkthrought a few good times (good old games eh? :D). The difficulty is more like: easy - easy , normal - hard, hard - just ragequit. And lastly the AI can be a bit weird and unco-operative and the enemies seem to be so mlg that they never really miss. Don't really think there are other downsides. Oh yeah the music was really great, whenever it played! It's really good for it's time! A classic.\n\nMight even buy the DLCs on the next sale.

I remember playing the demo, Half-Life: Uplink and going crazy for it. So, what did I think of the full game?\n\nIt blew my F**KING mind! Mere words are insufficient to describe how freaking AWESOME this game was (and still is). I shall however attempt to do just that.\nThe story is excellent. You begin as Gordon Freeman, a scientist in a secret laboratory complex called Black Mesa. The suspense builds as you make your way to the test labs and then, once there, it all goes horribly wrong. Your world is thrown upside down. Black Mesa has suffered a catastrophic system failure. Your friends and colleagues are dead or dying. It seems you are trapped far underground. But worse is yet to come.\n\nCombat is good and fun seeing enemies gibbed by your explosives. There is a lot to explore. The facility is vast, although not every door can be opened. Music is good and fits into the location of Black Mesa and the level you are on. Enemies are varied and vary in ability. Each section/level has its own theme and look, along with its own challenges.\n\nHalf-Life was helped back in the day by the hundreds of mods that gamers made, enhancing and extending the Black Mesa complex. With them, the game seemed to last forever, which is no bad thing.\nThe game comes with multiplayer and I must say was an absolute delight to be involved in. I spent many hours with my friends competing and having much fun in the process. I actually became rather good at it, if I do say so myself.\n\nAfter over 15 years the graphics obviously shows its age but in all honesty, who cares? I don't. It's actually one of the reasons I love the game and have such fond memories of it. Most of the character models look and sound the same, so making out who is who is almost impossible, which shows in the sequel.\n\nThere may be Half-Life II and Black Mesa, which are graphically superior but if not already done so, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you play this game. You shall not be disappointed.\n\n10/10 (for its time)\n","November 13, 2015","true","0.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

Sure, the graphics may be questionable to some by todays standards, but for it's time they were groundbreaking. A vast selection of weapons, areas, an amazing storyline and puzzles make this one really brilliant single-player experience. The Hazard course by extension is also the most well implemented tutorial I've seen in a game.\n\nThis is a game that I could play for many more years to come and still enjoy it by setting myself challenges. The only thing that would improve upon Half-Life (and Opposing Force, even Blue Shift) would be to create a list of acheivements just so there is some extra singleplayer playability, but other than that, there is nothing out there in the FPS world that even comes close to matching Half-Life, and I doubt that there ever will be.\n\nValve are amazing story tellers, this is evident in essentially every title that they release with the exception of one or two more silly games and I (like everybody else) eagerly await the upcoming Half-Life titles. It is torture to make somebody wait so long for something so promising.\n\nTo cut a review short, this game is amazing and it always will be.

It was revolutionary in its day - November 1998, to be precise - for its (somewhat) realistic combat and overall approach to its narrative. There were no cutscenes or voiceovers for the main character. You were put into the shoes of Gordon Freeman, PhD. That made the game all the more immersive and involving, and it is indeed both.\n\n\nThe plot itself is still very good and elegantly presented, if not entirely as gripping nowadays where half-realistic aliens and gundudes are more prevalent in gaming. The first section of the game involves you commuting to work in a labryinthine government research facility; the presentation and interactivity present during your commute (and preparation for the workday) make it work quite well, and it's still believable.\n\nThen you do a big experiment and everything goes to Hell in a handbasket. Hostile aliens are teleporting in from the alternate dimension your employers were foolish enough to screw around with, and you have to fight your way out of the laboratories with a scant few weapons at first. Things only get worse from there.\n\n\nThis is primarily a first-person shooter, and the gunplay is good if a bit repetitive. You eventually carry a whole armory's worth of guns, from an MP5 to a rocket launcher to guns that shoot tau and gluon particles (creative license; I'm pretty sure tau and gluon particles can't actually explode people) to an alien bio-gun that shoots angry bees. The graphics...were probably great back when it was released, and while they still seem timeless to me they haven't aged quite as gracefully as Half-Life 2's graphics.\n\nThere's also a fair bit of puzzling to be had; mostly moving objects around, jumping puzzles and finding the right switch in an area. They're not terribly hard, but they intersperse very nicely with the shooting. Since this game is partially based off the Quake engine, your character moves rather fast by default, which is something to keep in mind.\n\nThe AI was unprecedented in its day, but not quite as stellar now. They can still put up a good fight though, and the game can become very intense if you're not careful. The music is excellent; a fitting mix of unsettling ambient electronica and rock.\n\nThe last part of the game I will not spoil as much as others might, but it involves a fairly larger amount of jumping puzzles than the rest of the game, as well as some...interestingly designed levels. It's not exactly bad, but it's definitely a change from the rest of the game that you may not be entirely comfortable with. Which is perhaps what Valve was going for...\n\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the multiplayer deathmatch is still around and pretty good, if rather fast-paced. Haven't played much of it, unfortunately. This game also spawned what is perhaps the biggest mod base in video gaming history. Multiple multiplayer mods for this game became separate commercial releases sanctioned (and usually developed in part by) Valve themselves, such as Counter-Strike and Team Fortress. Not to mention the number of custom simgle-player campaigns, some of which I should probably review later.\n\n\nOverall, I would recommend this as a piece of history, a classic and as a good game even after all these years. Mostly. If you want classic Half-Life with the Source engine, you could try Half-Life Source, or if you want a modernized version you could try Black Mesa. There were also two expansions by Gearbox Software, Opposing Force and Blue Shift, and I'd recommend them if you liked classic Half-Life. Sven Coop is also free on Steam for co-op adventures in the original Half-Life engine, and it even comes with a complimentary copy of the HL campaign.","May 6, 2011","true","7.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","4"

That same company later released Doom, and for quite a while most shooters were simply tagged as Doom Clones. Games like Quake, Duke Nukem, Shadow Warrior, Star Wars Dark Forces, Unreal were among them. Then in 1998 Valve released Half-Life and revolutionized the way FPS games were played.\n\nGameplay\nYou see, games from the Doom era focused on you trying to avoid the incoming missiles that enemies shoot at you. They focused on your mobility. They also would usually have secret places where you can get better weapons and more ammunition. Exploration was the key in old school games.\nHalf Life on other hand played differently from ealier FPS games. It focused on your trying to stay behind cover and watch your recoil when shooting. Sounds familiar right? Yes, Half Life was the game that gave us the foundation for all of today's FPS.\nHalf Life did feature elements that force you to use doom's tactics. Mostly when encountering aliens. Headcrabs for example would jump at you. Vortigons would shot a green beam. There are some that that spit corrosive fluid. And big giants that shot small missiles that follow it's target. When encountering soldiers on other hand, it will play like today's shooter. Still, there is a fair amount of both in the game.\nThe game also borrowed elements from survival horror. You are mostly always out of ammo. So use them well. And it rewards you for exploration.\nFinally, it features a lot of puzzle solving and platforming, which is a bit unusual for an FPS\n\nStory\nBack in the days, there was no story in FPS games. And even if there was, it would be delivered via cutscenes. Well, Half Life changed that. They had friendly npc, which you could interact with. They had those cinematic set pieces - big explotions, rocket launching into space etc.\nHalf Life story may not be unique, basically it was about a corporation named Black Mesa, researching the portal technology, while accidentaly opening a portal to another planet named Xen which leads to an invasion.\nIt's about how they deliver it that makes it so special. No one has ever done that. They were the first.\n\nGraphics\nIt may not look like it, but back then it was amazing. The game didn't even come to PS1 simply because it couldn't handle it (despite being released in 1998). Valve used GldSrc, which was based on Quake's engine.\n\nI guess the only bad thing i can say about the game are the sounds. Don't play this with your headphones.\n\nThis game consists of 18 Chapters and an Epilogue, giving you 2 choices. It's fairly long, ~15 hrs.\n\nAnd it also gave birth to games like Counter Strike, thanks to the mods.\n\nYou should try this out, at least to show respect to the FPS genre. There is a source remake for this game called Black Mesa, but it's not finished (missing last 4 levels of the game)","November 17, 2013","true","15.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

No matter if you are a console gamer or just got into gaming and know nothing about the games out there, everyone has heard of or seen somewhere something about Half-Life. This is no wonder, released in 1998 and a true legend in the videogames history for being not only the turning point in Valve's fame and expansion towards creating Steam, developing the mighty Source engine and all other magnificent games they've made over the years, but also for being a thrilling FPS adventure which still fascinates gamers 17 years after the official release.\n\nThe game manages to completely merge you with the character you are guiding, Gordon Freeman, through the massive Black Mesa venue. You are directly introduced into the action, no overwhelming storytelling, cutscenes or anything like that. By doing this, you get the complete feeling of being where Gordon is, without being rejected from the action as a mere spectator. The story is not at all overloaded with thousdands of plot twists to try to keep the action on. You are given a objective at points and you have to get through loads and loads of unexpected events on the way to your "checkpoint". That makes the gameplay action packed and, most importantly, dynamic.\n\nProbably the most impressive thing of the entire game is the incredibly imaginative and complex world in which the game goes on. It is huge (and I think that the word huge is too weak to describe its actual size) and, again, complex as hell. Your main struggle will in all likely be to find the way to the next stage as entrances are well hidden and nearly all of them require you to do something to open it. And yes, you'll need to use your imagination to figure out how to pass through an obstacle or open a locked door. The possible obstacles and their respective ways to overcome them are countless. The game also invites you to explore secret areas in which there may be utilities like weapons, ammo or a warmly welcomed health kit. All in all, the entire game will take around 20 hours to complete entirely.\n\nIf I described the enemies you'll find through the game, I'd be spoiling the gameplay. Every enemy has his meaning to the storyline, ones more related than others, but generally it's not a bunch of NPCs randomly spawned here and there that you have to kill. As you go past the chapters, the enemies will change. Weapons and armor utilities are also fully connected to the stage you're at and are all completely different. You have three kinds of weapons: fire weapons, experimental weapons (Black Mesa is a research venue) and alien weapons (bit of a spoiler there, so be careful!). The stages through the game will take you to differently ambiented places in which you'll get the respective kind of weapon.\n\nOverall, there's not much more to say about this game. I could write the typical pros and cons summary at the end of the review, but it is hard to do. All I can say is that this is a must-have. It's a masterpiece of videogames. No other game, whatever the better graphics and all the new-gen stuff will be as good as this game is unless it pays the same attention to detail, imagination and creativity.\n\n10+/10","August 5, 2015","true","20.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

This game represents the downfall of EA, who had brought in the past relatively ok RPGs such as Glover, Alladin, and Space Channel 5: Part 2. Half-Life is the bottom line. Everyone should play this game, if only to steer clear of accidentally doing something that this game did if they plan on developing a game. There is no redeemable quality to be had here.\n\n9/10","June 29, 2015","true","4.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","8","10","5","2"

Today is once too often though and his employer is non too happy about his lack of time keeping.\n\nUpon his late arrival, Mr.Freeman (or as his friends call him, Chungus) finds himself in a bit of a pickle when he finds himself sent to the 'punishment chamber' to think about his inability to get to work on time. Unknown to his employers, Chungus is suffering from a midlife crisis and his recent inprisonment is all that is needed to push this mild mannered telemarketing assistant over the edge.\n\nAs we see witness the hearthwrenching sight of a man slowly losing his grip on reality, Chungus stands up with his hands to the heavens screaming "What do you mean I can't get to work on time!?!". Picking up his crowbar friend, he breaks out of his prison with only one objective on his mind, to remind his boss why people don't like Mondays.\n\nTravel through photorealistic office enviroments as you make your way through endless hoards of enemies to reach your destination at the top of Black Mesa Office Supplies LTD. Evade medical officials as they try to help you with your diminishing grip on reality, plow through the lair of the Human Resourses department, dismember the legions of terrifying un-undead, take control of any piece of office equipment that could arguably be classed as a vehicle.\nLive through the sadness, the laughter, the action, the romance in this thrilling conclusion to the Half-Live quadrilogy as you fight for the promotion you deserve in this dog eat dog telemarketing adventure through the eyes of a man suffering from schizophrenia, hallucinations, drug withdrawal and a deep clinical depression from the loss of his pet Turtle, 'Simon'.\n\n"Not many things give me an erection these days but Mr.Freeman has such a supple pair of buttocks and ample breasts that no man could resist his charming personality."\n* Gavichael Ramsey Jr - RT Magazine *\n\n"The game wouldn't close and task manager wouldn't open, so I didn't really have much choice in playing this"\n* Papa Het - Construction Worker *\n\n"Well yea, I guess it technically is a game"\n* Barry *\n\n\n10/10 Would be late for work again.","June 5, 2014","true","1.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","1"

I guarantee.\nAlternatively, if you're a fighting gamer into Blazblue, Guilty Gear, Street Fighter, Injustice, this game may be for you as well.\n\nAlthough, the only con of this game is the quality of the graphics which runs on OpenGL gfx, and it's not surprising beacuse this game was made in 1998. But that is not to undermine the overall quality of the game. This is one of the most very fast-paced games I've played; It's faster than Unreal3 and is more flexible than Unreal3 as well as Quake. It has a reasonable weapon switching duration. The cool thing is once you're you become an elite player (in no time depending on how dedicated and competitive you are) you will learn to bind all your useful weapons to keys rather than having to scroll your mouse to the wep you want or use number slots; this enhance your speed, reaction time, and reflexes.\n\nFor example, let's say you do a cool stunt: You fling yourself or launch yourself with a "Tau gun" and you fly in midair at 50 mph (kinda like Attack on Titans Maneuver gear, seriously) then you use a crossbow and quickscope an enemy, and he dies instantly (just like how you kill a Titan, but even cooler). Then you you charge your Tau gun again and you launch yourself to an enemy and kill him with a shotgun... BAMB! Good Fight.\n\nThis is my favorite game of all time, and the game is too awesome for me to explain in depths. You gotta really play it to unraveal that wonderful fantasy of yours :)\n","June 22, 2014","true","106.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/70/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Half Life is a First Person Shooter that takes place in a hidden laboratory that experiments with teleportation. As you can guess things quickly go wrong and our protagonist Gordon Freeman must fight to survive. Gordon is an engineer but he is proficient with firearms and has no qualms about killing. He is a generic mute character with no personality and very little back-story. As is pretty much everyone you meet throughout this adventure. There are only three character models of scientists and one character model of the security guard rehashed throughout the game. It quickly makes you stop caring if they survive an encounter since you will surely meet the same exact guy again. I know it is from 1998 but it would have been better to make those three scientist models count and have actual characters in the game instead of meeting an endless clone of scientists throughout.\n\nThe story is told during gameplay and there are no cutscenes which is nice. If you don't care about story you can just as easily whack the character talking instead of listening to them. There is no consequence for killing allies but sometimes they do lead to some extra loot or simply help you fight off aliens. It feels like a grand adventure since all the missions are seamless and connect together perfectly. Most of the areas early on are bland and gray but it is impressive how much variety there is in the actual objectives to get through them. It is never as simple as running and gunning, if something can go wrong it always does for poor Gordon.\n\nWhich leads to my main problem with the game. The amount of platforming is kind of ridiculous and it  feels pretty awkward. They also demand too much precision as well as that annoying need to crouch jump to reach just a tiny bit higher so you can jump over certain objects. Another similar problem is that ladders are extremely unreliable and you never know if Gordon will hold on to it causing you to have to try over and over again. Luckily missing it is very rarely fatal although trying to go down one can be fatal as Gordon decides he has no need for ladders and that he can land a 30 ft fall. Quick saving is a godsend and makes these situations much more tolerable. The puzzles are never too complicated though the game can be inconsistent at times such as certain identical objects are not destructible but suddenly one is. Or just plain odd like them expecting you to figure out you can change tracks by shooting a sign during the railcart level.\n\nActual gameplay fairs a lot better. You start off with a crowbar and quickly get a pistol which I used throughout the whole game since it has decent damage and is very accurate.  Most of the weapons are pretty standard like an assault rifle, shotgun and revolver but there are some pretty unique weapons late game. Some do share certain types of ammo like the assault rifle and the pistol. The assault rifle and shotgun are pretty inaccurate which makes sense considering Gordon is an engineer.  Gordon's main source of survival is some kind of special suit that takes the impact out of most damage and allows navigation through toxic hazards. For a while at least, Gordon does not wear a helmet for some reason and the toxicity will kill him eventually. The suit works pretty much the same as armor from any other FPS of the time and can be recharged by finding small glowing vials or through a wall mounted H.E.V center. The same goes for health, both first aid kits laying around and wall mounted health centers will heal you.\n\nEnemies in this game each have their own unique attack patterns and have pretty good AI. Most of the time humans will be your greatest foe since bullets are way too fast to dodge in this and they pull off impressive maneuvers at times such as when you chase them they drop a grenade behind them allowing them to regroup. The security guards yo can have follow you around are completely useless on the other hand. Most of the times they don't react until they get struck first and are only useful to distract the enemies. The game does steadily introduce new powerful enemies but you will be fighting mostly the same group of enemies from beginning to end. Aliens do look very weird and are not simply just humanoid enemies. Some enemies have weird death animations that play whenever they are dying so make sure to recognize them and not waste any ammo even though they are still moving.\n\nOverall Half Life is a pretty good game but don't let all the praise make you expect something amazing. There is no gripping story here nor is there even any characters aside from one mysterious man. Platforming in a FPS very rarely works and it sure as heck doesn't here. Still it is a solid title when it is not trying to be an Adventure game instead of a FPS. Half Life continue to be supported after all these years so it features modern controls and modern resolutions which is always nice. The physics like boxes floating on water and some puzzles solved by it are pretty fun to watch and neat. This is definitely a thinking mans shooter, you will be fighting your surroundings as much as shooting guns. If you can stomach all the forced platforming and want more in your FPS than shooting hordes of bad guys this is the game for you.","May 7, 2015","true","16.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

The atmosphere changes a-lot from time to time, bone-chilling, heart-wrenching, or just plain intense!You've got two enemies hopping onto your back in this game, The HECU & Xen, think about that.

There is also one giant mystery to this whole series, and that is - The G-Man, nothing is really known about this character, not even till this day!

Keep in mind that there are other games with steady game-play that came out in 1998, but this is Half-Life we're talking about! A wide variety of arsenal, Smg, Shotgun, Pistol, RPG, who CAN'T love that? I do admit, some of the physics are a bit off, such as sliding a box or jumping onto a box that has physics, it could throw you off! This game features moments where you could be caught or not, such as a helicopter flying over you while you're in a sewer tunnel, you could shoot & trigger enemies early or sneak past - It's the players choice and how they want to see the story as.\n\nVoice Acting:\nLet's be honest, most games around this time didn't have amazing voice acting, but I would give the Voice Acting in Half-Life 1 a pass. All the scientists sound the same, along with the security guards. But I could see why they'd re-use the same voice actor, budget-wise, etc. No further analysis needed for this section!\n\nSoundtrack:\nOh boy, the soundtrack is very intense! Every track played during sequences definitely fit the tone of that particular scenery/scene! One of my favorites is "Drums and Riffs".

This includes all of the DLC for the original Half-Life, which I am currently reviewing.\n\nOverview Half-Life is a monumental achievement in the world of PC gaming. I say this as a 15 year old male who has just now played it nearly 2 decades after its release, which was back in November 1998. This game is just over 2 years older than me! It is also still perfect in nearly every way, from its base gameplay on up to the expertly crafted story of tense mystery. In this review I will go over the graphics/performance, gameplay, and narrative of Half-Life, along with some closing thoughts.\n\nGraphics/Performance Look, I'm not going to try to pull anyone’s leg here. By modern standards, Half-Life is not much of a pleasure to look at. Yet still, there is something unique and special about its design that makes it look impressive, even now. I think it’s the tightness and lack of visual hiccups that really pulls the game into the modern age without too much of a fuss. Another likely reason for this are the modern widescreen resolutions it offers, something almost no games were doing back then. In short, the aesthetics are timeless as long as you aren't a total graphics ♥♥♥♥♥. Now on with the performance; it's near perfection. I am running on Windows 10 with no PC components older than 2012, and it runs flawlessly. I don't know what it is about the Goldsource engine (and newer Source engine for that matter) but everything runs without nearly a single discrepancy. I think I ran into 2 frame drops the entire 10-12 hours Half-Life spans, and one bug, which was how easily you could get stuck on the games environments. Very slight grievances, I know. All in all, Half-Life is utterly unfailing both graphically and performance wise.\n\nGameplay This is where the real meat of Half-Life is. The action is visceral, the mechanics are flawless, and it all comes together into a challenging and highly varied orchestra of gameplay splendor. I really can't stress enough how amazing the gameplay is. The combat is fast paced and packed with copious amounts of weapons for you to use against your foes, whether they are the multitudes of Xen monsters, or Gordon's many confrontations with military force. There is also some platforming and simple puzzling to do, which are all executed perfectly. My only qualms with Half-Life on the gameplay side are the somewhat basic goals the game will often give you, and also its level layout on rare occasion. You are constantly tasked with pulling levers, pushing buttons, and turning wheels in order to progress or overcome larger enemies in Half-Life. It wouldn't be too much of a problem if these tactics weren't used to defeat nearly every boss in the game, but I digress. Some explanation for my complaints on the level design; it is normally great, but does get a bit nonsensical at times. It may just be my lack of knowledge on the layout of games in the late 90's/early 2000's, but I got lost every now and then and would then have to use a guide to solve this issue. It wasn't common, but it was a nuisance when it occurred. All this considered, when you look at the big picture, Half-Life's gameplay wraps up into one tight and astounding experience that was far ahead of its time, with only a few moments of tedium or confusion.\n\nNarrative As far as storytelling goes, Half-Life is a total enigma. It's really hard to pin very much down when you get deep into the game, but I'll give a quick, spoiler free analysis. To sum up, you are Gordon Freeman, a scientist with a degree in theoretical physics working at the Black Mesa science facility. Quickly after starting the game you will find yourself in a test chamber running an experiment with your colleagues, when everything swiftly goes horribly wrong, resulting in countless deaths and an ongoing Xen/government fiasco you will have to endure in order to survive. Skip a little bit ahead to avoid spoilers, and you will eventually find yourself in the middle of a plot of mystery, in which very few questions are ever answered. Half-Life ends on a cliff hanger, and then it's on to Half-Life 2, or the DLC's to see if any of these questions are answered there. That's where I'm going now, but first I'll type up some final thoughts for this review.\n\nFinal Thoughts Half-Life is a classic FPS that has undoubtedly influenced almost every title in the genre that has come after it. Despite some rough edges to keep in mind, I can easily recommend Half-Life to every single fan of the FPS genre. And no, "its old" is not a valid reason to avoid this game. It's older than I am and I still loved it.\n\nPersonal Rating: 9.5/10","April 16","true","10.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpmrx/recommended/70/","dpmrx","Viishnahn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpmrx/","159 products in account","If you're a gamer and have never heard the name Half-Life, I'm sorry to say that you're either overly sheltered, willfully ignorant or just too young. For those of us who enjoy First-Person Shooter [FPS] games, Half-Life was just as influential to the genre as Doom or Quake (for those of you who have never heard of these titles, Wikipedia is your friend). Classics such as Halo: Combat Evolved and newer titles such as Bioshock: Infinite have been influenced by this game, and older games such as Counter-Strike were mods of Half-Life. In short, the entire FPS genre has been creatively influenced by the atmosphere and style of Half-Life.                          - FYI: Final Score is at the end -\n\n- The Look -\n\nHalf-Life was released by Valve (the parent company of Steam) in 1998 for the PC. As such, the graphics are abysmal by modern standards. If you are a nostalgic gamer such as myself, though, the low graphics can be humorous and even add to the charm of the game at times. There are numerous texture packs available if you cannot handle such old graphics.\n\n- The Story (Mild Spoiler Alert) -\n\nYou're a government agent/scientist who gets involved with some experiments on unknown substances. Through testing these substances, you somehow open a portal and unleash an alien horde into the testing facility. You must then find and fight your way out of the facility. Pretty simple and straightforward-sounding. Half-Life was the first-ever game to tell its story completely through scripted sequences (events triggered by certain programmable requirements) and as such has no cutscenes. This is a very nice element to the game as you retain control of your character throughout the entire game.\n\n- The Sounds -\n\nFor some reason, Valve decided they needed to make everything sound like it was coming from the inside of an echo chamber. There is a lot of reverb on just about every noise if you are not completely outdoors. Again, this is an element where modern technology has progressed as to make this appear foolish and unappealing. Give it some time before you make any judgments, though. The effect enhances the scariness of some situations, in my opinion. If you ever play any of the other Valve games (Portal, Team Fortress 2, Portal 2, etc.), you will discover that a LOT of sounds and music in those games originated from Half-Life.\n\n- The Movement -\n\nYou run. You run a lot. You run really fast. You have the option to walk and the option to sneak, but 98% of the time you will be running. Sometimes, especially for unfamiliar novices to the game, the speed is too much and you end up running into an alien patrol before you realize that you just passed through that hallway. You will eventually get used to it, though. Half-Life was one of the first games (if not the first; I'm not sure) to implement the "jump-crouch" concept. If you jump and hold the crouch button, you can actually jump onto higher platforms. Instead of lowering your body, jump-crouching raises your legs and feet, giving you more clearance to vault onto objects.\n\n- The Combat -\n\nIf an enemy sees you, they will throw a grenade. Expect to be spammed if you are spotted. Half-Life is a quick-save/quick-load supportive game; you can choose to disregard this if you want a "purist" experience. Enemies in this game are rather easy to defeat in the beginning and get harder as the game progresses, but each new type presents its own unique traits that make it hard to kill. The weapon switching system is confusing to a modern gamer at first; it requires you to scroll (or press hot-key) and then left-click to actually arm that weapon. The left shift button, by default, switches instantaneously back to the previous weapon used, allowing for a much faster switch. Weapons and ammo are decently plentiful if you are conservative enough.\n\n- The Mods and The Legacy -\n\nHalf-Life is the number one most modded game of all time. There are more mods available for this game than any other, followed by Morrowind and Quake. The mods have spawned entire new game series, as in the case of Counter-Strike and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Half-Life also holds the trophy for another gaming phenomenon: most-played for speedruns. If you are unfamiliar with a speedrun, the gist is that you attempt to start and finish the game as fast as possible.\n\n- The Downsides -\n\nHalf-Life is an ancient piece of software by today's standards. With the advent of 2015, this game is now 17 years old (nearly old enough to purchase cigarettes!). Its age shows in many things. Several furniture items are completely cubic or square and have no roundness. Cockroaches are diamond-shaped. There are only three different models used for the human enemies and three for the friendly scientists. Each alien type has only one model/skin. The NPCs and enemies can get very repetitive at times, as such. Other than this, there aren't very many bad points to Half-Life. Its continued success and popularity speak for its quality and innovation.\n\n- The Conclusion -\n\nHalf-Life is a classic in many gamers' opinions. I am of the same mindset. I completely recommend this game, despite its age and shortcomings, as a fun experience that will provide a decent challenge.\n\nFinal Score: 10/10","January 8, 2015","true","16.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

G-man a.k.a Government Man (The slang is right here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-Man_%28slang%29 if you don't know what it means) interests me because of his mysterious behaviour & everyone still wants to know if he fights for good or evil but some things in life can't be answered but I don't know if we could all handle the truth.... if you really want more questions added I would suggest this video it gives out some good theories on G-Man & many others you can watch on youtube. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HmxQi09brI\n\nThe game has few minor bugs but the game still holds out as one of the grandfathers of the FPS genre & still popular for a 16 year old game so my final verdict is to get this game. Don't forget keep some head crabs as souvenirs on your grand adventures in Black Mesa, Freeman's grandkids might want it for their school project or for bragging rights on how cool their grandpa was back in his scientific glory. (If you feel like I missed something feel free to leave feedback)\n\nBonus: This is a great video if you want G-Man & Nihilanth talked about at the same time https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzkPO_nDdFU\n\nBonus 2: You should check out Black Mesa if you can find it http://wiki.blackmesasource.com/Black_Mesa:About_the_Mod\n\nHere's a gameplay vid of the mod - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kgO9el3eT4\n\nBonus 3: Here's a list of popular mods I found - http://www.moddb.com/games/half-life/mods?sort=rating-desc\n\nFun Fact: Cry Of Fear was originally a Half Life mod & in the beginning of the game it has a Half Life poster in one of the rooms\n\nThe mod is on steam if you want to try it out http://store.steampowered.com/app/223710/","December 3, 2014","true","22.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Released in 1998 by Sierra Studios , in Half-Life, you assume the role of Dr. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist who must fight his way out of a secret underground research facility whose research and experiments into teleportation technology have gone disastrously wrong. Half-Life is a first-person shooter that requires the player to perform combat tasks and puzzle solving to advance through the game. Compared to most first-person shooters of the time, which relied on cut-scene intermissions to detail their plotlines, Half-Life‍ '​s story is told entirely by means of scripted sequences, keeping you in control of the first-person viewpoint. In line with this, the game has no cut-scenes, and you rarely loses the ability to control Gordon, who never speaks and is never actually seen in the game; the player sees "through his eyes" for the entire length of the game. It also has multiplayer and because this is not the original version, it comes with an HD texture pack, which looks gorgeous in game. Although having not played on an actual servers I have played LAN with one of my friends and in my first experience I thought it was spot on, there are so much maps and also many weapons for you to use. Overall I would give Half-Life a rating of 9/10 stars, for a 1998 game this is absolutely fantastic . The story is very interesting and fun to play through, you feel like you really are playing as Gordon this is an absolutely must buy for a price of $6 you are getting such a great deal. I am absolutely 100% sure without a doubt that Half-Life will just blow you away!.","October 7, 2015","true","5.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

As a scientist.  Going to work.  Just like any other day...\n\nThe level design was phenominal and vaired.  The combat was robust and fun.\n\nI'll stop there.\n\nThe bottom line is...this game costs almost nothing and will run on almost anything out there today.  Your excuses are limited to why you wouldn't try your hand at this classic.\n\nModern gamers might have to put on rose covered glasses and step back a few years to fully appreciate it when it was cutting edge and new...but names like Blast Pit, Surface Tension, and Xen still mentioned by some with warm feelings and happy memories even to this day.

With a simple change in concept compared to other big games of the time, namely the fact that you never leave the players field of vision, the focus was always on the player, even during special events in the storyline. And the story - what a story it was and still is!\n\nIn the game, you play as Gordon Freeman, an M.I.T graduate in Theoretical Physics, who is called to the Black Mesa Complex as a Research Associate for a large-scale experiment involving alien artifacts. Already from the get-go, you may pass your time by speaking to, or just listen to the conversations between scientists and security guards. You may interact with doors, buttons, microwaves, soda machines - I mean, what more can anyone ask for, right?\n\nI am not going to spoil the story for anyone interested in playing the game themselves (go play it already, if you haven't!), but I can say that the ability to interact with the surrounding world is something that the player learns to appreciate throughout the game. Because of this ability, there are often several ways to complete a certain task (moving boxes, blowing things up, pressing a switch so that you don't get caught by an electrified wire etc.). This is something that  works very well with the game's overall story and design.\n\nAs the game progresses, Gordon comes face to face with stronger and stronger enemies who use different tactics to bring him down. Without ever uttering a word, Gordon swings his Crowbar (or perhaps his trusted shotgun) and plows them through, persevering through yet another life-threatening situation. It is just how badass he is (you are).\n\nMost of the times though, there is a lot of button-pushing in this game. Luckily, this is where the M.I.T-graduation comes in handy - for who could ever push a button the way M.I.T graduates can? Jokes aside though, he is darn fast at climbing ladders (while holding his crowbar with two hands - how does he do it?)!\n\nPersonally, I really enjoy this game through and through. The Source engine allows for some slick movement and fast-paced gaming. If you take your time to listen to random scientists, you may or may not be surprised to hear that many of them are just as human as you and me. This is something that adds to the game and integrates the player further into the story, in my opinion. The story is great and the enemies have very advanced A.I for the time (1998, remember - that's 16 years ago!). I would recommend this game for every and any player who has ever played FPS-games, but even more so to any Quake, Doom or Unreal Tournament fans out there.

The underground transit system was huge. What was this place? A friendly female voice welcomed me.\n\n"Good Morning, and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit system. This automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the Black Mesa research facility personnel. The time is 8:47 a.m., current topside temperature is 93 degrees with an estimated high of 105. The Black Mesa compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all times. This train is inbound from level three dormitories to sector C test labs and control facilities. If your intended destination is a high security area beyond sector C, you will need to return to the central transit hub in sector G and board a high security train. If you have not yet submitted your identity to a retinal client system, you must report to Black Mesa personnel for processing before you will be permitted to enter the high security branch of the transit system. Due to the high toxicity of the materials routinely handled in the Black Mesa Compound, no smoking, eating, or drinking is permitted inside the transit system. Please keep your limbs in the train at all times. Do not attempt to open the doors until the train has come to a complete stop at the station platform. In the event of an emergency, passengers are to remain seated and await further instructions. If it is necessary to leave the train, disabled personnel should be evacuated first. Please, stay away from electrified rails and proceed to an emergency station until assistance arrives. A reminder that the Black Mesa hazard course decathlon will commence this evening at 19:00 hours, in the level 3 facility. The semi-finals will later be announced in the secure access train. Remember, more lives than your own may depend on your fitness. Do you have a friend or relative who would make a valuable addition to the Black Mesa team? Immediate openings are available in the areas of: materials handling, and low clearance security. Please contact Black mesa personnel if you would like to sponsor someone. If you have any education in the areas of theoretical physics, unusual technology, or other high-end disciplines, contacts the Black Mesa facility. A reminder to all personnel: Regular radiation and biohazard screenings are a requirement of continued employment in the Black Mesa Research Facility. Missing a scheduled analysis or check-up is grounds for immediate termination. If you feel you have been exposed to radioactive or other materials, contact your head of duties and contact your radiation safety officer immediately. Work safe, work smart, your future depends on it. Now arriving at sector C test labs and control facilities. Please stand back from the automated door, and wait for the security officer to confirm your identity. Before exiting the train, be sure to check you area for personal belongings. Thank you, and have a very safe and productive day."\n\nFinally, the ride came to a halt.The guard opened the door and I entered the administration centre.\n\n"Morning, Mr. Freeman. Looks like you’re running late. "\n\nAnd so it began.\n\nOne of the best games ever made, a genre defining classic. An intriguing story/universe, the start of something 'special'.\n\n"With my brains and your brawn we'll make an excellent team."\n\nI want to go back. Please Valve, let me go back to Black Mesa.\n\n10/10","January 3","true","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Play this game, you won't regret buying it.\n\nP.S Who buys HL2 just to play Garry's Mod, i see 10 minutes of half life gameplay and 100+ hours of DarkRP...

I still remember when my good friend Brandon and I started up the game for the first time and we were just amazed at the opening scene. It's the most mundane scripted piece but you have to understand that, in that time period, this kind of real immersive gameplay simply didn't exist. It was revolutionary.\n\nThis set the tone for the rest of the game. The scripted events, the continuous gameplay, the lack of loading screens, the beautifully designed levels, the complex storyline that was revealed gradually not through expository cut scenes, but, through observation; this was new and it was amazing.\n\nThe multiplayer scene of Half-Life was equally new and exciting. Half-Life was hardly the birthplace of online First Person Shooter deathmatch; that belongs to Doom and its successor Quake. But that community migrated to Half-Life and I was aware of their presence and respected their experience, hardly realizing that I myself was experiencing a change in gaming.\n\nYou can't talk about Half-Life multiplayer without talking about the mods. 'Science and Industry', 'Action Half-Life', 'Day of Defeat', 'Pirates, Vikings and Knights' and, of course, 'Counter-Strike', a series which has gone on to become the biggest name in online FPS gaming. These ever evolving player made modifications were apart of a thriving creative community that came together to celebrate Half-Life's GoldSrc engine and the possibilities it presented for user-created content. It was a wonderful time.\n\nHalf-Life's glory has since been eclipsed by its successor, Half-Life 2, which PC Gamer named as the greatest game of all time on their 2015 annual list. The original Half-Life, however, still represents a special time period for gaming, both in my group of friends and in the wider world of PC gaming.\n\nRemoving myself for just a moment from the pangs of nostalgia, is Half-Life still a game I'd recommend? The answer is an unequivocal yes. It's still beautiful, fun, innovative, atmospheric and has a heck of a story. It's video game history.

WRITTEN REVIEW NOT COMPLETE\n\nquote. Scientist: [playing with tie] Why do we all have to wear these ridiculous ties?.\n\nDeveloped by Valve and released in 1998\n\nPros and Cons\n\npros. Everything\ncons. Nothing\n\nSTORYLINE\nA mysterious Alien Artifact has been recovered and brought to a top-secret research facility in the Black Mesa. When newcomer Dr. Gordon Freeman is assigned to physically test the artifact, things go very wrong when the artifact opens a destructive and unstable portal to Xen, a planet in a different dimension. Gordon blacks out, and awakes in a now crippled and ruined research facility. When Freeman and the survivors of this ordeal discover the portal has allowed its inhabitants-deadly alien creatures-to enter the facility, they realise that they must call the government for help. The government, however, already has plans to contain this incident by silencing the witnesses.\n\nHalf life's story is a very diverse and confusing one, but is still executed brilliantly. since Half Life does not rely on cut scenes, there are moments when subtle important plot references are hinted towards key features of the story, but these references can be left unnoticed especially on a first play-through. This really depends on the player and their play style if you are to notice these references. Therefore this game mechanic should not be seen as a flaw rather as an attempt to try something new that valve knew very well wouldn’t mix with everyone.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nHalf life is the most influential First Person Game Ever Made. This is best exemplified through its game play mechanics. Let me explain.\n\nGrowing up as a young grommet the only fps game I was familiar with was DOOM. At the time DOOM was piratically seen as the best pc game of all time. All fps games two follow copied the DOOM formula, all except half life. You see Doom had\n\n.NO Apparent storyline\n.NO Interesting characters\n.NO Absorbing atmosphere [It felt very arcade like]\n.And no real apparent goal\n\nThe game was really a stress reviler where you just shoot s.hit and blow c.unts up. Not saying DOOM is a bad game. DOOM is one of my favourite games its just that Half life beat DOOM at the fps formula in all ways by Half Life having\n\n.A fantastic and engaging story.\n.A scary immersive atmosphere.\n.A roster of witty and interesting characters.\n.A simplified moving mechanic\n.A mechanic where you could look up and down.{ thank F.UCK for that }\n.A Mixture of action and Puzzles\n.And a game with an apparent goal from the very start.\n\nYou see Half Life wasn’t one of those games where you would just shoot s.hit and blows c.unts up. Half Life was the first real fps game to feel like a immersive gaming experience. Therefore we have half life to thank for saving and changing what was commonly thought of as the First Person Shooter Genre.\n\nPACING\nHalf Life Pacing is Executed very well. The game has the whole survival horror game feel to it and the game really exemplifies this through a sense of dread. At the start of the game it is apparent that you need to escape the black mesa facility but only an hour down the track you start to lose recognition of that thought and just have the mindset of surviving, and that is why this games pacing is so good. You never quite feel like you have an objective to do rather you just feel you have to survive. and coupling this with the fine selection of jump-scares and mind blowing scripted events it truly holds up.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN\nValve has a name for level design in their games. Its hard to describe on paper but no gaming developer team does it like valve, you just have to see it for yourself, I mean talk about attention to detail. Before Half Life level design in fps video games were very simplistic and felt like an arcade experience. Half Life's level design was truly ahead of its time. Structures would collapse, you could interact with all most everything from the environment, and the game used a clever use of scripted events through the level design. It is very hard to explain on paper but you can tell a lot of work was put into this category of game design for half life.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nHalf-Life soundtrack consists of a techno and ambience like tracks. One of Half Life's key elements two its atmosphere is said soundtrack. Half Life's soundtrack always seems to change conveniently creating a completely different mood and atmosphere to the last segment of the game. The use of ambience like tracks for the more creepy, mysterious moments through out the game coupled with the techno prodigy like tracks for the scripted action moments through out the game really create an experience like no other. Not two mention the end credits theme witch really feels rewarding and catchy... here is a link to the end credits theme soundtrack https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXpGM6NgrZ8","October 16, 2015","true","18.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","3","3","3","0"

The graphics will look dated to some, and the sound can be unbearable to others, but the story and the way the environment is layed out makes you realize how much work went into this (It must have been amazing to play this in 1998).\n\nThe game is the classic shooter experience where you grind through waves of enemies, sometimes fighting a boss or one of the huge mobs that appear from time to time. The game is very hard, even at the lower difficulties (much harder than HL2) and is a good challenge for fans of old-school FPS classics such as Doom and Quake.\n\nI recommend any game from the Half-Life series because of the effort that went into making these games.

However, you'll have to survive from the attacks of your coworkers transformed in zombies and creatures coming from another world. And unfortunately for you, your only weapon is a crowbar. And you're just a scientist employed by Black Mesa...\n\nThat's Half-Life for you. A scientist relying on a crowbar first before becoming an expert in weapons. The story is perhaps basic and with some twists but noneless, the universe build around Half-Life has expanded a lot.\n\nHowever, if Half-Life is a FPS, which means weapons to shoot any enemies, that you can carry thanks to your wonderful combinaison, you can find some puzzles throughout the game, mainly because of the need to wander around a destroyed facility.\n\nWhat's fascinating in Half-Life isn't probably the gameplay in itself. I mean, everything seems very basic. But if it wasn't for it, you wouldn't have mods like Counter-Strike around. I don't know why I was fascinated by Half-Life. I mean, it's not like jumping was new or that weapons were innovative... maybe the iconic crowbar has to do something with. Or maybe it's just that a plot, perhaps basic but very effective, the mysterious G-Man following you around and disappearing easily or that the fact it's someone that wasn't trained to become the hero of the world... or maybe the ending. I don't know but I just know that when I played it, I was fascinated.\n\nI was fascinated by the fact that you can find survivors around that can help you, guards or scientists. Or the fact that some of them meet a tragic fate under your eyes. I was fascinated by the change of the objectives: from reaching the surface, you're now the only hope to end an invasion and the wiping of any survivor by the soldiers.\n\nI don't remember any problem with the gameplay apart the treacherous ladders. Climbing them isn't hard. However, when you needed to step out of them OR going down, it was a challenge. And the famous jumping with the crates where you were sliding...\n\nHalf-Life has the graphics from 1998 and it was very good ones. Even now, I could still enjoy them. I don't say that it's detailed. But you can see some interesting details. And Xen, the other world, despite being a challenge, is very beautiful.\n\nBesides, the soundtrack is also great. It's only heard during some important moments. But the music is powerful.\n\nHalf-Life is a classic to have. Gordon Freeman is a character that you can't forget.","November 19, 2010","true","25.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, no game innovated it's genre as much as Half Life. Before 1998, fps games didn't have any story, instead you simply blasted through levels to beat the game. Half Life added a story, with talking characters and all the parts of a storyline you heard in that crappy English class. Then Half Life starred a huge modding community, which produced some of Valve's biggest franchises, not to mention started up some other popular developers. After all of this, Half Life 2 came out and became the new star.\n\nOverall Half Life is great, and I recommend it for everyone to try.\n\nP.S: Notice how I didn't recommend Half Life: Source?

Freeman participa de um experimento que dá errado, criando um efeito cascata que ocasiona a invasão de aliens no local. Assim, ele precisa entender como reverter o incidente. O jogo tem diversos tipos de armas e de inimigos que, sem querer dar muito spoiler, não se limitam a extra-terrestres. A ação é o foco, mas não quer dizer que você não terá que parar e pensar um pouco em alguns momentos para resolver situações pontuais a fim de poder progredir. Uma facilidade que o jogo tem é poder salvá-lo a qualquer momento. Hoje em dia os gráficos não são tão atrativos, mas para a época de lançamento com certeza surpreenderam.

A scientist who works for the Black Mesa facility. And an experiment you took part in has gone completely awry, unleashing an extraterestrial invasion, and now all hell has broken loose in Black Mesa. Your main goal is to survive and to stop the invasion, using the help of surviving Black Mesa employees, whatever you can get your hands on and your own bare wits.\n\nEven if it is over a decade old, Half Life has aged very, very well. In fact it seems to do some things better than most Modern shooters - you can hold a heck of a lot of weapons for example, a great feature that barely has any presence in shooters nowadays. The gunplay is intense but fair, and you have a huge multitude of weapons to utilise - and they are all great and feel powerful. Enemy types are plentiful, varied and can get pretty darn tough as the game progresses. The enemy AI itself is intelligent and fierce - especially the soldiers who know how to flank well and work together. There are friendly NPC's as well, which are actually helpful: Security guards can help deliver covering fire and scientists can unlock doors and heal you if you are low on health. The game also takes good advantage of the environmental elements around it, technically making almost everything a threat or obstacle - some bridges can be destroyed which may require you to find another way around it, wet floors are obviously slippy so you need to be careful not to slide into an elevator shaft - Did I also mention that elevators in this game are barely ever safe? All of these great uses of particular stage elements called for some fantastically designed levels and puzzles that require a skilled gamer to complete.\n\nGraphically, I will admit the game does look a bit blocky by today's standards and the character animations are pretty wooden, but each level within Half Life looks worlds apart from one another, especially the last part of the game, trust me, it's amazing, that's all I'm saying about it, I'm not gonna spoil it. The character and enemy designs themselves, most notably the aliens, are really creative, unique and varied. The real time cutscenes were cutting edge back in the day and even though the choppy and kinda unexistant character animations during these cutscenes are now dated in a sense, the fact that they are REAL TIME just makes them very immersive and makes you feel part of a great story.\n\nWhen it comes to audio, the soundeffects are great and fits Half Life's sci-fi tone, and the guns are LOUD. The music tracks, although few and far between, are fantastic and give off great atmosphere. The voiceacting is also great, even if the recordings are a bit grainy.\n\nIf there was anything I thought that did detract from the overall quality from the game, is the fact that sometimes the player can get glitched in certain parts of the environment, so they can't move, therefore they would need to restart from the last save... but then again this barely ever happens.\n\nTl;dr Half Life is a groundbreaking FPS that has stood the test of time and I still consider it as one of the best shooters ever made, if not the best. An immersive, action packed, incredibly varied FPS that makes you feel like an action hero. Highly recommended to anyone who has at least an interest in videogames.","March 26, 2014","true","17.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Well actually, alot. This game is absolutely fantastic. Personally, I prefer it over 2. Anyways, with my opinion out of the way, I'm going to elaborate about why this game is so  great.\nThe story starts with you, Gordon Freeman. The 27 year old scientist with a degree in Theoretical Physics. Not much to say about that.\nYour workplace, Black Mesa, gets attacked by various aliens and the marines when an transfer goes wrong.\nThe thing about this game is that theres a huge element of surprise. You'll find out what I mean when you play the game.\nYea.\nPlot twists, man.\nAnyways, the gameplay. That makes the whole game.\nThe gameplay is absolutely fantastic for an FPS. However, this isn't just any FPS with some macho guy ripping monster heads off because it's fun (I'm looking at you, Duke Nukem.)\nThis is, what I would call an action-adventure FPS. This game really set the standard for the genre.\nThere's a fair assortment of weapons. Speaking of weapons, you're going to need ammo. Alot of it.\nThat's not necessarily a bad thing - it's everywhere. Or atleast, it's not very hard to find ammo.\nThe other thing with this game is that, you, the player needs to be very patient. This game has backtracking. Alot of it.\nNext thing, the graphics. The graphics aged fairly well, in my opinion. Sure, some of the models might look wonky, but it can be easily fixed with a few HD mods.\nThere is music in this game. Although, they only really play during intense parts, it's still quite well composed.\nIf you look past the backtracking and constant dying, you'll love this game. Trust me.\nIt's absolutely fantastic, and really set the standards for the FPS genre after 1998.\nThat's not all I have to say about Half-Life, but if I did, you and I would be here all day.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n9.5/10\nAn absolute fantabulous masterpiece","January 16, 2014","true","18.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spackeck/recommended/70/","spackeck","Spackeck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spackeck/","301 products in account","Despite its age, Half-Life is still one of the greatest examples of organic storytelling in video games. Valve’s debut title succeeds where most modern games fail—in telling a story without interrupting the game’s pacing or forcing its narrative down the player’s throat.\n\nIn fact, the only time Half-Life interrupts it’s frenetic pace is to spoon feed you simplistic puzzles designed to showcase Valve’s fancy 'GoldSrc' engine, and while I’m sure it all looked fantastic back in 1998, it’s lost its relevance, and the frequent interruptions to the game are totally arbitrary now that we’ve seen things like physics engines become commonplace.\n\nDespite technological shortcomings, the way Half-Life tells a story is better than any that came before it and most that came after it. It’s subtle and understated, favouring brief snippets of dialogue between a pair of marines or a brief set piece of a scientist being dragged into an air duct over lengthy cutscenes of exploding helicopters. It gives an air of realism contrary to the game’s sci-fi setting and sometimes over-the-top tone, and it’s a real testament to the value of organic exposition that such evocative atmospheres can be created through such subtle methods.\n\nSurprisingly, Half-Life doesn’t let itself be carried by its storytelling. The narrative is built around solid core gameplay that boasts the tactical complexity of a more modern title on top of the large array of weapons reminiscent of older shooters. As I’ve previously mentioned, the enemy AI is subpar by today’s standards, but it’s really the level design that makes the combat stand out. The environments are varied and engaging in such a way that retains atmospheric consistency while providing some excellent combat scenarios.\n\nHalf-Life will always be a classic, and despite some janky behaviour that’s become more evident as its aged, it’s a fantastic shooter—easily one of the best to date.","April 7","true","33.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

And Half-Life IS fun, Its got a wide and diverse range of weapons and enemies (as well as some cool bosses) and some brilliant AI that still impresses me today.\n\nBut what really makes Half-Life a really stand out game is what it does that is different. Rather then going the way of a metal gear solid game valve opted for a really interesting minimal storytelling approach in which everything is witnessed through the gameplay, there are no cutscenes of any kind. The less is more approach works and instead of long pieces of poorly written dialogue the game lets you observe first hand the chaos and destruction in the aftermath of the Black Mesa Incident. It works and the atmosphere feels like the aftermath of some kind of horrible and ongoing disaster like a huricane or a Nuclear blast In which you must fight for your life throughout the game to escape.\n\nRather than explain everything to you Half-Life will show you a lot of things or occasionaly say things that may confuse you. This is because you are just one man and its impossible for you to comprehend the big picture, you are small and insignificant in this grand scheme going on and while you get vague hints throughout the game as to this bigger picture the game leaves you guessing which gives the game a large sense of a forboding and sinister mystery .\n\nThis game is built on atmosphere and while the graphics have aged a lot, it is still a breath taking experiance to witness the disaster and destruction of Black Mesa. The sounds and music are top notch and aid with this of course.\n\nIf you are one of the few people who has not played Half-Life yet I really suggest that you get around to it, you wont just have fun but I think It will probably influence your opinion on how Video Game stories and atmosphere should be handled in relation to gameplay.","December 7, 2014","true","37.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

Instead I'll just write the story of why I bought it, or mainly how I got into Steam\n\nWay back in 2012 when I was first introduced to the internet and memes, I had seen many Half Life 3 memes and I was curious as to why it was so popular, but I never bothered to research it and just went along with it. Eventually, in 2013, I created a Steam account (or maybe it was in late 2012) because of people talking about TF2 and I wanted to see what made it so great, so I downloaded TF2 and I didn't really understand how to play or what I was doing then I lost my login credentials to my Steam account and created 2 more before I finally got to this one. I didn't use Steam much at the time other than to play TF2 and I got my friends involved, too. After a while I went outside my TF2 bubble and started browsing games during a Christmas sale and bought 2 games that got a lot of attention on the internet as well, Fallout 3 and Skyrim. I played them almost 24/7 and then summer came and the 2014 summer sale started, but I had to miss out because I spent 2/3 of the summer away from home. When I came home I got back on Steam and then in August school started up, but that didn't stop me from browsing Steam and building a wishlist (I rarely got money at the time) and I found half-Life and all the other Half-Life games so I wishlisted them all. As time passed, my library grew, my wishlist shrunk, but the Half-Life games always stayed. Then, sometime in March I bought a $20 Steam wallet card and used it to buy a $10 game off my wishlist and I saved the rest for when I had more money to get a more expensive game. Then next week Lego games went on sale and I added another $5 to my account so I had $15, enough to get the Lego Batman trilogy (or at least one of the 2 I didn't own) but then I realized I could get the complete HL 1 anthology for $15 so I bought it, and played Half-Life then fell in love with the series","June 11, 2015","true","9.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Not your usual shoot-'em-up, this game isn't for trigger-happy seven year olds who settle their disputes with digital figures because they're too weak in real life. No, this game invovles a lot of the thinking involved in Portal (although on a much smaller scale)--there's no objective dot like in Call of Duty. Definitely a must buy. And the multiplayer, however cheesy it may seem, is simply incredible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/piratepony/recommended/70/","piratepony","MisturPandaa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/piratepony/","17 products in account","Half-Life I was a game I'd heard a lot about, but I had neer played anything like it (the closest was probably 007: Goldeneye, so I wasn't quite certain of what I was getting into at first, but the Half-Life collection was on sale for only some $15, so I figured I'd take a risk.\nAnd I'm so glad I did.  I decided, on a whim, to play it on its hardest difficulty, and I recommend you do the same, because it's just hard enough to make you be really careful, but not so hard to bring you to throw your controller across the room.\nI'll address my thoughts on Half-Life I in the tradition of YouTube reviewer The Completionist:\n\nStory 9/10\nA la Zelda I, story takes a backseat in Half Life I, and I personally really like that.  There IS a story, but unlike in so many triple-A titles, it doesn't demand so much attention that the rest is neglected.  The story that exists can basically be summed up like this:\nYou are Gordon Freeman, a scientist with special training in the use of a power-augmenting suit, working in a top-secret facility known as Black Mesa.  After an experiment goes horribly wrong, alien creatures with no greater purpose than to kill and infect humans begin appearing around the facility, and you, as one of the only able-bodied people alive, must fight your way out of the death trap that Black Mesa has become.  But along the way, you notice a mysterious man watching your every move...\nAnd that's it.  Most of the developments throughout the game are finding out one teensy little detail about Black Mesa's past through a stray word in normal dialogue or through coming across the aforementioned mysterious figure who watches you throughout the game.\nI love it.  Having the story be so simple lets the gameplay and puzzles take a much larger role in my mind.  Instead of thinking to myself, "I have to get past this puzzle so that I can know what happened to Jim," I'm thinking "hmm...if I only have 27 health and I need to get past the lightning-throwing alien with only two bullets in my revolver, how quick will I need to fire?  And how close should I get?  Are there more enemies around him?  Maybe I could sneak past him and find a stock of ammo..." and so on.  The game prompts the player to think so much, in part because you're playing it not for the story but for the puzzles.\nThat is, in my opinion, one of Half-Life I's strongest points.  However, I don't give it a 10/10 for story because I feel like it could be just a little bit more engaging.  If it were as engaging as Portal I in story, it would be absolutely perfect.\n\nGameplay 9.8/10\nThis game is so damn fun to play.  The controls, at least for PC, are fantastic, because you can make them be whatever the crap you want.  Because it's an FPS, you NEED to have a mouse, but what self-respecting gamer doesn't?  (Unless you like to make games harder by playing them without a mouse on purpose, in which case, props to you.)  Like I said in the "Story" section, gameplay takes an incredibly important role in this game, and was absolutely perfected.\nOne of the reasons for this is that the gameplay is so simple.  You can jump, you can shoot/use various weapons, you can crouch, and you can use a flashlight.  That's it.  No silly quick-time events, no complicated set of moves, no vast arrays of powers, just jumping, weapons, crouching, and flashlight.\nWhat gives the game depth from here is the plethora of different weapons you can get.  No weapon is similar in more than one way, and every one has different strengths and weaknesses.  Basically, no one weapon is "the best"; even the strongest weapon in the game, the lazer gun, is balanced out because you can have an absolute maximum of 60 shots, and because it fires so rapidly, it's easy to use more ammo than you needed to.  My favorite weapon by far is the revolver, because it has a nice sound, it reloads fast, and it does great damage.  It's big drawbacks, however, are that ammo for it is very scarce, and so must be well-conserved, and it has pretty slow firing time.  And all weapons are like that: the crowbar is the weakest weapon, and must be used up close, but it uses no ammo and so has no reload time; the machine gun has the fastest firing and reload times, and can double as a grenade launcher if you have ammo for it, but really low damage and is hard to aim; the rocket launcher deals enormous damage, but can easily kill you, has terrible reload and firing time, ammo is scarce, and the shots automatically will fly around and hit nothing if you don't get reasonably close to your enemy; and the list goes on and on.\nSomehow, Half Life I gives you a wide array of interesting and equally useful weapons to use in the different situations it puts you in.  Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses, every one is useful in different situations, and any could end up your favorite without that impacting your enjoyment of the game.\nThe only reason I don't give gameplay a 10/10 is because the rocket launcher's rockets are the biggest pain in the butt to hit anything with.\n\nPresentation 10/10\nThis game was revolutionary for its time, and still looks great.  It's not COD: AW, but I like that it doesn't need to use the crutch of HD graphics like some games.  The music is fantastic, and used sparingly, which helps a ton with the mood, because you'll know when something important is happening just because of music playing.  There isn't much to say here, because it's not something you really notice, but overall, the presentation is perfect.\n\nTrue Completionist fans are expecting me to move on to the final component of his reviewing style, the final level, but the problem is, I haven't gotten there yet.  I just wanted to post this review now, and I might come back and edit it later to add the "Final Level" portion if I feel like it.  (But no promises; I probably won't.)\n\nOverall: 9.6/10\nVerdict: What the hell are you waiting for?  BUY IT!!!","November 26, 2014","true","113.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hammer_corps/recommended/70/","hammer_corps","Hammercorps","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hammer_corps/","147 products in account","NOTE: This review is only for the single-player campaign.\n\nIn 1998, a first-person shooter called Half-Life was released by a virtually unknown startup company called Valve. It\nshattered sales records, shot to the top of the review charts,won over 50 Game of the Year awards, and redefined the FPS genre. Yet, how does it hold up today?\n\n\nGraphics: Half-Life's graphics, while stunning back in 1998, have aged very poorly. Textures are blurry, and character models are blocky (even with the HD Texture pack from 2001.) The lighting has aged somewhat better than the rest of the game although it is still dated. Black Mesa itself is rather boring to look at, as it is mostly gray corridors and vent shafts which is a shame because that is where the majority of the game takes place. The desert outside and the levels set on Xen are far more interesting in design though. For me though, graphics are the last thing that I pay attention to in a game, so it's by no means a deal breaker for me.\n\n\nGameplay: Ah, now here is where Half-Life's meat is (along with its story.) It was universally praised for its polished and fun mix of shooting and puzzles, and for raising the standards of FPS gameplay completely. In my opinion, some of this praise still holds true, but Half-Life's gameplay has aged well in some aspects and not so well in others.\nBy far, the best aged part of the gameplay is the shooting. It still feels good after 16 years, with a nice variety of weapons that are all fun to use (shotgun FTW!) and continue to remain useful throughout the 10 hour campaign. There are a nice variety of enemies, too, from the Xen aliens (all with different attacks,) and the HECU Marines, who at the time were considered to have some of the most advanced AI in any game, and still pose a challenge to fight (although this is more due to their incredibly annoying tendency to move around a ton making them hard to hit then for their AI.) There are also boss fights, a staple of 90's FPS's. Thankfully, these boss fights are mostly done well, with the exception that I feel that the final boss's solution is a bit too obtuse. What hasn't aged well are the puzzles. While I don't mind puzzles in FPS games to mix up the gameplay, the puzzles here are platforming puzzles, another 90's staple. These puzzles feel like they really break up the otherwise great pacing of the game, and I always feel a bit annoyed whenever one comes across. However, they are thankfully short and shouldn't be a huge problem to master. The game also includes friendly NPCs, another reason it was lauded, but these NPCs are rather useless except to move the plot along.  Overall, Half-Life's gameplay is still enjoyable, even if it does feel a bit dated.\n\nStory/Atmosphere: The other reason Half-Life was so well-received was for its (at the time,) immersive atmosphere and well-written story. This still holds true, mostly. You play as Gordon Freeman, Theoretical Physicist and employee of the top-secret Back Mesa Research Facility, a government facility deep beneath the New Mexico desert. During a normal day at work, an experiment goes horribly wrong, causing a fictional "resonance cascade" and opening a tear between Black Mesa and the alien borderworld of Xen. You must find a way to close the dimensional tear and save Earth, while battling the hostile aliens and US soldiers sent by the government to liquidate the personnel and cover up the incident. The plot itself, although rather simple, is still well-written and still solid even today. Even with some hilariously entertaining voice-acting it still gets its hooks into you and manages to keep you interested for the well-executed twist ending. The atmosphere, however, still holds up very well. Even with the bad graphics, Half-Life remains immersive partially due to the fact that there are no cutscenes, leaving you in control of Gordon the entire time, and partially due to the fact that it still has some great sound design. This game was considered to be very scary when it came out, and although that has faded away, the game can still startle you when a headcrab leaps out from a vent or when a Vortigaunt comes hissing around the corner and fries you with green energy. The soundtrack is also very minimal, barely playing at all during the game, although what you do hear sounds fairly nice, with a techno beat.\n\n\nOverall, Half-Life is an game that, while it may not look pretty, still plays well and combined with an immersive atmosphere and well-told (albeit unoriginal,) plot, combines to create an enjoyable well-crafted, if a bit dated, experience.","December 3, 2014","true","33.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I barely knew anything about FPS games on PC. When I was only familiar with Survival Horror games as tank controlled models in 3d environments. Until I played Counter strike with a couple of friends. Some friendships were lost and others were born from that game. A couple of LAN parties later, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to click on "Play Half Life" Thinking it was a demo for an upcoming multiplayer shooter. I did not know what was in store. I don't think anyone was ready for what Half Life offered, really. I need to emphasize on the fact that throughout my very first 5 to 6 hours, I still thought it was a demo. Headcrabs, crowbars, bleeding scientists running amok, these images still flash before me until today. It feels like yesterday when I tried to pass through the hallway only to get sucked up by a pod infested thing. I think the scariest moment for me was fighting that huge boss from afar, I cant recall his name but the whole experience with Half life was haunting. Only 2 games did I play as a kid where I was literally walking step by step. One was Silent Hill 2, the other was Half Life. By today you should already know what Half Life represents and what it influenced.

However, I'm reviewing this for the people like me who never played this game when they were younger. So I want to answer the question. Is this game still worth a buy and a play in 2015?\n\nSo, a problem I seemed to have from the outset is that this game just assumes you know things, or you know the games concepts and mechanics already. There is never a tutorial of any type and in fact I got stuck for a solid 10 minutes at the very start of the game because I simply didn't know you could press "e" on people to make them follow you. Like, really? The game never told me I could do that. That is just one example of the game just assuming you know how to play.\n\nSecondly, if you really look at this game. In essence, it is a very repetitive shooter. You pretty much do the same thing throughout the whole game from the first hour to the tenth hour. It didn't make me bored, but I can imagine it might make some people very bored.\n\nLet me just add, THIS GAME IS HARD. Like, really really hard. I played on normal, and, oh my god. Just expect to die a lot. Over and over again to the same section, and throughout many sections in the entire game. It was at some points frustratingly difficult as I would find myself saving progress every 30 seconds at some points just because this try I did a little better and didn't lose too much health.\n\nHOWEVER, that is the gem in this game. Because it was so difficult. It made me so happy to finally get past sections and eventually complete the game. I actually felt a sense of achievement beating this. Like a "I beat half life!!!" That is what gaming should be all about and it's a shame most AAA games lack that these days.\n\nSo, although this game has aged a lot, and elements are very outdated and in some circumstances, quite frankly, pretty awful. That doesn't take away from this game. This is a good game. I believe this game was enjoyable enough to still be worth a buy and play even in 2015.","October 1, 2015","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PascalPascal/recommended/70/","PascalPascal","Pascal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PascalPascal/","256 products in account","This game is a masterpiece. I'm pretty sure I'm not the first to say that, but it really feels like one. Many things in this game make it what it is. First, the gameplay in this game is just marvelous, you can't feel closer to the game with his amazing mechanisms, shooting, jumping and everything you can do, it just feels right. It seems like it's really you that control the game and that the final result, good or bad, is always the product of your moves. With a great shooting and movement mechanism, everything feels right.\n\nSecondly, another thing you can't complain about this game, its story. The story of Half-Life, the one that gave birth to this amazing franchise, is just a beautiful piece of work. It fully accomplishes its mission to take you to another world. With the fact that, Gordon Freeman, the character which you control, is entirely in your possession feels like you are in this story and you have to power to change it. The game doesn't even have cutscenes so everything is seen from your point of view. The story is captivating with the reasons that it treats the alien subject differently from most stories told on this subject. It contains a government conflict trying to hide the alien-incident, a mysterious G-Man, the man who watches you and with the discovery of the alien world which makes you realize some secrets about them. Maybe after all, they're not what we thought... So many questions will fly in your head and will give you the desire to continue this mysterious story.\n\nThirdly, I have to talk about the graphics and the level design. Those both, like everything I said before, are just truly great. While the graphics may be considered "ugly" or "old" are for me still beautiful even if this game is from 1998. With great details, textures and colors. Imagine how it felt back in those days. For the level-design, nothing as changed, what I mean by that is even after more than a decade, the levels are still pure genius and are so well used that you need to think and to familiarize with it so you use them as your advantage. I have to tell you that this game isn't like most of games today and his longer, which gives is better for you considering you want this game to last with all its qualities. There is also a multiplayer mode which can be fun, but, as you guessed, is mostly dead.\n\nFrom a negative point of view, I don't have a lot to say. For the people that won't like the graphics, you can always buy the source version which is the same thing, but updated with the Source engine. Maybe some guys will get bored after some time, but even with that, this game offers you so much originality and difference in every level, it won't feel the same twice. All I can say to end this is that this game is definitely worth your money.","July 3, 2014","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I barely knew anything about FPS games on PC. When I was only familiar with Survival Horror games as tank controlled models in 3d environments. Until I played Counter strike with a couple of friends. Some friendships were lost and others were born from that game. A couple of LAN parties later, my curiosity got the better of me and I decided to click on "Play Half Life" Thinking it was a demo for an upcoming multiplayer shooter. I did not know what was in store. I don't think anyone was ready for what Half Life offered, really. I need to emphasize on the fact that throughout my very first 5 to 6 hours, I still thought it was a demo. Headcrabs, crowbars, bleeding scientists running amok, these images still flash before me until today. It feels like yesterday when I tried to pass through the hallway only to get sucked up by a pod infested thing. I think the scariest moment for me was fighting that huge boss from afar, I cant recall his name but the whole experience with Half life was haunting. Only 2 games did I play as a kid where I was literally walking step by step. One was Silent Hill 2, the other was Half Life. By today you should already know what Half Life represents and what it influenced. If you haven't played it, I don't need to tell you what you need to do.","May 24, 2015","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/polina_lis/recommended/70/","polina_lis","Google Chrome","http://steamcommunity.com/id/polina_lis/","51 products in account","What's the first thing that comes to mind, when reviewing a video game? Well, for me, it has to be the visual world that captures the core of our imaginations. And with this little gem called Half-Life, it's no exception that this game continues to boggle the mind and leave people wondering. There is more heart, creativity and scientific ingenuity there is in this one title than there is in most series and is arguably Valve's greatest achievement. (With over 50 game awards, it's a strong justification). Half-Life isn't just one of the greatest FPS games of all time. It's not because Half-Life is one of the best purchases you can ever get on Steam. Half-Life is quite simply, one of the greatest games ever made.\n\nWhen compared to certain FPS games in the past and modern times, which both heavily rely on long-winded cutscenes to glorify the main plotline, Half-Life annihilates this compulsed aspect, by detailing the plotlines that keeps the player still in control of the first-person viewpoint, leaving the cutscenes rolling while you still have full access to the gameplay and character controllability. For clarification, You will see through the eyes of Gordon Freeman at all times.\n\nThe game is a constant puzzle; leaving the player to work at tasks that involve being locked into battle and overall puzzle solving to advance through the many challenges that wait up ahead. Most of the time, the story illuminates the puzzles by the actions to proceed, such as maze scenarios and building boxes to use as staircases. Though Half-Life has short-lived loading screens from time to time after leaving a certain area for a new one, the game has no levels. But, to make up for this traditional concept, the game is split into a number of mind-boggling chapters filled with rich story glory.\n\nTo start off with this game's story, you're none other than Gordon Freeman. A young man who holds a Ph.D in theoretical physics who starts his daily grind back at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that is stranded in a remote desert located in the suburbs of New Mexico. Arriving late for work yet again, you take the tram system around the Black Mesa Research Facility and at this point, objectives that his game has fulfilled such as breath-taking visuals and movie quality animation begins to blossom. The tram sequence at the beginning of the game can only be summed up in one word; Incredible. It's as if the things that come flying at you from every angle and position, almost reminiscent of watching an action-packed movie, along with the credits of the producer's names proudly fading in and out on the corner of the screen.\n\nAs you make your first step in the heavily secured facility, you're constantly reminded that you put on your Hazardous Enviromental suit, or the H.E.V suit for short. While all things are hunky-dory, those things soon turn to the worst very soon. After a failed experiment, involving a collision between a rare intergalactic specimen from another dimension with an Anti-Mass Spectrometer, the Black Mesa facility falls in ruins, meaning you are one of the only key survivors of the infamous ''Black Mesa Incident''. And with this, alien life-forms from the dimension of ''Xen'' are pulled from their dimension into ours and are running amok the ruined facility, along with the Army that storm the place after the gone, haywired facility's emergency call has been echoed. This of course doesn't make things any easier and you soon find yourself battling both the aliens and army.\n\nWhile there isn't exactly much to complain about, I would admit that guiding the chickened-out scientists and professors around the facility can be quite a pain now and again, as well as the alien life-form, Vortigaunt, from which you would have to wait and be patient for them to wreck down wooden doors in front of you, as you are not capable of doing that yourself. (You do start off with a crowbar, right?) As well as I'm probably not the only one who made the same mistake by killing them through a small opening, before they did in fact begin to tear down the doors. But then again, this is where the used scripted intermissions started to show, so that's an added bonus.\n\nFor the long run, I've had fun and joy both reviewing this amazing game and playing this amazing game. If you haven't play Half-Life and you're not familiar with Half-Life, it's still a massive recommendation from me.","January 18, 2015","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Boy was I mistaken.\n\nIn this game, you play as Morgan Freeman, a mentally challenged, mute, scientist with heavy military experience working at Black Mamba research labs, when the mysterious character "Walter White" or "W-Man" gives the lab a Blue Crystal to "experiment" with, you open up an interdimensional portal to try and kill all your coworkers for being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to simply for showing up 30 minutes late. You succeed, and all hell breaks loose.\n\nThe military also shows up to try and kill me for saying "Bush did 9/11" on the internet that one time, and you have to violently massacre them all just for doing their job. Although I did like Morgan Freeman's catchphrases, such as "Science rules!" or "It's cloberin' time!" Although that was it's only saving grace.\n\nAll in all, this was terrible, and violent adaptation of a family board game. I never even got to the section where I choose if I want to go to college or not. Don't waste your hard-earned allowence money like I did, go to wal-mart, and purchase the full board game version, "Life." Take my word for it, video games and violence do not mix well.","April 3, 2015","true","73.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","2","2","3","20"

Although I prefer the Portal Series (and HL2 was far surperior to its predecessor), this game still deserves the praise it gets. I'll be honest, this game's controls haven't aged the best; everything is slippery and way too fast. But, with a game from '98, that is to be expected. Despite minor hiccups in the control department, everything else checks out: the graphics look great for the time and still look good today, the story is interesting (even if it's rarely explained), and it can be very challenging at times.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/piratepony/recommended/70/","piratepony","MisturPandaa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/piratepony/","17 products in account","Half-Life I was a game I'd heard a lot about, but I had neer played anything like it (the closest was probably 007: Goldeneye, so I wasn't quite certain of what I was getting into at first, but the Half-Life collection was on sale for only some $15, so I figured I'd take a risk.\nAnd I'm so glad I did.  I decided, on a whim, to play it on its hardest difficulty, and I recommend you do the same, because it's just hard enough to make you be really careful, but not so hard to bring you to throw your controller across the room.\nI'll address my thoughts on Half-Life I in the tradition of YouTube reviewer The Completionist:\n\nStory 9/10\nA la Zelda I, story takes a backseat in Half Life I, and I personally really like that.  There IS a story, but unlike in so many triple-A titles, it doesn't demand so much attention that the rest is neglected.  The story that exists can basically be summed up like this:\nYou are Gordon Freeman, a scientist with special training in the use of a power-augmenting suit, working in a top-secret facility known as Black Mesa.  After an experiment goes horribly wrong, alien creatures with no greater purpose than to kill and infect humans begin appearing around the facility, and you, as one of the only able-bodied people alive, must fight your way out of the death trap that Black Mesa has become.  But along the way, you notice a mysterious man watching your every move...\nAnd that's it.  Most of the developments throughout the game are finding out one teensy little detail about Black Mesa's past through a stray word in normal dialogue or through coming across the aforementioned mysterious figure who watches you throughout the game.\nI love it.  Having the story be so simple lets the gameplay and puzzles take a much larger role in my mind.  Instead of thinking to myself, "I have to get past this puzzle so that I can know what happened to Jim," I'm thinking "hmm...if I only have 27 health and I need to get past the lightning-throwing alien with only two bullets in my revolver, how quick will I need to fire?  And how close should I get?  Are there more enemies around him?  Maybe I could sneak past him and find a stock of ammo..." and so on.  The game prompts the player to think so much, in part because you're playing it not for the story but for the puzzles.\nThat is, in my opinion, one of Half-Life I's strongest points.  However, I don't give it a 10/10 for story because I feel like it could be just a little bit more engaging.  If it were as engaging as Portal I in story, it would be absolutely perfect.\n\nGameplay 9.8/10\nThis game is so damn fun to play.  The controls, at least for PC, are fantastic, because you can make them be whatever the crap you want.  Because it's an FPS, you NEED to have a mouse, but what self-respecting gamer doesn't?  (Unless you like to make games harder by playing them without a mouse on purpose, in which case, props to you.)  Like I said in the "Story" section, gameplay takes an incredibly important role in this game, and was absolutely perfected.\nOne of the reasons for this is that the gameplay is so simple.  You can jump, you can shoot/use various weapons, you can crouch, and you can use a flashlight.  That's it.  No silly quick-time events, no complicated set of moves, no vast arrays of powers, just jumping, weapons, crouching, and flashlight.\nWhat gives the game depth from here is the plethora of different weapons you can get.  No weapon is similar in more than one way, and every one has different strengths and weaknesses.  Basically, no one weapon is "the best"; even the strongest weapon in the game, the lazer gun, is balanced out because you can have an absolute maximum of 60 shots, and because it fires so rapidly, it's easy to use more ammo than you needed to.  My favorite weapon by far is the revolver, because it has a nice sound, it reloads fast, and it does great damage.  It's big drawbacks, however, are that ammo for it is very scarce, and so must be well-conserved, and it has pretty slow firing time.  And all weapons are like that: the crowbar is the weakest weapon, and must be used up close, but it uses no ammo and so has no reload time; the machine gun has the fastest firing and reload times, and can double as a grenade launcher if you have ammo for it, but really low damage and is hard to aim; the rocket launcher deals enormous damage, but can easily kill you, has terrible reload and firing time, ammo is scarce, and the shots automatically will fly around and hit nothing if you don't get reasonably close to your enemy; and the list goes on and on.\nSomehow, Half Life I gives you a wide array of interesting and equally useful weapons to use in the different situations it puts you in.  Every weapon has strengths and weaknesses, every one is useful in different situations, and any could end up your favorite without that impacting your enjoyment of the game.\nThe only reason I don't give gameplay a 10/10 is because the rocket launcher's rockets are the biggest pain in the butt to hit anything with.\n\nPresentation 10/10\nThis game was revolutionary for its time, and still looks great.  It's not COD: AW, but I like that it doesn't need to use the crutch of HD graphics like some games.  The music is fantastic, and used sparingly, which helps a ton with the mood, because you'll know when something important is happening just because of music playing.  There isn't much to say here, because it's not something you really notice, but overall, the presentation is perfect.\n\nTrue Completionist fans are expecting me to move on to the final component of his reviewing style, the final level, but the problem is, I haven't gotten there yet.  I just wanted to post this review now, and I might come back and edit it later to add the "Final Level" portion if I feel like it.  (But no promises; I probably won't.)\n\nOverall: 9.6/10\nVerdict: What the hell are you waiting for?  BUY IT!!!","November 26, 2014","true","113.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They're very dated, and sit somewhere in between Playstation and Playstation 2, but don't let this turn you off from this classic. I originally bought this just to fill the gap in story before Half Life 2, but found it to be an extremely fun and intermittently terrifying old-school survival horror FPS. This comes complete with the ability to Friendly-fire on any civillian you wish and enemies you'll come to hate, placed so strategically as to force you to go away from the health pack you desperately need because you don't have enough health to face them in the first place.","March 8, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You're not a space marine: you're a scientist fighting for your life. You truly feel alone when your only companion--be it a scientist or one of the many security guards trapped with you--bites the dust, leaving you to fend for yourself. Seamlessly flowing from cinematics to action, there are no cutscenes: the control is never taken from you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PascalPascal/recommended/70/","PascalPascal","Pascal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PascalPascal/","256 products in account","This game is a masterpiece. I'm pretty sure I'm not the first to say that, but it really feels like one. Many things in this game make it what it is. First, the gameplay in this game is just marvelous, you can't feel closer to the game with his amazing mechanisms, shooting, jumping and everything you can do, it just feels right. It seems like it's really you that control the game and that the final result, good or bad, is always the product of your moves. With a great shooting and movement mechanism, everything feels right.\n\nSecondly, another thing you can't complain about this game, its story. The story of Half-Life, the one that gave birth to this amazing franchise, is just a beautiful piece of work. It fully accomplishes its mission to take you to another world. With the fact that, Gordon Freeman, the character which you control, is entirely in your possession feels like you are in this story and you have to power to change it. The game doesn't even have cutscenes so everything is seen from your point of view. The story is captivating with the reasons that it treats the alien subject differently from most stories told on this subject. It contains a government conflict trying to hide the alien-incident, a mysterious G-Man, the man who watches you and with the discovery of the alien world which makes you realize some secrets about them. Maybe after all, they're not what we thought... So many questions will fly in your head and will give you the desire to continue this mysterious story.\n\nThirdly, I have to talk about the graphics and the level design. Those both, like everything I said before, are just truly great. While the graphics may be considered "ugly" or "old" are for me still beautiful even if this game is from 1998. With great details, textures and colors. Imagine how it felt back in those days. For the level-design, nothing as changed, what I mean by that is even after more than a decade, the levels are still pure genius and are so well used that you need to think and to familiarize with it so you use them as your advantage. I have to tell you that this game isn't like most of games today and his longer, which gives is better for you considering you want this game to last with all its qualities. There is also a multiplayer mode which can be fun, but, as you guessed, is mostly dead.\n\nFrom a negative point of view, I don't have a lot to say. For the people that won't like the graphics, you can always buy the source version which is the same thing, but updated with the Source engine. Maybe some guys will get bored after some time, but even with that, this game offers you so much originality and difference in every level, it won't feel the same twice. All I can say to end this is that this game is definitely worth your money.","July 3, 2014","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The environments are varied, from office complexes in Black Mesa to experimental labs, to a low-gravity alien realm. The weapons are realistic and easy to use; the crowbar splinters boxes and fractures skulls as it should - the pistol is weedy, but a welcome addition, grenades are thrown as they should, and the shotgun is satisfyingly powerful. The later weapons are brilliant, with my favourite of the gauss gun, which can charge up and take out helicopters if you do it just right. The guns are acquired at a good pace, although you don't get the most powerful one until very late in the game, which feels like a shame.\nIt's tremendously absorbing - you really feel immersed in the levels. The music helps, but it's a bit sporadic - you'll get some great music when you're coming up to a key bit, and then it'll die down.\nWhile there is variety of landscape and it is excellently created-the bareness of the offices and labs except of monsters and the general coldness of the facility as well as the chilling music creates a dark, sorrowful atmosphere. Your almost complete loneliness (apart from the occasional scientist or security guard) is capped by the chilling messages inscribed on the wall, 'Surrender, Freeman.' 'Freeman your dead' by the military.","December 2, 2015","true","11.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This is the game that got me into Valve in 2004, I believe (I first played this on PS2, a while after RtCW on Xbox).\n\nHowever, I do not recommend buying this game by itself - buy one of the bundles. The Half-Life Complete bundle is $40, but comes with 11 games (1. Half-Life 1 2. Opposing Force 3. Blue Shift 4. Half-Life Source 5. Half-Life Deathmatch Source 6. Half-Life 2 7. Episode 1 8.

All of the sudden he jump on my face and i died. Half life 1 is the exact definition of "nerd rage", in this game you are basicly a nerd who got mad because your science team mess up with your science project and he start to kill everything and everyone! He loves to troll his coworkers and also kill them in the most horrible ways possible.

While it's not the best FPS, it's definitely one of the best. Valve's finest creation to date! It's a long, challenging game and will keep you entertained for years to come. This is the game that got me into Valve in 2004, I believe (I first played this on PS2, a while after RtCW on Xbox).\n\nHowever, I do not recommend buying this game by itself - buy one of the bundles. The Half-Life Complete bundle is $40, but comes with 11 games (1. Half-Life 1 2. Opposing Force 3. Blue Shift 4. Half-Life Source 5. Half-Life Deathmatch Source 6. Half-Life 2 7. Episode 1 8. Episode 2 9\nHalf-Life 2 Deathmatch 10. Half-Life 2 Lost Coast 11. Team Fortress Classic). Deathmatch Source and Lost Coast don't appear in the bundle contents, but they're still added to your library. The other bundle, Half-Life 1 Anthology, comes with Half-Life and it's two expansion packs (Opposing Force and Blue Shift) for only $5 extra. Considering the expansions are $5 a pop, you get one for free by buying it that way.","February 14","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/_surmA_/recommended/70/","_surmA_","surmA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/_surmA_/","87 products in account","I give this game a 8.5/10 overall.\n\n-The "story" is great even there is lack of information. The story is that a experiment goes wrong which opens a portal and aliens destroy the whole facility, the player needs to kill aliens and close the portal to save the day.\n\n-The gamplay is for me 7.5/10 because sometimes the directions are unclear and what you need to do is sometimes hard to understand. For example I got to a area which had many enemies and very little health packs, I found myself frustrated dying over and over again. in the same area a npc got stuck in a door and he needed to help me open a door (where health packs and ammo was found in), I had to consult a online guide to understand what I needed to do. Sometimes I got stuck in objects and sometimes the game crashed.\n\n-The graphics are "bad" (by todays standards) but dosent affect the gameplay, I really didnt notice the fact that they are "bad" and still enjoyed the game.\n\n-Otherwise I think the game is great and I highly recommend it to people a great game.","February 13","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Your main goal, The Joker, who in this game is controlling all the Justice men to destroy the earth.\n\nNear the end of the game, North Korea invades in hopes to stop the X-men from foiling the plans of the United Nations from going to Krypton and destroying mother brain.\n\nSuch a diverse and amazing plot could only be brought up by the greatest minds behinds Archie comics, and what's really amazing was that this game was made in 1827! Such brilliance for such an old game, I give it a 7/11 its a good part time job, but only in the day, cuz at night there's a better chance the game will come outside your computer and jack all your money, and spend it all on hats for Halo 3","March 9","true","15.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/satanlicious/recommended/70/","satanlicious","satanlicious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/satanlicious/","45 products in account","I'll be honest; I didn't love Half-Life at first.\n\nMaybe it was the fact that I played this game in 2016, 18 years after its initial release in 1998. Perhaps it was the serviceable but definitely outdated controls  I had to deal with, along with some annoying bugs and glitches. It didn't click for me. But after about an hour of getting used to everything, here's what I realized: Half-Life is real nice. Almost everything wrong with the game comes from technological limitations of the 90s. Graphics really start to show the wear-and-tear of 18 years; but they aren't bad enough to distract from the general gameplay.\n\nI can't make any more complaints about Half-Life simply because the sum of its parts makes it such a good game. The story still entertains and is delivered well, throwing out lengthy cutscenes and text crawls in favor of gameplay-based storytelling. Enemy AI was amazing for its time and still functions well today; a variety of weapons and unique, challenging level designs keep things interesting through the course of this game. Most importantly, Half-Life retains a remarkable sense of immersion. You do things of your own volition - you never feel like the game is telling you to do something.\n\nThe best and most surprising aspect of this is its genuine difficulty. Make no mistake about it, scrubs: Half-Life is HARD. The game will throw you in tough situations that make you get off your silly high horse and think; try to play this game with the Doom mentality of run-and-gun and you'll get instantly wrecked by its puzzles and smart enemy placement. Playing through Half-Life in 2016 was a chore; it was a struggle. Most importantly, though? It was a genuinely fascinating, enjoyable little 10+ hour trip into the world of an FPS that revolutionized EVERYTHING in the world of video games upon its release. If it were remastered and retweaked today (read: Black Mesa), it would still be one of the best shooters of any generation of gaming.\n\nA definite must-play if you want to stop being a filthy scrub.\nRating: 7 spooky alien baby-heads out of 10.","January 10","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Early \'99 maybe? Anyway...... The hours you see logged for this game under Steam are WAY off. I didn\'t make the switch from WON to Steam until it was forced on us in 2004.\n\nWhat to say about the game itself.... put simply; it\'s AMAZING! When I saw the initial opening scenes..... I was blown away.\n\n16 years later, I\'m still playing it, and I still find it a bit of a challenge.\n\nHalf Life re-defined the FPS genre, and in such a positive way, it is still selling. It can be argued that the graphics are dated, and perhapse they are. Personally, I don\'t think so. I think they are as much a part of the game as the abilities you get as Gordon Freeman.\n\nHalf Life won over 50 Game of the Year awards, and rightly so. If you enjoy FPS games, and this game isn\'t in your collection..... GET IT! It has a great blend of action, stuff to destroy, things to make you think, and lots of hidden Easter Eggs.\n\n","June 1","true","296.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Still get it\n\nLong version: It's a well-made game, and it's very clever in terms of the gameplay (i.e. boss fights are a bit more complicated than in most games, you have to think around the location of the fight, not the "health" of the boss persay). The graphics are as good as they need to be, they may seem a bit dated, but they're still good. Really, my only problem with this game is that it's very gimmicky and way overhyped (I could say the same about half-life 2). Is it a great shooter? yes. One of the best of it's era? Sure. The best shooter ever? God no! I personally enjoyed games like doom and Bioshock more, because they don't try to skirt around the fun of shooting things with how "groundbreaking" they are get in the way of their fun.\n\nGeneral pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n+ It's a good shooter\n+ well-done setpieces that involve the player\n+ Great worldbuilding\n+ Good piece of gaming history\n+ Varied and interesting gamplay\n\nCons:\n- Slow paced\n- Unfair at times\n- Breeds a fanbase prone to overhyping it\n\nWorth the purchase on sale or bundled with the expansions","May 23","true","18.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Team Fortress, Counter-Strike and countless amounts of other mods. It had become a hallmark of FPS quality for many years to come until Half-Life 2 came out to raise the bar even higher. This legendary status helps to alleviate the ravages of time the graphics have suffered. But, as any Counter-Strike player will tell you, it is not that bad considering the age of the game, it's still approachable for younger players. The game's design is very variable and interactive, which cannot be said about a myriad of modern shooters. The remarkable sound and authentic music will help to create a memorable, mysterious, sci-fi atmosphere. Xen, being the most criticized part of the game, seemed quite enjoyable to me. It offers a much needed diversion from the rest of the game, most of which takes place in steel corridors. This game represents a milestone, thanks to which a series of events lead to the creation of our beloved Steam.

Half-Life is a classic.\nYou are a scientist called Gordon Freeman. One day you are involved in a critical test which goes terribly wrong and opens portals to the boarderland Xen. From that moment on, aliens invade earth and you find yourself in chaos and try to get out alive.\n\nThe singleplayer was revolutionary at the time because it has a continious story without cutscenes. I also like that there are a lot of enemy-types. The weapons are all really balanced (except gluongun) and fun to use. The story develops as you proceed in the game. It gets more and more mysterious and suspense.\nIn Half-Life you are mostly on your own and travel through many interessting environments. Sometimes the maps can be a bit confusing but in the end you will have a nice final and it feels great to finish the game.\n\nIn my opinion Half-Life's multiplayer is very very good. I played it a very long time and it has a great learning-curve. In Half-Life you have very dynamic gameplay with fast movement, air-control, excessive wallbanging and spawnkilling. It can be a really great feel to dominate and control the whole map. In Half-Life you can play many styles.. aggressive like a berserker but also slow and silent. It's possible to break the enemies advantage by clever ambushing and by hitting well aimed headshots. Since there are many different weapons you can always find different ways to deal with your enemy. Each weapon is very different and good in special situations. Also the maps are all very different to each other. Each map has it's own great design and unique gameplay.\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend you to try Half-Life on LAN with friends, because it's a lot of fun to play against enemies of equal skill. Since it has a great learning-curve you have to get into the game a bit.\nIf you want to play online I recommend you to edit your config-file so you can have a field of view of 110 degrees and direct weapon-bindings. On most servers (Adrenaline Gamer Mod) you can use bunnyhop. Since they patched Half-Life you are no longer able to code bunnyhop-scripts in your config. So if you want a working bhop you have to use a macro programm like autohotkey or maybe your keyboard-driver. The other easier way to use bhop is to disable automatic updates and patch back half-life to an older version (still works online).\nHalf-Life has a lot of mods and there is a lot of custom content (player and weapon-models, maps, effects and hud-elements). I recommend you to install good visible custom crosshairs and use simple explosion sprites.\nRegarding mods I can recommend you Adrenaline Gamer, Sven-Coop 3.0 (because it has the original Half-Life weapons and basicly is a coop mod for Half-Life), The Specialists (a Matrix-styled mod) and Frontline Force.\nThere are also a lot great singleplayer mods. I can recommend you Half-Life Invasion, Escape from the Darkness, Paranoia, Todesangst, ETC 1 and 2, Sweet Half-Life and a lot more.\nSeriously there are a lot good mods out there..\nAll in all for me this game is a must have. So if you don't mind the old graphics and take some time to understand the game.. I think you will like it!","August 13, 2013","true","378.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's possible to break the enemies advantage by clever ambushing and by hitting well aimed headshots. Since there are many different weapons you can always find different ways to deal with your enemy. Each weapon is very different and good in special situations. Also the maps are all very different to each other. Each map has it's own great design and unique gameplay.\n\nConclusion:\nI recommend you to try Half-Life on LAN with friends, because it's a lot of fun to play against enemies of equal skill. Since it has a great learning-curve you have to get into the game a bit.\nIf you want to play online I recommend you to edit your config-file so you can have a field of view of 110 degrees and direct weapon-bindings. On most servers (Adrenaline Gamer Mod) you can use bunnyhop. Since they patched Half-Life you are no longer able to code bunnyhop-scripts in your config. So if you want a working bhop you have to use a macro programm like autohotkey or maybe your keyboard-driver. The other easier way to use bhop is to disable automatic updates and patch back half-life to an older version (still works online).\nHalf-Life has a lot of mods and there is a lot of custom content (player and weapon-models, maps, effects and hud-elements). I recommend you to install good visible custom crosshairs and use simple explosion sprites.\nRegarding mods I can recommend you Adrenaline Gamer, Sven-Coop 3.0 (because it has the original Half-Life weapons and basicly is a coop mod for Half-Life), The Specialists (a Matrix-styled mod) and Frontline Force.\nThere are also a lot great singleplayer mods. I can recommend you Half-Life Invasion, Escape from the Darkness, Paranoia, Todesangst, ETC 1 and 2, Sweet Half-Life and a lot more.\nSeriously there are a lot good mods out there..\nAll in all for me this game is a must have. So if you don't mind the old graphics and take some time to understand the game.. I think you will like it!","August 13, 2013","true","378.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

While it's story never breaks line from Gordon's perspective, they don't elaborate on any of the characters or enviroments at all, making interaction with scientists and guards either "keep them alive" or "waste them for laughs".\n\nLevel design, however, is this games strong point. Every map is huge and expansive, with some great texture work for a game released in 1998. The Dam scene remains one of my favorite uses of Quake II engine technology to this day.\n\nIt's basically Quake 2 in lab settings. The most interesting chapter is probably Xen, with it's bizarre landscapes.\n\nMultiplayer isn't horrible.\n\n7/10 it's good","June 14, 2014","true","5.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Half Life also has extensive DLC content to add to the overall game\n\nThe Original Half Life gets a 9/10. You get get this game along with the Half Life Collection for $5 when on sale.

The game can be difficult espically at times when coming to some parts (unless your on easy) making that feel good when you complete it too. The soundtrack is a good part of this game too, and by good, I mean amazingly good. Some of my favorite songs in the game are the following: Hazardous Enviroments, Nuclear Mission Jam, Klaxon Beat, Diabolical Adrenaline Guitar, and Jungle Drums.

It hasn't aged that well, unlike it's successor. Glitches in the single player campaign can be very annoying, but if you like old games, you must play this. It's a very long game, has little focus on story, so the action is nonstop as you travel trough a lot of different environments, the gameplay never gets boring. And if you already played Black Mesa Source, I still recommend this just because of the multiplayer.\nThe multiplayer is very unique and fun. The different kinds of alien weaponry and the possibility to use some of then to move and jump around makes it very hard to master. I always return to play it because the multiplayer on modern war games always bores me, trying to be realistic and balanced, while in Half-Life you just make a mess with ridiculously overpowered weapons and movement mechanics, it's fast, it's awesome. Half-Life 2 Deathmatch was just not the same in comparison. If Valve decides to make Half-Life 3's multiplayer just like the first game, with more maps, more overpowered alien weapons, faster movement, and a remake of the crossfire map, it will be the best multiplayer game ever, outselling all Call of Duty games combined.","April 23, 2014","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I played the game, it was sad to see how old the game has become. Nonetheless, this is the game to shatter all games for almost a decade.\nVideo games have so much to owe to Half-Life, every single FPS that has come out since then, owes something to Half-life.\nIf you played Half-Life rather thoughtlessly, you may think that the game is seriously overrated, but the story, the dialouge, and the characters in Half-Life are very subtle. Don't expect this game to parade itself as the best PC game of all time. It's modest that way.\nWe can't really say much about the graphics or sound or the character models of Half-Life, as this game IS from 1998, but this game is big where is counts. The gameplay is solid, the story is quiet, - yet brilliant - and the level design is incredible. If you want to know how to make the best game the world has ever seen, go to Half-Life. I wish game designers of today would use this as a model, because you just don't get better.\nI may be raving about how great the game is, and in that case I have something BAD to say about it...\nI hate the bloody ladders in this game.","January 10, 2015","true","32.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The player you play as is Dr. Gordon "Freeman", A scientist who works at a research facility called Black Mesa. He is a part of a experiment there that went horribly wrong, a resonance cascade occurs, causing portals between Earth and a alien world called Xen to intersect, causing aliens from Xen to attack Black Mesa! Dr. Freeman now must find a way out of Black Mesa by fighting his way through hordes of aliens. The action in the game is great, there are 14 weapons in the game, you start small then you work you're way up to a rocket launcher! First: you start off with a crowbar, then you get a simple pistol, then a shotgun, and then a SMG,etc. The storytelling is great, I wont try to give any spoilers, but the military will "intervene". Also, at some points you will have to think to survive, for example: you find a mounted gun later on in the game, and there will be a horde of aliens that you must kill to pass on you will have to think which alien is about to shoot at you or which alien is closest to you, Even though Half-Life is a old game it's still a game that lives up to it's title to this very day, so I recommend everybody to play this game :D, good luck at Black Mesa, you will need it. *salutes*","August 9, 2014","true","68.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the Black Mesa scientific research and developemt facility (Interesting Banter: Black Mesa roughly translates to Black Table, with Mesa meaning Table in spanish. #TheMoreYouKnow) Gordon Freeman, age 27, inadvertently causes the apocalypse, when a rare crystal found from the facility's experiments with teleportation is places under a super-powered analyzer, which then overloads and opens a wormhole to an alien dimension full of creatures that leech onto your head and gain control over your body, creating zombies.\nLost intrest yet? No? Good.\nArmed with a crowbar, a mech suit, and a series of shooty-shooty bang bang tubes, you face the onslaught, prepared to get to the surface and call for help. Does this go well? Buy the game and see.*\n\nThis game is old. Like, 1998 old. But when it came out, it revolutionalised the gaming industry with it's unique storytelling and gameplay style. It is a first person shooter that will be remembered for years to come, despite it being 16 next month.\n\nHowever, this game can be PUNISHINGLY dificult, especiallly in later levels. No doubt will you find yourself wishing you'd picked an easier difficulty at some point in the game.\nHaving said this, though, Half Life is still damn enjoyable, even to this day.\n\nVerdict: This is a damn fine shooter.\n8/10. Would happily play again and again a few times.\n\n*SPOILERS  The US Army intend to neutralize the threat by killing every living, undead, and alien thing in the facility, It's fun. You get to shoot the same 3 soldier models over and over. :D","September 22, 2014","true","30.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Now, when I start playing it, I felt that this game has alot of riches and opprtunities that everyone will enjoy and no wonder Half-Life 1 has over 50 Game of the Year Awards.\n\nFirst is for the pros, which this game has alot of them, the backstory and the characters behind the game are interesting, the gameplay is enjoyable and I have a good time with powerful weapons and the graphics are so breathtaking such as the canyon scene I saw, it was very unique and cool and for the planet Xen, I cannot believe that world was so out of place and drag me in behind the bizarre biological life that the aliens have. For the best part is that it doesn't feel the modern Call of Duty games such as Black Ops and Modern Warfare, its a different character as being a  scientist not a hardcore soldier that's how it is for this game, it's uniquely different and the Half-Life experience is totally out of this world.\n\nWell, its not perfect, there are a few minor mistakes behind the game, sometimes when I interact with certain people and ask them to follow, they would rather stay in place and lose me whether I go and I became frustrated for it wastes time for my progression in the game. So, these were minor problems that Valve will improve throughout the new versions of Half-Life.\n\nIn the end, I got to say that this game definitely worths my time and money and I can't wait to enjoy other Half-Life expansions such as Opposing Force and Blue Shift. Also for its sequel, Half-Life 2 and it's remaining episodes, 1-2.\n\nFor the scale from 1 to 10, I'll give it a 10/10.\n","July 2, 2014","true","76.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Almost everything about this game is ahead of it's time. Gameplay, Graphics, and the AI. The guards in the Science lab (Black Mesa) follow you well, and do whatever they can to help you, and their not Half-Bad at it. (Bad pun) The roaches flock to dead bodies, and run away from you, and your flashlight for example. And the military forces distract and then flank you too, which adds some difficulty. This game will occasionally laugh in your face while you try to do something to progress, but it's okay because even though you usually end up dying in the end of the trick, there is usually an autosave just before the trick to give you the chance to correct your mistake. You can also save whenever you want to, and load back to any of the saves you have made.And believe me, you might just need to do that a few times. Sometimes you got a part, and then you can't get past it because you have almost no health by the time you get there. But it's okay, this game is fun and satisfying. You can also make corpses explode with only a crowbar, and that alone is enough to make me get this game. 420/10\n\nAlso, for some reason, I think I was the only person in the world who actually dug around in the video settings a bit, and you can actually play through the whole game with better looking weapons with clear textures, and they look entirely different. And you can actually read the words BLACK MESA on the guards' badges. I played through the entirety of the game with the HD models, so when I saw playthroughs and screenshots of the game with people using the low quality models I was kind of confused.","May 2, 2014","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here you get to know how to the amazing universe of Half Life and Portal started and the consequences of the chain of events Gordon got himself into.\n\nA very bad aspect of the game is that many friendly human models and voices are the same throughout the game and said people will be torn to pieces and blasted full of holes and that somewhat gives a bizarre feeling and it makes a bit confusing to be able to tell who is the real Eli Vance and Kleiner but I guess technology was more limited back then.\n\nThe game itself tries to combine puzzles, shooting and a bit of sci-fi horror into a nice little mix. You might be trying to figure out how to turn on the water to some device but you know that when you go back to activate it you will to pass through those alien clawed tentacles of death or you will be having a flame throwing gargatuan on your tail and you have to see how to dispose of him while running like a mouse.\n\nSmall creatures will always be jumping on you and making you keep an eye out in every little hole and corner and the huge enemies will make you run and hide to safety giving that chasing sensation. In terms of enemy variety it’s a pretty nice selection going from generic army thugs and ninjas to energy shooting aliens, grunts that fire a barrage of homing “bees” to you and even vehicles and artillery strikes.\n\nEvery gun in here has its purpose, you want to explode a few barrels but not waste precious ammo? Use the normal gun. Want to see your enemies go up in pieces with some traps? Place some remote charges here and there and then cover the door ways in optic mines. A huge firefight got you trapped in a corner? Well thanks to a grenade barrel in your assault rifle you can noobtube your way out of trouble. But wait, massive ordinance is being deployed on poor little you? Well those huge aliens, tanks and helicopters won’t expect a guided missile on their face, or will they? In that case they should be no match for a charged radioactive shot or maybe your Gluon Hyper Beam that can rival the most legendary of Pokémon.\nIf all fails, nothing says DIE like a crowbar to the face.\n\nThere’s not much to say about the environments they are quite varied and include even ice parts and water parts where you will have to face the terrors of the deep with your “water usable” weapons only. Basically you go through offices, warehouses, factories, sewers a bit of desert canyon and at last the mysterious and bizarre Xen where everything came out of Gabe Newell’s fever dreams and rules of gravity allow you to be fabulous.\n\nTL;DR: You should play this, see how old things are done right  and explode the microwave casserole.\n","June 21, 2014","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's pretty high up there, but NOT at the top. (Grab your pitchforks!) Half-Life is the first installment into the series and does not fail to impress. With easy to look at and understand graphics and hands-down some of the finest crafted gameplay in any game i've ever played, this game is something I could replay anytime. Most of you should already know the story and its characters, only because its a Valve game, so i'll spare the story details. While playing through Half-Life, you may notice the crazy balance between ammo and limits. There are a lot of risk-taking moments and sometimes even have you leaving to backtrack for more ammo, which does not feel tedious at all. All interactions in this game are centered around YOU. It feels like you are important to this world, like you really are trying to save it. Overall it just makes for fine story-telling. As for Gordon himself and the way other characters perceive him, it just feels dumb. EVERY other character just feels like they are lower than you, which doesn't show a challenge in the story. I don't know if Valve tried to play a safe-route when it came to the story, but it disapointed me when you felt higher than everyone. It's like having a route, A to B. At B there is a super weapon that you need but instead of walking that route, the game just brings it to you and it does not feel so rewarding.\n\nThis game is great and highly enjoyable. I'd state my cons at more of a personal pinpoint, but it's really up to you on how you feel about it.","December 27, 2011","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Much has been said about HL and it's all true. Doom and Wolfenstein popularized the genre as a whole, and HL changed the way we saw level-design in FPS as a whole. A big, linear map and a background story made the game what it is and damn if it isn't one of the finest games out there. The game is cheap enough even outside sales, pick it up and enjoy one of the best games from generations before (just be careful of the underwater monster, heart-attack inducing ♥♥♥♥).","June 20, 2014","true","36.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Here you get to know how to the amazing universe of Half Life and Portal started and the consequences of the chain of events Gordon got himself into.\n\nA very bad aspect of the game is that many friendly human models and voices are the same throughout the game and said people will be torn to pieces and blasted full of holes and that somewhat gives a bizarre feeling and it makes a bit confusing to be able to tell who is the real Eli Vance and Kleiner but I guess technology was more limited back then.\n\nThe game itself tries to combine puzzles, shooting and a bit of sci-fi horror into a nice little mix. You might be trying to figure out how to turn on the water to some device but you know that when you go back to activate it you will to pass through those alien clawed tentacles of death or you will be having a flame throwing gargatuan on your tail and you have to see how to dispose of him while running like a mouse.\n\nSmall creatures will always be jumping on you and making you keep an eye out in every little hole and corner and the huge enemies will make you run and hide to safety giving that chasing sensation. In terms of enemy variety it’s a pretty nice selection going from generic army thugs and ninjas to energy shooting aliens, grunts that fire a barrage of homing “bees” to you and even vehicles and artillery strikes.\n\nEvery gun in here has its purpose, you want to explode a few barrels but not waste precious ammo? Use the normal gun. Want to see your enemies go up in pieces with some traps? Place some remote charges here and there and then cover the door ways in optic mines. A huge firefight got you trapped in a corner? Well thanks to a grenade barrel in your assault rifle you can noobtube your way out of trouble. But wait, massive ordinance is being deployed on poor little you? Well those huge aliens, tanks and helicopters won’t expect a guided missile on their face, or will they? In that case they should be no match for a charged radioactive shot or maybe your Gluon Hyper Beam that can rival the most legendary of Pokémon.\nIf all fails, nothing says DIE like a crowbar to the face.\n\nThere’s not much to say about the environments they are quite varied and include even ice parts and water parts where you will have to face the terrors of the deep with your “water usable” weapons only. Basically you go through offices, warehouses, factories, sewers a bit of desert canyon and at last the mysterious and bizarre Xen where everything came out of Gabe Newell’s fever dreams and rules of gravity allow you to be fabulous.\n\nTL;DR: You should play this, see how old things are done right  and explode the microwave casserole.\n","June 21, 2014","true","25.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player you play as is Dr. Gordon "Freeman", A scientist who works at a research facility called Black Mesa. He is a part of a experiment there that went horribly wrong, a resonance cascade occurs, causing portals between Earth and a alien world called Xen to intersect, causing aliens from Xen to attack Black Mesa! Dr. Freeman now must find a way out of Black Mesa by fighting his way through hordes of aliens. The action in the game is great, there are 14 weapons in the game, you start small then you work you're way up to a rocket launcher! First: you start off with a crowbar, then you get a simple pistol, then a shotgun, and then a SMG,etc. The storytelling is great, I wont try to give any spoilers, but the military will "intervene". Also, at some points you will have to think to survive, for example: you find a mounted gun later on in the game, and there will be a horde of aliens that you must kill to pass on you will have to think which alien is about to shoot at you or which alien is closest to you, Even though Half-Life is a old game it's still a game that lives up to it's title to this very day, so I recommend everybody to play this game :D, good luck at Black Mesa, you will need it. *salutes*","August 9, 2014","true","68.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the Black Mesa scientific research and developemt facility (Interesting Banter: Black Mesa roughly translates to Black Table, with Mesa meaning Table in spanish. #TheMoreYouKnow) Gordon Freeman, age 27, inadvertently causes the apocalypse, when a rare crystal found from the facility's experiments with teleportation is places under a super-powered analyzer, which then overloads and opens a wormhole to an alien dimension full of creatures that leech onto your head and gain control over your body, creating zombies.\nLost intrest yet? No? Good.\nArmed with a crowbar, a mech suit, and a series of shooty-shooty bang bang tubes, you face the onslaught, prepared to get to the surface and call for help. Does this go well? Buy the game and see.*\n\nThis game is old. Like, 1998 old. But when it came out, it revolutionalised the gaming industry with it's unique storytelling and gameplay style. It is a first person shooter that will be remembered for years to come, despite it being 16 next month.\n\nHowever, this game can be PUNISHINGLY dificult, especiallly in later levels. No doubt will you find yourself wishing you'd picked an easier difficulty at some point in the game.\nHaving said this, though, Half Life is still damn enjoyable, even to this day.\n\nVerdict: This is a damn fine shooter.\n8/10. Would happily play again and again a few times.\n\n*SPOILERS  The US Army intend to neutralize the threat by killing every living, undead, and alien thing in the facility, It's fun.

What a game we have here. Playing this in the year of 2013 (After having played the wonderful Half-Life 2 some time ago), it's still a joyful experience. The awesome narrative, level design, gunplay and even artificial intelligence still work very well, making it easy to see just how incredibly ahead of its time the game was. Some things that stood out for me in particular were the level design, which changed drastically throughout the game and helped to keep things fresh, the intense (still to this day!) combat, and especially the enemies. Not only were there many different types of enemies, each one interesting and with their very own methods of attack, but for 1998 they were an extremely intelligent bunch of baddies- especially the Special Forces soldiers, who are constantly flanking and lobbing grenades. Not only that, but I found the mini-puzzles to be quite entertaining. All in all, this is one heck of a game, and there's no wonder it's been established as a masterpiece.","December 15, 2013","true","49.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In Half Life you play silent protagonist number B. He differs from others because he has the power of the beard and a MIT degree that obviously had no concept of oral presentations. When it was released Half Life posed a new stage of interactive storytelling. But really it just means you’re allowed to turn away from all major plot points and stare at the wall. Still, the notion of alien invasions and government cover-ups are very popular themes as my good friend, Fox Mulder, will tell you. Instead I saw Half Life as the story of the nerds overpowering the jocks and saving the world that we desperately needed.\nHalf Life went down in history as an amazing game and the introduction of raging, hormone filled teenagers to the gaming scene via the mod Counter Strike. A spine chiller looked at in comparison to Hitler nowadays. I found myself playing through Half Life many times in the small fraction of my life I have experienced (This joke would have been better if I could say half my life) and I still have one question. Why is Gordon Freeman a hero when, during my play throughs, the scientists he is supposed to be saving served him better as meat shields? A question as mysterious to me as the G-man. Last time I was called the G-man followed the statement “you hit the spot,” during several of my ‘biology’ practices. And no, those didn’t occur at MIT.","August 6, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, there are a few bugs that are a pain in the ♥♥♥♥. I even managed to find one that affects the gameplay drastically, preventing the player from progressing. Hopefully, latter games in the series are free from this kind of issues.\nDespite that and a few other minor nuisances, I consider the technical aspect of the game to be generally good.\nThe plot of Half-Life is the game's strong point. As you play, it gets more tense.\nI don't particularly like the multiplayer mode, but that's not really a disadvantage, since the game seems to be more focused on the single-player campaign, which is awesome.\nIn short, Half-Life is old, but it's worth playing.

(personally i like it this way so it doesn't effect the pace of the gameplay)\n-the music was really cool but they could have put it in more parts of the game\n\nOverall, Valve pretty much nailed it, for it's time: 9.5/10.\n\nBut is it still an enjoyable game today?\nYes, this game has aged pretty well in most of it's categories, it's a little harder to enjoy though for most gamers.\n\nFor todays standards: 8.25/10\n\nmy personal rating for todays standards: 9.3/10\n\ngo check this one out, you will probably like it, but i would wait for a steam sale though ;)\n\n\n","January 1, 2014","true","135.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What a game we have here. Playing this in the year of 2013 (After having played the wonderful Half-Life 2 some time ago), it's still a joyful experience. The awesome narrative, level design, gunplay and even artificial intelligence still work very well, making it easy to see just how incredibly ahead of its time the game was. Some things that stood out for me in particular were the level design, which changed drastically throughout the game and helped to keep things fresh, the intense (still to this day!) combat, and especially the enemies. Not only were there many different types of enemies, each one interesting and with their very own methods of attack, but for 1998 they were an extremely intelligent bunch of baddies- especially the Special Forces soldiers, who are constantly flanking and lobbing grenades. Not only that, but I found the mini-puzzles to be quite entertaining. All in all, this is one heck of a game, and there's no wonder it's been established as a masterpiece.","December 15, 2013","true","49.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For being such an old game it is very good! It took a very long time to get through the whole game and the story was quite extensive and very interesting! I played this game simply because I  love the Portal series so very much! Since Portal and Half-Life are linked together I figured I would get more of an explanation as to how the two game link and while portal was never hinted to, for obvious reasons (it didn't come out for another 7 or so years, duh!), I could see how the stories linked on the simple basis of the apocolypse. I'm excited to find out the rest of the story in Half life 2!\nThe controls are useful and it is very nice that you can save at any point rather than just key points, this is an extremely helpful feature, especially for the ever frustrating jump climb! :P The gameplay is fun and flows pretty smoothly. I have no big problems with the run/jump style. The Story was phenomenol and I really enjoyed it! They put a lot of work and effort into building a great story line.\nThe Dialogue is pretty good. You never hear Gordon speak, only scientists, guards, etc. which at times is quite comical. The Level Design is also phenominal. They did a lot of work on putting out as many unique levels as possible and they did a great job. The AI is not too much of a problem and I think it was quite advanced for its time. The enemy wont shoot at you if they cant see you which is actually quite nice. They sometimes get into a more strategic formation to face me which is also good work.\nThe World Design, along with the level design, is phenomenol. The story is linear, but with good cause. It is a story, not an RPG choice adventure. VALVe tells the story via game and I really like it! The Graphics are absolutely lesser than now, but I love it! The nostalgia is great! I really appreciate the old game made available for current PCs because a lot of the modern games can only be supported by super computers and its really nice to be able to play a quality game on a netbook, crappy PC, etc. Finally, the sound goes along with the nostalgia and I love the 8-bit sound effects and voices and music. The music is few and far between, but that just makes it all the more appreciated.\nThis is definitely one of the video games you need to play. Please support this amazing company, they created Steam and many wonderful games, like Portal and Half Life. Buy this game!\n\nThe Review outline style was taken from Game Developers Tycoon. Please also consider that game for it is great! :D\n","January 18, 2014","true","25.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The player you play as is Dr. Gordon "Freeman", A scientist who works at a research facility called Black Mesa. He is a part of a experiment there that went horribly wrong, a resonance cascade occurs, causing portals between Earth and a alien world called Xen to intersect, causing aliens from Xen to attack Black Mesa! Dr. Freeman now must find a way out of Black Mesa by fighting his way through hordes of aliens. The action in the game is great, there are 14 weapons in the game, you start small then you work you're way up to a rocket launcher! First: you start off with a crowbar, then you get a simple pistol, then a shotgun, and then a SMG,etc. The storytelling is great, I wont try to give any spoilers, but the military will "intervene". Also, at some points you will have to think to survive, for example: you find a mounted gun later on in the game, and there will be a horde of aliens that you must kill to pass on you will have to think which alien is about to shoot at you or which alien is closest to you, Even though Half-Life is a old game it's still a game that lives up to it's title to this very day, so I recommend everybody to play this game :D, good luck at Black Mesa, you will need it. *salutes*","August 9, 2014","true","68.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In the Black Mesa scientific research and developemt facility (Interesting Banter: Black Mesa roughly translates to Black Table, with Mesa meaning Table in spanish. #TheMoreYouKnow) Gordon Freeman, age 27, inadvertently causes the apocalypse, when a rare crystal found from the facility's experiments with teleportation is places under a super-powered analyzer, which then overloads and opens a wormhole to an alien dimension full of creatures that leech onto your head and gain control over your body, creating zombies.\nLost intrest yet? No? Good.\nArmed with a crowbar, a mech suit, and a series of shooty-shooty bang bang tubes, you face the onslaught, prepared to get to the surface and call for help. Does this go well? Buy the game and see.*\n\nThis game is old. Like, 1998 old. But when it came out, it revolutionalised the gaming industry with it's unique storytelling and gameplay style. It is a first person shooter that will be remembered for years to come, despite it being 16 next month.\n\nHowever, this game can be PUNISHINGLY dificult, especiallly in later levels. No doubt will you find yourself wishing you'd picked an easier difficulty at some point in the game.\nHaving said this, though, Half Life is still damn enjoyable, even to this day.\n\nVerdict: This is a damn fine shooter.\n8/10.

I found it reasonably difficult, I had to get several walkthroughs, and the combat was a bit hard and slightly boring. The enemies are very slow and their attacks are very easy to dodge, however, the combat gets much more difficult when you start fighting human enemies, who have guns. I enjoyed the first-person precision platforming, like when you're standig on the thin crate, terrified and trying your hardest not to fall off, which is fairly difficult, because you move at quite a speed and simply tapping the w key makes you go about hgalf a meter, when the crate is only a quater oif a meter. You start Half-life on a train which takes you through a whole Black Mesa factory( A company that is evil but you turn against them) The train bit is quite long, so get settled in and listen to the speaker. You can move around the train, so you can see more interesting things, like the train tracks from behind, which is VERY interesting. I bought Half-life complete so I got DLC, which I haven't played yet, so I have more content. But I really hpoe Vlve doesn't kick me off steam for not giving yheir game a perfect reveiw, because it is the best source of games I have ever used.

Instead, Half Life throws you right into the life of an average scientist, Gordon Freeman, who finds himself in the middle of an extraordinary adventure. Every moment in the game is experienced through the eyes of Gordon Freeman, and real-time scripted events allow the gamers to react to changes around.

The level design is great, and it feels spacious without being too open (I never got lost, which is pretty amazing given my track record). There are some great scripted events which lend to the cinematic feel, and while the game doesn't usually have music, when it does kick in it's always super hype. There are also some neat and well-designed bosses which require more that brute force to take down.

It's fast paced action which will completely destroy you later on in single player if you jump into everything blindly, and that fast pace makes the multiplayer incredibly fun. It gets pretty chaotic with a lot of players. I suppose my only complaint about the multiplayer is how easy it is to get spawnkilled. Other than that, I can't think of too much wrong with the game for it's time, and I'd recommend buying it if you don't have it yet.\n\nEDIT:\nA small problem I have is when it autosaves. It sometimes does so at the worst imaginable times, like rounding a corner with a bunch of enemies while you have 1 health left. Of course one could always load the previous autosave, but it's still fairly annoying.","January 6, 2014","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

What a game we have here. Playing this in the year of 2013 (After having played the wonderful Half-Life 2 some time ago), it's still a joyful experience. The awesome narrative, level design, gunplay and even artificial intelligence still work very well, making it easy to see just how incredibly ahead of its time the game was. Some things that stood out for me in particular were the level design, which changed drastically throughout the game and helped to keep things fresh, the intense (still to this day!) combat, and especially the enemies. Not only were there many different types of enemies, each one interesting and with their very own methods of attack, but for 1998 they were an extremely intelligent bunch of baddies- especially the Special Forces soldiers, who are constantly flanking and lobbing grenades. Not only that, but I found the mini-puzzles to be quite entertaining.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gsuszealot/recommended/70/","gsuszealot","a gas can","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gsuszealot/","175 products in account","Just finished Half-Life and I must say it was quite an adventure. For being such an old game it is very good! It took a very long time to get through the whole game and the story was quite extensive and very interesting! I played this game simply because I  love the Portal series so very much! Since Portal and Half-Life are linked together I figured I would get more of an explanation as to how the two game link and while portal was never hinted to, for obvious reasons (it didn't come out for another 7 or so years, duh!), I could see how the stories linked on the simple basis of the apocolypse. I'm excited to find out the rest of the story in Half life 2!\nThe controls are useful and it is very nice that you can save at any point rather than just key points, this is an extremely helpful feature, especially for the ever frustrating jump climb! :P The gameplay is fun and flows pretty smoothly. I have no big problems with the run/jump style. The Story was phenomenol and I really enjoyed it! They put a lot of work and effort into building a great story line.\nThe Dialogue is pretty good. You never hear Gordon speak, only scientists, guards, etc. which at times is quite comical. The Level Design is also phenominal. They did a lot of work on putting out as many unique levels as possible and they did a great job. The AI is not too much of a problem and I think it was quite advanced for its time. The enemy wont shoot at you if they cant see you which is actually quite nice. They sometimes get into a more strategic formation to face me which is also good work.\nThe World Design, along with the level design, is phenomenol. The story is linear, but with good cause. It is a story, not an RPG choice adventure. VALVe tells the story via game and I really like it! The Graphics are absolutely lesser than now, but I love it! The nostalgia is great! I really appreciate the old game made available for current PCs because a lot of the modern games can only be supported by super computers and its really nice to be able to play a quality game on a netbook, crappy PC, etc. Finally, the sound goes along with the nostalgia and I love the 8-bit sound effects and voices and music. The music is few and far between, but that just makes it all the more appreciated.\nThis is definitely one of the video games you need to play. Please support this amazing company, they created Steam and many wonderful games, like Portal and Half Life. Buy this game!\n\nThe Review outline style was taken from Game Developers Tycoon.

Yes, I am, but that's because it's so amazingly fantastic, so mind-blowingly good, so unquestionably a masterpiece, that it deserves to have what has already been said about it millions of times said again by me. If there was any doubt in my mind that video games are art, it has been eradicated by this game and it's sequel. This may seem like an odd choice for claiming games are art, but I believe it has the depth, complexity, and emotional attachment that a true work of art has. People latch on to games like Braid as examples of games as art because they outwardly appear to be "artsy" games, with vague plots and symbolism and plenty of emotional torment thrown at you, but once you look deeper a certain amount of pretentiousness is revealed, and you have to question how meaningful such works really are. Half-Life is not pretentious. It is not trying to appear "artsy," because it knows it has enough value to not have to hide behind such a facade to convince the public of it's worth. It may seem silly to reccomend such a famous game because "everyone's played it," but no matter how famous a game is there will always be someone who hasn't played it (I know I have a whole bucket list of essential titles that remain unplayed, such as Final Fantasy VI and Resident Evil 4), and if that person is you, rectify the situation as soon as possible. It remains a staple of any gamer's collection for a reason. Just be careful dismounting ladders. Fall damage is a ♥♥♥♥♥ in this game.\n\nScore: 10/10","November 1, 2013","true","42.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Half-Life is an action game, with a very interesting story and an amazing atmosphere. Many complain it is another boring game because of bad graphics and release date. Even though it was made in 1998, it will always hold the first place on the top of my gaming list.

The gameplay is absolutely incredible, the story is interesting, and the controls are tighter then the skinny jeans I tried to wear in 7th grade. Exciting and thrilling despite the graphical limitations. It's almost difficult to believe this was made in 1998, well if the character models didn't look like they had been modeled out of clay and then dropped multiple times. I especially love the health and suit mechanics. It may be old, but it gives you a truly epic feel. Boss fights though scarce are some of my favorites. Thrilling, epic, awesome are all words that could be used to describe this game. I thought I had seen the real experience with the Black Mesa Half-Life 2 Mod, but I was mistaken. There are some differences, and the mod doesn't have the same atmosphere as the original. The original game is easier anyway and I respect that this game is one of the best out there and highly recommend that you play it if you get a chance. It works on even low-rate computers like mine and is way underpriced if you ask me. The music is great, and the level design is some of the best that I have ever seen. Among my few minor complaints are that the friendly NPCs are terrible at following, limited voice actor variety, crouch jumping is annoying, and what you need to do is sometimes nearly impossible to figure out without lots of trial and error.

I mean i liked HL2 more than the orginal in terms of story and in gameplay but HL1 is very fun and at the time it was original. Other games tried to copy the DOOM formula which had a muscular guy who finds joy in shooting ♥♥♥♥ and saves th day with a kick-♥♥♥ soundtrack in the backround. But HL made something original. You now have a scientist who is not used to being a "hero" who saves has to get out of Black Mesa or else he'll die. The only soundtrack you have is whe something important happens like an explosuion and some music will play or when you get into a heated action scene. And one of my fav parts or the game is you can take your time playing the game. Most shooters at the time just ♥♥♥♥ing bombarded you with enemies and constanly made you fight but his game let you take your time and the most enemies you will meet at a time is like 5-6 where as others will send like 15-20 enemies just all trying to ♥♥♥ rape you. But other than that, the story is amazing but they really changes the story in HL2 which on a way annoyed me. But the story so far is amazing, the enemies are not easy but not to hard, the puzzles really make you think about what you need to do. All round the game is amazing. but i still like HL2 a bit more than the original. The only thing i wish they would do is re-release the game when ever source 3  is brought out for full release. Sorry biut HL Source dosen't count that much. All in all Half Life gets a 9.2/10","March 4, 2015","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
