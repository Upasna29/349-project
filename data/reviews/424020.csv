If you are a creative person or someone who enjoys modeling actual places, you will enjoy using this.   At first it is a bit daunting to learn, but this new version makes it much easier than previous versions, such as creating traffic intersections.    It includes many european models, but if you want more you can purchase additional items @ the eep shop or obtain freeware online.  There are a few american models as well.  Have fun!","February 5","true","234.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can also buy routes and other items from the devs online shop.  Several sample routes are included and they're beautifully created. Even other vehicules like cars, trucks, buses, airplanes, helicopters,  boats, tractors, people, animals, weather, water, day/night cycle, etc are all amazingly detailed. Animated people(in EEP12 version only), grass and trees look great and move as train passes next to them...very awesome detail.  EEP12 EXPERT on Steam is also in English...love it!  I Bought Expert Edition.

However, this is not really a game but more a simulation program of a model train track with working models. The building possibility's are extensive but needs a steep learning curve to know how to use all of those. Some landscaping tools can use improvement and no updates for the steam version are frequent.\nBuying expensive additional downloads (priced in EURO) trough the Eep website is a problem on Steam because the website is asking for the game serial number, not available at Steam, before purchase, so no way (as I know off) to buy them yet.\nStill one of the best Train/building "games" on the market (EEP12 Expert) and highly recommended for train freaks like me.","May 21","true","234.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Since then I’ve actively used Trainz and TS2016, both excellent software.\n\nI recently purchased Railroad X and more recently EEP 12. I don’t claim to be an expert in either, as I’m still on a steep learning curve. Yes, the learning curve is steep, but the software is also the most powerful software of its kind that I’ve used.\n\nAt this stage in my experience I give it two thumbs up and will update this review further in a few weeks.\n","May 22","true","58.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
