Just the joy that you have slicing and slashing through hordes of mythological creatures, including Satyrs, Harpies, Cyclops, Typhon, the most powerful titan, and even the king of the underworld himself; Hades. You will not only enjoy fighting your most darkest adversaries, but also finding the most epic of loot. This game features thousands of different items you can find across the land. Speaking of land, this game takes place over Ancient Greece, Egypt, and Asia. At each stop, different opponents will greet you (by that I mean try and rip you to shreds). Not only is this game fun, but it is also a type of learning game. Like me, I found out about a lot of Ancient Greek mythology by playing this game. Most areas in this game are real places in this geographical area of the world. For example, in the first act (Greece) some of the towns include Delphi, Athens, Sparta, etc. The boss fights are also exhilarating. After almost every main boss there is a chest (or in some cases an orb) which can be opened, and in them are magical items that when dropping are completely randomized. Because of this randomization, every time you play, you should expect a new experience to emerge. Each time you play, you find new items, become a new hero, and save the world. The multiplayer works out fine, but when playing with friends, I recommend sharing your classes so that you can come up with the best class setup between you. What are the classes you ask? The classes include Storm, Earth, Warfare, Spirit, Defense, Hunting, Nature, and Rogue. Once you reach level two, you can pick your first class. Then, at level eight, you can pick your second class. After that, you will no longer be able to choose a different class on the same character. It's a fun game and truly does bring out the adventerous side of you. Mortals, save all of humanity in... Titan Quest!\n\nEDIT: Multiplayer is no longer a key feature of the game. It will be required of you to install outside programs to play with your friends. Sorry if this may've been an inconveniance for you.","December 2, 2013","true","23.8"," 217 of 237 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","217","237","0","14"

TQ took the concept of Diablo 2 and expanded on it, succeeding far better than Diablo 3 did. The graphics were great, enemies difficult yet not impossible to defeat, classes were highly customizable and fun, tons of gear and items, and mods just added to the game. An inventory mod allowed you to duplicate items and gather a large collection of sets.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this game is the lack of level randomization. However, knowing exactly where you are going can be a plus. The expansion was a fantastic add-on and a must have for this game.

I played it a couple of years back and I played it a lot. I bought it here on Steam to have a digital copy of it. It is often mentioned as a Diablo 2 clone and while the mechanics are similar (action RPG style) the story, atmosphere and visuals are different. Also the available class and skill distribution is different. You start off as a random soldier but you get to pick from Masteries which then give you skills to fight off the hordes of enemies. My favourite skill was the Colossus Form. There are a couple of shortcomings in this title but many are addressed in the Immortal Throne expansion (I also wrote a review for it) and as such I recommend getting the Gold edition. Overall the game has that epic feel of fighting legendary ancient enemies and the atmosphere/visuals resemble that. Also worth mentioning is the classic loot tiers depicted by different colored names and the 3 difficulty levels.

It is an add-on, but improves on the original game plus adds some levels.  I didn't realize this and played the original game first.\n\nThis is an Action RPG, which is apparently the genre created by Diablo, where you hack & slash a bunch of enemies,  level up, and collect tons of loot.  The Greek setting makes the game and enemies interesting, although you still get some enemies like undead and ghosts.  The story quests and voice-over are decent and make for a nice progression, though these games are more about killing and loot.\n\nMy main gripe is that the final bosses are much harder than the other enemies.  You may get to the end and find that you simpy cannot beat the final boss with cheating or grinding levels.  I managed to beat the final boss of the original game (after many tries), but I cheated to beat the Immortal Throne boss.","January 5, 2012","true","49.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The game is replayable, in a way similar to Dark Souls' NG+. So i decided to play through it but a bug occurred: items with spell recharge time's reduction didn't work. It may sounds silly, but for my mage character this was important, thus this bug annoyed me and i didn't play the game anymore.

If you happen to have Titan Quest Gold or at the very least Titan Quest Immortal Throne play that instead.  Immmortal Throne is the expansion to Titan Quest and adds graphical updates, another equipable gear slot, more quests and another ACT making it 4 ACTs in total.\n\nIf you like games like Diablo, Torchlight and Grim Dawn this is a must play through.\n\nEasily granting 30+ hours of gameplay and over 40+ with the expansion.

There are so many similarities in both features and execution that you might catch yourself wondering if this is how Diablo 3 would have looked if Blizzard didn't insist on only releasing sequels 5+ years after the last sale is made. There are several problems however that keep it out of the same league as Diablo though.\n\nTitan Quest is a classic click until your fingers fall off action RPG in the by now classic style of Diablo. The formula feels so familiar by now that playing any incarnation of the genre without any new additions makes you almost forget which game you're actually playing.\n\nThe ancient Greek backdrop is quite pretty even if the mythology has been somewhat perverted for the sake of making it into a gaming experience, the tried and true lore of said civilization makes for some above average questing and dialog however. Although that is of course never really that much of a deciding factor in a game like this.\n\nThe character building system of just starting you out as a guy in a tunic and only opening up for more intricate customizing as you gain more levels further down the line works quite well but it doesn't really add anything new to the genre. You will still end up with the supercharged min-max character that absolutely destroys everything in a way your first character could only dream of.\n\nThe game is quite pretty and the enemies are fairly varied even if they are just ancient Greek variations of things we already know.\n\nThe problem with Titan Quest isn't as much that it does something wrong, it's that it everything it does right has already been done right by so many games before it. There is very little new to the formula and it makes the game feel as just another stopgap meant to satisfy the market while Blizzard remembers how to make sequels.","December 7, 2012","true","214.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

I reordered on Steam since I can no longer get updates for my hardcopies (what the heck...$5 for both).

Game now starts without trouble even using my start icon.  Options menu allowed adjustments for my widescreen and the game looks great. I think it looks better than Diablo. Lots of loot.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudzfryd/recommended/4540/","dudzfryd","dudz_fryd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dudzfryd/","81 products in account","Some say this is the best of the Diablo 2 clones with better graphics.  The base game is eight years old now and having played newer titles like Torchlight 2, Dungeon Siege 2 and 3  as well as others, I think that's selling it a bit short.  It's held up well although you won't find features now taken for granted like player customization, Steam achievements, automapping and multiplayer party features.  The game is engaging and challenging but just enough to keep pulling you along.  There are no 20 minute play sessions, more like a few hours or more.\n\nThe game looks great, the maps are interesting but sometimes it does seem a bit long between merchants and you can run out of health potions quickly.  When that happens it can be a bit of a grind but at least you get XP for your trouble.  The camera angles are failry limited but you can zoom in and out.  There are times I wish I had more control of the camera but it doesn't really get in the way of playing the game.  Unlike Dungeon Siege 3 whose camera controls were so bad they made the game unplayable with their wild random swings.   Titan Quests stays locked on in comparison.\n\nIf I had one complaint in the single player it would be the combat system.  You're forced to fight one enemy at a time even if you're going up against 30 baddies.  You spend a lot of time selecting individual opponents and chugging health potions to get through it.  At least I haven't been trapped by a such a group.  There always seems to be an avenue to run away when needed and the baddies  only chase you for a short time.\n\nThe ability to save on the fly is great but expect to have to hack through everything you already dispatched again when you come back.  I kind of like things I kill to stay dead in the same game.  Altough to it's credit if you don't leave the game session,  dead things will stay dead.  I just wish the saves would follow suit.  It's another example of how the game can be a bit of a grind in some places.\n\nYou can customize weapons and armor with enchantments and the inventory system is very much like torchlight or any other RPG with inventory slots set up in a grid.  The skills tree is easy enough to understand but the game is a bit stingy with skill points meaning your special abilities won't do you much good till you're done with the game.  It can be annoying to get beaten by a lower level enemy who has a special ability that you're nowhere near achieving.\n\nThere is fast travel capability that you can use on the fly which is something I liked in Torchlight 2  and Dungeon Siege 2 where you can leave and then transport back to exactly where you were. That's a time saver and potentially a life saver when you run out of health potions or fill up you rinventory with loot.\n\nIf this game really falls down anywhere, however,  it's the multiplayer/co-op gameplay.  Yes it has LAN play which is welcome but unlike newer games in this genre XP and loot aren't shared. between players  Which means if you're level 3 and you go into a game with a level 16 player all they can really do for you is play bodyguard which means there's not much in it for them.  The loot drops don't level with the player either so often times you'll pick up items you won't be able to use or are useless scarp metal.  Although that's a common complaint in RPG's and not just Titan Quest.\n\nIn the end even with its flaws I really liked this game and the benefits far outweigh the annoyances and goes in the list of my top 3 favorite RPG's so far.","June 9, 2014","true","56.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The world really  does look beautiful even with its pseudo 3D isometric look (with a touch of camera zoom  that allows you get  get  close upand almost personal).\n\nJogging into a camp full  of beasts and butchering them with an axe feels amazingly  satisfying. Playing in Co-op or SP both allow you  to   take on   hordes of monsters, or  valiantly struggle against a dozen Ray Harryhausen skeletons or a grumpy gorgon, especially once you've gained  some    XP.\n\nYou can  transfer all of your  booty over from SP to MP play, and as with all RPG's,  upgrading your character to  carry more goodies is a must do.  You'll soon find yourself kitted out in  the   snaziest of  armour and the  best  of  weapons a warrior could  want.","August 3, 2012","true","43.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

It was such a huge step forward facing Diablo 2 (my opinion of course)!\nSo many tiny details which are adorable ("living nature" for example).\nThe character growing is really your choice and experiments are advisable in order to find your best balance between pure direct attacks and magic tricks.\nOnly problems, if you want to call them so, are the small inventory (there are going to be hard choices!) and gameplay a little annoying after hours of hacking and smashing. Anyway it worth absolutely the money. Get it if you like such genre, no doubt about it.\nDo not forget to get also Immortal Throne.....gold pack is best choice.\n\nDecisamente consigliato. Mi ricordo quando lanciandolo per la prima volta Diablo 2 sparì all'istante. Si trattava di un grosso passo in avanti in termini di grafica, suono, struttura dei dungeon e crescita del personaggio.....maestrie da scegliere con molta cura all'interno delle quali la stessa singola assegnazione dei punti alla singola abilità è una decisione da prendere con molta attenzione.  Come accennato in inglese unici difetti, se così li vogliamo chiamare, sono l'inventario un pò piccolo (quale oggetto vendere per fare spazio? Aaarrgh che strazio!) e una certa ripetitività di fondo che comunque rientra pienamente nella normalità del genere. Acquistatelo a occhi chiusi, possibilmente con l'espansione Immortal Throne.

Who knew such a gem of a game existed? I was surprised how it's fun again to play on older MMORPG type of games and get hooked on it for hours. You can select a class as you hit level 2 and select what will be your primary class and then trick out the skill slots and character stats per level in a big way. What I like more is the Primary and Secondary weapons. It may not be much but you can switch from a melee to a range type of attack in just a snap. In-game spells/attacks may leave somethign to be desired but it still details the action of what is needed; this is nearly a 8 year old game so its showing its age. But that doesn't mean it's getting boring. Lore of the game is good, although a bit too slow paced. The action of the game kind of compensates for that but the story-telling is kinda slow.

Titan Quest gives pretty decent variety of monsters and beautiful in my opinion locations. You can develop your hero by choosing 2 out of 9 different masteries which have own unique skills. The game itself is very linear, you won't miss any side quest if you just reveal the whole map, there's no need to go back to the previous location, you'll never get lost. Even though the gameplay is simple I felt motivated to visit every cave and tomb, collect gold & equipment and kill every single monster on the map.\nAbout difficulty: I played on normal mode and it was pretty hard to start (My character supposed to be mighty hero but he had to run away from a couple of boars. Really.), after choosing masteries it was easier but still challenging. At the end of the game difficulty level increased (Final boss defeated after approx. 60 health potions and few deaths).\nThe plot is simple (Go there, kill that guy, go somewhere else find that thing and kill the other guy...) but enjoyable. Graphics are really good, the game itself was very fun. The only thing that annoyed me was voice acting, very unnatural but you get used to it. Titan Quest is definitely worth playing.","May 8, 2015","true","36.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Grim Dawn is even better, check it out if you liked this!\n\n"A “Diablo clone” that’s better than Diablo and perhaps the best of its kind."\n\nImmortal Throne is an expansion which adds a whole new act to the already 3 act campaign of Titan Quest. I also played using the fan patch version 1.17. This review is of Titan Quest as a whole including the expansion.\n\nTQ is a hack and slash RPG much like Diablo. You run around clicking monsters to kill them, gaining experience and leveling up. The main focus of these types of games is the finding of loot dropped by monsters and chests. I will now go in depth about the various features of this game.\n\nGENERAL GAMEPLAY INFORMATION\nI wanted to make a section to tell you about general gameplay features and facts to aid you as you read this review. The max level in TQ is 65 and IT increases it to 75. When you level you gain 3 skill points and 2 attribute points to spend how you like. The attribute points can be used to increase your max health or energy, or increase your strength, dexterity, or intelligence. There are 3 difficulty levels with the next highest one being unlocked after beating the game on the previous difficulty.\n\nSTORY: 8/10\nThe story is never a big deal in these kinds of games. They're merely there to give you a reason to progress forward and kill more monsters. What is nice and something you don't often see in these kinds of games is that there are more characters you can speak to than just the quest givers. These extra characters will tell you a little bit about something, either the main quest or the situation that NPC faces. What's more is each character will say 4-5 different things if you repeatedly talk to them, and not always just a short sentence either, but real plot advancement. There's a lot of story here for both the main quest and side quests if you care to talk to the people. Of course you can completely ignore them, skipping the dialogue to progress the quest.\n\nGRAPHICS: 10/10\nI'm not an expert on graphics by far, but the graphics here look pretty good for their time. It gives my 6 year old laptop trouble, that's for sure. The physics engine for killing enemies is simply tons of fun and I will go more in depth into this later.\n\nSOUND: 10/10\nThe sound effects are pretty good. Everything sounds like it's supposed to and the enemies all sound believable. Occasionally the death sounds of certain enemies can get annoying, but that's it. There is also full voice over for all the dialogue in the game. I'm not an expert on voice acting either, but I can say with a fair amount of confidence that the voice acting in this is actually very good. The people you talk to, especially of the main quest, all do their role very well. You can tell the voice actors put real effort into it, and in the case of vendors and others, had a lot of fun. To me this is what counts and I never have trouble listening to the dialogue.\n\nSKILLS: 10/10\nThe skills are where this game really shines. How it works is that at the beginning of the game you select your gender and start the game. Upon your first level you can select your first skill mastery. There are 8 skill masteries in TQ, with a 9th one added in the expansion IT. When you reach level 8 you can select your 2nd and final skill mastery. Each mastery has many different skills you can learn such as passive skills, ones you must activate, and ones that stay active for a certain reserved energy cost. Each skill can be upgraded with points many times, the average being 12, making the skill better and better. When you level up you get 3 skill points to play with which I really enjoy. I much prefer having more skill points and longer skill advancement than fewer points and shorter, but more meaningful, skill advancement. The skills are broken up into tiers and to get access to the skills at the next tier you must invest skill points into a bar on the left. Investing in this bar will raise your health, energy, and attributes; I believe a unique feature to this game. As you can imagine this enables for massive replayability to try out all the different skill mastery combinations.\n\nThe only downside is that at least a few skills in each mastery are just plain useless or have limited usefulness. On the plus side don't worry if you put points into a skill that later you decide sucks, because by going to a certain vendor you can pay to have skill points returned to you, with the price getting incrementally larger with each point you have returned. You can also find items which will raise your skills, even allowing them to go beyond their max for even greater benefits.\n\nLOOT: 10/10\nLoot is the main focus of these kinds of games and this game does not disappoint. There are several different tiers of loot with the higher tiers of course being harder to find. There are also vendors who occasionally sell good items, but the best loot is always found. Higher difficulties will reward even better loot and more set items and uniques. There are also relics and charms dropped by monsters which you can add to your equipment to make them stronger. Higher difficulties have better relics and charms.\n\nMONSTERS: 10/10\nThere are 4 acts in the game with the expansion and each act has many unique monsters for you to fight. Although the monsters aren't palette swapped, their behavior and attack patterns generally don't change much. This isn't a big surprise though. The different monsters do have their own unique drops that you won't find from other monsters. The bosses are generally fun and usually challenging. The bosses also have their own unique drops to farm for. Monsters and bosses (as well as chests) do respawn but only when you quit the game and come back.\n\nCOMBAT MECHANICS: 10/10\nFirst I want to say something about the physics engine for killing enemies: it's awesome! Whenever you kill enemies their bodies react fairly realistically to how they were killed. Kill an enemy with a magic explosion? The body goes flying into the air! Kill a monster with a single powerful blow from your axe? The body shoots backwards! Such a thing is very nice for not only getting you immersed but helping to prevent the game from being repetitive.\n\nSomething to note is that the game plays slower than others of its kind. I know most people want their game to play at 60fps and be real fast, and that's fine. Personally I found it a tad annoying in games like Diablo 2 and Torchlight where you and the enemies move so fast. In this it's slightly slower paced to make it easier to fight enemies and not constantly miss clicking them and running around crazily.\n\nAnother thing I like is that enemies almost never run away and archers don't really move away from melee characters until later in the game. What annoys me in other games are the enemies constantly running away and then I have to run them down. In this the melee monsters swarm around you, and the archers and mages mercilessly rain arrows and magic on you. It just feels *right*.\n\nFinally I really like the fact that all magic items are identified. Instead of the tedious chore of carrying around identify scrolls, you always know what the items are and do. You also can create a teleport and tele to any unlocked place at any time, exactly like a town scroll in Diablo. Again this removes the tediousness of carrying around these scrolls and I find this very convenient letting you think about the game itself instead of the annoying scrolls.\n\nRest of review continued on GameFAQs via the link at the top because it's too long to all fit here.","October 26, 2015","true","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has everything from random and unique item drops to randomly generated levels. It is nearly identical to the classic Bliizard game. The key difference however is the class system.\n\nUnlike Diablo II where you pick your class from at the beginning, Titan Quest has your character start with base stats and abilities. As you progress your character to lv10, you are given the option to pick a job class of your choosing. Additionally, you choose a secondary job class later in the game that works in conjucton with the spells and abilities of your primary class.\n\nTo sum it up, if you ever felt Diablo III didn’t fully capture the magic of its predecessor and Trine left you wanting more, then you will absolutely love this game.\n\nAlso get the expansion.

Left it rotting in my library. Until i finally tried it.\n\nIt's quite nice really. A pretty good ARPG, foundation about a popular and rich mythology but unfamiliar to quite a few, though that leaves not much room for further creative content.\n\nOne thing i really like is the comparative (to many other RPGs, even the original HackSlash, Diablo), is the realistic loot, beastial creatures do not drop armours and swords (slay an ogre, and it drops a human-sized Mail?!), all monsters drop dented, lousy weapons they were using. It doesn't do much to make my gameplay any more OP and easier, but i appreciate that the developers made great effort in detailing this.\n\nOne more awesome feature, is its normal terrain to subterranean (caves, ruins, etc) transition. Instead of a loading screen like our diabolic counterpart, it's a smooth entry right into it, likewise, splendid detailing from the developers. Out of so many hackslashers, this is one of the first, albeit slight old game, that i experienced this feature.\n\nUser-friendly and easy to understand mapping system, with legends and icons to ease navigation. The only downside, which I do have to 'complain' about, is Greek mythology, it's not as dark and mysterious as the Diablo lore. Since i'm a very story-based person, i like researching on secret factions, artefacts origin etc.\n\nLovely game (Y)","October 22, 2015","true","23.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I finally gave it a shot and couldn't be happier with my experience so far.  I have played a lot of top-down, Diablo-esque type games - but this one is top 3 if not the best one I have played.  The UI is very easy to understand, the tutorial is helpful without being overbearing, and there are so many of the little things done right that puts this game at a very high level of playability and enjoyability.\n\nItem comparisions in game without having to compare or drop equipment, color-coding items, being able to zoom in and out in real time, a very easy and intuitive mouse and keyboard control, and the list goes on and on.  I am going to be spending a lot more time in this game and its DLC.  Progressing through the game is tough but there hasn't been a challenge yet a few extra health potions hasn't cured.  The increase in difficulty is fun without being basic.  If you're a fan of the top-down games like Diablo etc, if you enjoy the Greek mythology, or if you're looking to try a game which is just very comfortable to play, then this is something you really should try.\n\nA note about the servers - yes, they are down so you can't do multi-player from the game.  However, this game is one that is covered by Game Ranger - so within 10 minutes my friend and I downloaded that free program and had a LAN connection and were in game, having a blast.\n\nTL;DR: Yes.  This one is definitely worth it!","January 30","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Titan Quest is a polished and lengthy game with plenty of ancient monsters to slay and gargantuan amounts of loot. The environments look and feel diverse and amazingly detailed. Enemy models are intricately detailed. You have weapons and spells at your disposal and can choose 2 of several classes in order to create your character. It's not as deep and bound for infinite replayability like Diablo 2 but you can consider this as its much more approachable clone with a very nice learning curve.\n\nMy only complaint comes from the looting system: You can't compare or even view dropped items' properties when they are on the ground. Therefore you'll need to pick items up in order to see their stats which becomes a huge pain as you constantly have to manage your inventory and throw items out of your inventory in order to make space for that new item you found for comparison.\n\nAll in all, absolutely fun game with lengthy campaign and level editor. If you're into games like Diablo or Torchlight, You really can't go wrong with Titan Quest.","June 23, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you are familiar with Diablo 2, then you already know the basics of this game.  High replayability due to multiple classes which allows you to play differently as you desire.

The graphics still hold up for an older game, and the gameplay is fantastic. Throughout your travels in Greece, Egypt and Asia, you will encounter many monsters, quests, side-quests, bosses, secrets and of course, loot!\n\nAlso included in this game is an amazing class system, which allows you to play not one, but two classes at once. You could be a battlemage, investing most points into Storm and some into Warfare.\nWhen fighting monsters, you will ALWAYS get what you see. If they are holding a flaming spear, wearing armor made of bones, thats the gear that the enemy will drop, which allows for some pretty cool, unique boss drops!\n\nCoupled with the fact that there are still active multiplayer servers, and mods that add whole new areas, this game is worth more than the price it is here.\nI suggest you buy the expansion, which adds a new class, area, and story.\nIt is also most fun with friends!","September 29, 2013","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics still hold up for an older game, and the gameplay is fantastic. Throughout your travels in Greece, Egypt and Asia, you will encounter many monsters, quests, side-quests, bosses, secrets and of course, loot!\n\nAlso included in this game is an amazing class system, which allows you to play not one, but two classes at once. You could be a battlemage, investing most points into Storm and some into Warfare.\nWhen fighting monsters, you will ALWAYS get what you see. If they are holding a flaming spear, wearing armor made of bones, thats the gear that the enemy will drop, which allows for some pretty cool, unique boss drops!\n\nCoupled with the fact that there are still active multiplayer servers, and mods that add whole new areas, this game is worth more than the price it is here.\nI suggest you buy the expansion, which adds a new class, area, and story.\nIt is also most fun with friends!","September 29, 2013","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacoCat94/recommended/4540/","TacoCat94","LUIGIUS PRIME","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TacoCat94/","177 products in account","I've been playing this game since around its release back in '07. To date, I've bought 5 copies. Two of which were back in the day, before it was at such an amazingly low price. Grand total, its probably cost me about $100-$120 for all the various friends I've bought copies for.\n\nThe only reason I say all that is because I need you to understand what I mean when I say Titan Quest and Titan Quest: Immortal Throne are worth EVERY PENNY[/b].\n\nPROS\n- Graphics hold up well to current games\n\n- Sum total of 42 different class combinations to play\n\n- Different ways to play each individual class, leading to hundreds, if not thousands, of different character builds\n\n- Each play through can take upwards of 40 hours. To date, I've NEVER finished it. Not due to boredom, though. I'll get 2/3 of the way in and think of a different combination I want to try.\n\n- Loads of different artifacts of varying strength for every character type. Even when you're fully decked out, the game can still be a challenge.\n\n- IMMORTAL THRONE ONLY: Nifty, if limited, transfer area lets you take items from one character and move them to another.\n\n- Story written by Randall Wallace, writer of the movie Braveheart. Developed by Brian Sullivan, who also developed the Age of Empires series.\n\n\nCONS\n- Wonky saving system. Not that its not functional, it is. The trouble is, you can only save to certain points in the game. Similar to Dead Space, I suppose. Basically, you can "save" at any time and it'll save your quest progress. But when you reload the game, you'll spawn at the last Rebirth Fountain you visited. Depending on what you were doing when you closed the game and where you were, this can either be perfectly fine or enough to make you start a new character.\n\n- No longer supported by a company. The makers of Titan Quest, a team called Ironlore, have since lost their official funding and thus there will NEVER be another patch or update officially made. That being said, the issues I've seen that would require any fixing are at most minor and can easily be fixed in game by understanding that you just need to keep clicking past it. Most notably to me, every now and then you'll try to walk into a cave and your character will get stuck at the entrance. Maybe its a clipping issue, I have no idea. Terminology is not my strong suit. Luckily, there are unofficial fan-made patches that exist to fix many issues and improve the game for those that wish to install them.\n\n- To the best of my knowledge, multiplayer does NOT work well for characters of widely different levels. Monsters in the game are NOT leveled to you, they're all preset. When you're a level 26 and go back to the start of the game, those monsters are still level 3-5. Along these same veins, the game will not change much if one player is level 20 and the other is level 6. If you're going to play with friends, you and them both have to have characters specifically for group play.\n\n- Little to no online documentation of anything. Like, it's bloody difficult to look up a quest walkthrough. Same with information on different artifacts/armor. Apparently this game never really took off like it deserves to, and the online community seems rather limited in my opinion.\n\n\n\nOVERALL\nGiven the price Titan Quest has fallen to, I find it ridiculous to even consider buying anything but Titan Quest Gold. You get both the main game and the expansion Immortal Throne. By buying the Gold, you get both at a slight discount. When coupled with how often this game goes on sale, its more than easy enough to get both for $10 or less. I cannot recommend any game higher than I recommend Ironlore's Titan Quest.","January 1, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

While it's not the most perfect of games, it scratches the hack and slash lootfest itch very well. The voice acting is pretty bad, but the music is some of the better ambient game music I've encountered in any game series.  It's not breaking any real new ground, beyond trying to tell a more rich story than other games in the sub-genre. However, if you're the sort of person who gets excited when they see a treasure chest in games like this, you'll be in heaven. Maps re-populate when you return to your game or a region, so you can grind to get past any bosses that are too difficult, and you can mix and match various class archetypes to really customize your playstyle.\n\nThere's even an option to make custom maps and quests, though I haven't explored that, and therefore can't really make a fair assessment.\n\nIf you've never played it before, buying it on sale is a no-brainer. You will have hours of time on your hands.","May 29, 2014","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're a fan of RPG games I recommend it.","January 1, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Character customization lets you pick from 2 skill schools with many active, passive, and toggle skills that you can pick and choose from letting you create a unique hero each time. There is an attempt at a storyline here but it's a bit ridiculous and is mostly a vehicle for taking you through ancient lands with mythological monsters and locations. The music and sound are also top notch with a memorable soundtrack and immersive environmental & monster sounds.\n\nOverall, Titan Quest is a fantastic aRPG and is worth your time with or without friends.","December 17, 2012","true","30.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Saw someone praise it online somewhere so I gave it a try, and I'm glad I did. This is a very fun ARPG, much better than Diablo 3 in my opinion. The 2006 game also looks fantastic even by todays standards, very colour and super crisp on max settings. Even though I'm not that far into the game yet, the combat is rewarding, with a diverse skill tree and specializations for your character.

It's an ok game, not less and not more. I thought I was going to play it longer when I started it because it appeared like a relaxing, brighter, less gory Diablo clone. But at some point I felt bored by it. I was playing with the "Immortal Throne" expansion giving me some gameplay additions, finished the storyline of the base game and took a few steps into the expansion areas. The story is dripping around and has barely anything that struck me. It's more or less your typical "Hero finds artifact and slays evil creature" thing. There is some Greek mythology background lore and it's visible in the design of some monsters, characters and in the places you visit, but I never got hooked by it too much.\n\nAt times it felt tedious going through some areas as the level design is nothing to call home about - which is a bit surprising because the game seems to be using fixed level layouts while Diablo's levels are generated randomly, and yet some of the randomized levels from Diablo I remember better than any of those in Titan Quest.\n\nThe combat felt dull at times too. I was using a melee fighter mostly. There is little variety in the monsters you fight per area, usually lots of small ones, a few big ones, some occassional bosses posing a bigger threat. I had hard times enjoying it when I was about 3/4 through it.\n\nThe voice acting is pretty boring. The NPCs all have individual names and give you their opinions on things happening around, but none I found to be as interesting as the NPCs in Diablo (whose names and voice acting I can somewhat remember - nothing like that in Titan Quest). The quests they give you are never reinventing the wheel either: Obtain stuff, kill things and the likes.\n\nI didn't try the multiplayer. I've heard people say this game is more about the singleplayer. I don't usually play such games in multiplayer.","April 14, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Not least of all because it's like approximately SEVERAL THOUSAND other games out there on the market.  It is pretty good for what it is, though...Diablo Clone 14768G reporting for duty, sir, with some rather spiffy graphics and a fairly interesting setting, but most importantly of all, EXACTLY the same gameplay as people who dig these kinds of super-repetitive, mind-numblingly simplistic dungeon-hacks have come to expect...games in which the only "strategy" one can possibly apply is "Should I just run straight into the centre of these thirty-something foes, or maybe draw them towards me a handful at a time?" and "Should I wear the bracelet which makes me run infinitesimally faster, or the one which gives me 2% more hit points?"  Decisions, decisions.\n\nThe decision of yours truly was to chuck this game in altogether at about the point where I realised things were NOT going to get any more complicated or varied, and where it was pretty obvious that give or take a colosseum or a Chimera or two, I'd already "seen" pretty much all the game had to offer without actually needing to invest another 50+ hours of gameplay into viewing such sights with my physical eyes.  However, if you're the type of person who somehow doesn't tire of these kinds of games - and chances are you already know if you ARE that person or not - then I would heartily recommend it, 'cause it's definitely good of its sort.\n\nVerdict: 7/10.","July 18, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Unfortunately, in Titan Quest, the loot is really, really boring.  99% of drops are going to be left on the ground.  It appears that once you beat the game on normal, set items, and other decent gear drops when you play the game on the next difficulty setting.  No way I am putting any more time in to find out.\n\nMy major issue with the game was the fact that it was extremely easy right up until the final boss battle.  30+ hours in and I died twice.  I got to the last battle and couldn't do anything to the Titan boss.  I don't mind hard games, but make the difficulty linear, not all of a sudden.  I looked up strategies and the most recommended was an exploit.  No thanks.\n\nThe game does have some positives.  The skill trees are interesting, and some of the creature models and locations are fun.  Oddly though, for such an old game my video card was going nuts processing it.\n\nSo with 30+ hours in, I cannot recommend this game.

It is a decent looking isometric RPG in which you will kill and loot all things hoping to find your next great weapon or stat boosting trinket.\n\nI enjoyed 14 hours of this game as a bow and spear speciliast with a little experience put into Thunder and Ice spells. Although I liked the $3 adventure, I did not finish the game because the process of "explore this area, kill everything and move on to the next" became tiring and dull especially because the dialogue, lore, and plot are vapid and unengaging. Their isn't deep strategey, or 100s of creature types to test your intelligence, just lots of repetition that tests your endurance. The bosses were my favorite part of the game but the strategy for all of them ended up being "bring lots of health potions."\n\nIf you have the Diablo itch like I had, I recommend something like Torchlight or Path of Exile over Titan Quest.

If there were any sort of pay-off I wouldn't mind, but you're literally clicking Satyrs to death only to click more Satyr's for the next 60 hours. Skinner-box at it's finest. I would have liked seeing the chinese map, but I'm not going to waste another 20 hours clicking scorpions just for that.\n\nI wanted to like this game, but the sheer pointlessness of slaughtering mobs for better loot in order to then slaughter stronger mobs for up to 60 hours seems like such a waste of time, even for video game standards.

Sadly, it suffers from a host of issues that make it a flawed and frustrating game.  Patient (stubborn) gamers who don't mind spending time grinding levels might enjoy it.  It is well worth one's time to read up on a couple user-made FAQs and guides before starting.  Picking the right skills is key, and the game has little advice on the subject.  TQ offers a lot of gameplay for the price, but much of that will not precisely qualify as 'fun.'  It takes a fair amount to time to get to a sufficiently high level and gather powerful enough gear to advance the main quest.\n\nTorchlight is a more enjoyable and better looking game and I would heartily recommend it first.  Bastion is better still and my top choice for the hack n slash genre.  Having played those, TQ is not a bad game to pick up on sale, especially for a seasoned CRPG player with a stubborn streak.  It does run pretty well on older hardware.","August 5, 2012","true","144.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Mythology themed levels, monsters, items, and story. A great skill system that lets you combine multiple skill trees and abilities to create your unique blend of hero. You can be a shield slamming summoner with some healing spells if you want. The maps are large and mostly outdoors, and are all connected, where you can actually run from one village to the next, although still mostly linear (can't run anywhere but the next village). Lots of attention to detail in this game, with small things like monsters actually wearing the armor and weapon models for what they have equipped, and then dropping them when they die. I highly recommend this game to fans of ARPGs, its one of the best available, even today.","July 14, 2014","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you liked those games, you'll probably like this game. I say probably because this game made a few errors in their attempt to improve upon the genre.\n\nThe Good\n\nThe presentation and graphics are nice. And I mean really nice.\n\nThe areas are large and reward exploration. You will find all sorts of little monster camps and loot aches.\n\n\n\nThe Bad\nThe skill system is rather lazily implemented. You see, while it allows you to pick a primary and secondary class there's actually little difference between the classes, furthermore, there's no in game bonus for choosing a different combination. You know like how in diablo or Torchlight  you could trigger different dialog depending on the class, even different quests. Not so here. So while in theory you have dozens of class combinations and potentially as many play-styles, it is merely an illusion.\n\nThe Animatiuons, though crisp, are also repetitive. In that the difference between two special  attacks can at times be minisculwe\n\nThe save system is horrendous. I mean really horrendous. the maps are huge and open but since the save and warp points are sooo far away, you get alot of fatigue built up because once you start out, you face two choices.  Quit and wind up restarting at the last respawn point that was maybe two zones back. Or Keep going to the next warp point which may be another two zones away. This can make travesal a bit of a chore.\n\nAll in all it is still a good solid game and I can recommend with no shame, just maybe consider games like Torchlight or The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing before you pick this one up. You'll likely be happier with those.","January 10","true","37.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Whisk the eggs: Crack both eggs into a mixing bowl. Whisk the eggs until completely combined, and season with salt and pepper. If you\'re adding cheese or other fillings, make sure they are prepped and nearby.\n2. Warm the skillet and melt the butter: Place an 8-inch skillet over medium-high heat and melt the butter. Tilt the skillet as the butter melts to evenly coat the bottom. When the butter stops sizzling, the pan is heated and ready.\n3. Pour the eggs into the skillet: Pour the whisked eggs into the skillet. Immediately tilt the pan so the eggs coat the entire bottom. The eggs should sizzle on contact; if not, continue cooking, but remember to heat the pan a little longer next time.\n4. Drag and push the eggs to form waves: Use a spatula to gently drag and push the cooked eggs from the edges toward the center of the pan, making space for the uncooked eggs and forming waves in the omelette. Tilt the skillet so that the uncooked eggs flow into the open spaces.\n5. Cook the omelette for 1 to 2 minutes: The omelette will finish cooking in 1 to 2 minutes. When done, the bottom will be set and the edges will look crisp. The top of the omelette should still look fairly wet and uncooked, but there will no longer be any loose, easily flowing liquid egg — the omelette will continue cooking off the heat, so finish when you think the top still seems a bit underdone.\n6. Top with cheese and fillings: If using, sprinkle the cheese and fillings down the center of the omelette.\n7. Fold the omelette: Fold the bottom third of the omelette over the center, and then fold the top third down. Alternatively, fold the omelette in half.\n8. Slide the omelette onto a plate: Gently slide the omelette onto a plate and garnish with parsley. Eat right away while still hot.","May 31","true","4.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

Is it outside the realm of possibility that he would say up the road and take a right?\n\nLoot is dissapointing most times too.

One great thing about TQ(:IT) is the ability to pick any two classes in the same character. The best thing is the fact that the devs don't try to force you to have fun their way. This action arpg is one of the rare "lazy build" tolerant ones out there. Pet/aura builds allow for a more casual and relaxed experience. Also the game is massively huge. But this starts to be a problem as the gameplay feels contrived. The monsters definitely feel cardboard. Almost plant like. But since pet/aura builds are possible if you wish you can basicallty ignore the monsters and focus entirely on your character/pets. The worst thing about the game other than this is the accents in the voice acting combined with the player worship feels icky for some reason. The NPC's are completely static. They feel completely dead like the rest of the world really. There isn't even an attempt to make the towns feel alive.

Alt-tabbing between my browser and back to the black screen made a frozen picture with blinking bars from the intro video appear, with the audio playing.\n\nSo, here we have yet another publisher making money on Steam games not working. Time to check out GOG, I guess, as neither Steam nor the publishers, for too many games now, care about non-working games - just the money.\n\nI suggest publisher NORDIC GAMES get off their, for this title at least, scamming butts and make the game work like intended before trying to make more money from people on this.\n\nHopefully Immortal Throne works.

In this case, they most severely botched everything by making the enemies insufficiently aggressive. Quite often monsters will just sort of stand there and mill about as I shoot ones that are a few feet nearer to me. Boss fights consist of running to the edge of the boss's guard zone, and stepping back whenever the enemy gets too close, making them run away.\n\nIf you want a challenge in this game, try to get a bunch of monsters to follow you at once so you can fireball a whole group: you'll have to run right past their noses to get them even slightly interested.","November 14, 2015","false","2.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","2"

Maybe I've been spoiled by Skyrim but this game is just not fun for me. My biggest issue is the inventory system. The inventory system should be a minor portion of the game experience but its major in this game. It's icon based like Divinity II and Deus Ex but unlike Divinity II you are only given 60 icon slots and one magic staff takes up 10 of them (17%). And unlike Deus Ex you can't rotate items around to try to fit them in so you can never use up all of the slots. So you end up spending most of your time going back and forth between vendors and the environment.\n\nWhen dealing with vendors you basically have three choices:\nDo I spend half my gold to buy an item that is only marginally better than the item I have but I can use it right now?\nDo I spend all of my gold to buy an item that is significantly better than the item I have and keep it in my limited inventory for about three level-ups before I can use it (and hope that something better doesn't come along in the mean time)?\nDo I buy nothing at all and hope for a better drop somewhere (knowing that better drops are few and far between)?\nIn 11+ hours of play I have opted for number three all but once.\n\nWhen not dealing with vendors the combat (and navigation) is just a series of left clicks with a couple of right clicks and 0-9 spell casts thrown in... Meh.\n\nThe quests and the map are completely linear with typically one major and one minor quest target at any one time. So your only decisions in the game are do I do the major quest first or the minor quest first? But it doesn't matter what you choose because there are no quest targets on the map. But don't worry, the map is small enough that you won't have to wander around long before you stumble upon one of the quest targets.\n\nPlan on playing for at least an hour or two each session unless you like killing the same enemies over and over again because it's checkpoint based. There is a Save button in the Options menu but I haven't figured out what it does. No matter where you save you will respawn at the latest checkpoint (rebirth fountain) you have found the next time you start the game.\n\nI'm giving up now to try something else. I'll start a fifth play-through of Skyrim before I'll try this game again.\n\nGlenowen.\n","July 14, 2014","false","13.8"," 8 of 21 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","8","21","0","1"

With a few exceptions, it's a mediocre dungeon crawler. The two-class system is great and allows for a lot of customization. You pick one of eight classes when you start a character, and a second class at level 8. After that, you are free to put points into either classes' skill trees as you see fit. Unfortunately, the enjoyability of this system is hindered by excrutiatingly slow progress. I stuck with it for 36 hours, which only got me about 20 levels and half way through the campaign. The main problem with level progression comes from the skill point system. Each level, you are given 3 skill points. This seems like a lot, but you also have to put these points into your classes to unlock skill tiers. This means that if you put one point into each class every level, you only get one point per level for your skills until the classes cap at 32. Keep in mind that after 36 hours, I only reached level 21. Aside from the leveling system and ancient Greek setting, Titan Quest is generic in every way. It really isn't a bad game, but the painfully slow advancement will drive away all but the most dedicated of players.","January 27, 2014","false","36.3"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

The skill-tree system is bland and there are various small bugs throughout the game, though none are game-breaking except one: you will randomly have your characters deleted.  Yes, you heard me right.  The game studio is no longer in business, so expect that this will never be rectified.

Starting with the third act the game gets harder and gaining levels takes far too long. The items that drop don't make up for it either. About half way through the third act I ran into the 'dead end' for me. A new enemy type appears that I can barely fight 1-on-1 and once three of them are around I'm dead within 5 seconds. The difficulty curve is far from being optimal and it can be quite frustrating if you get stuck in the middle of the third act. Also most of the interesting side quests from the first two acts are absent.\n\nIf you're an experienced Diablo player this one is certainly worth a play, but if you consider yourself a more casual action RPG player, I'd recommend to play Torchlight instead.","February 2, 2014","false","50.7"," 10 of 28 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","10","28","0","0"

Performance issues aside ( I own a midrange computer anyway), this game ain't that great.\nThis review is based on the single player experience (multiplayer is dead anyway).\nLet's first talk about the squandered setting. Ancient Greece, Egypt, Persia and China sound like magnificent places to have a good old hack-n-slash. And in the beginning you're fighting satyrs and cyclops. Good start. Then the skeletons come. And the birds. And the boars. And the tiger creatures. And the rat creatures. Yawn.  Also most of the game is spent traversing generic countryside while traveling from city to city; the landscape has its waterfall-and-rope-bridge moments, but it's basically boring grassland after boring forest followed by boring desert and boring mountains. And the monsters are exactly what you would expect to find in those places based on almost every other hack-n-slash I've ever played. The game is quite long for the money and some of the cities and temples are cool (if few and VERY far between), but it might as well be based in modern-day America.\nThe gameplay is balls-boring slash-loot-repeat. The only interesting bits are when you summon minions to help with the fighting, but then when said summoning skill is leveled up enough you'll find that the minions are doing most of the fighting for you. And then they get in the way when you try to collect loot. So not only are you not that involved in the game anymore, the game can actually prevent you from playing!\nAnd the #1 problem: it's so easy, even on hard. As the Wanderer I breezed through the 60-or-so hours it took to reach the final boss... where the difficulty spiked tremendously! I get that final bosses are supposed to be hard, but after being insta-killed about 30 times I pretty much just gave up. The rest of the game may not have been meant solely for co-op, but it sure seems like the final boss was. I felt taken: "Oh, didn't care for the slog it took to get here? Well now we'll make it so you can never complete the game! HAH!"\nReplay value? Forget it!\nI got this game and its presumably better sequel on sale for a ridiculous price ($2.50 USD) and was, in the end, disappointed anyway. The other reviewers are right; just play Diablo II. Or FATE; that's a good one too.","December 5, 2014","false","86.4"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","0"

But after getting 5 hours in, I just had to beat it. I blame my completionist tendencies. The worst part is that I basically played the first 5 hours over and over and over again. That's how copypasta this thing is.\n\nAnd the end game? Jesus F Christ. I've never seen so much HP bloat in my life. It was apparently made even harder for the version on Steam. Finally beat it after my stock of Mana and Health potions went down to 15 or so from the original 100. And the ending was so ♥♥♥♥ing underwhelming. I mean it's an ARPG, but for the sheer boredom in finishing this thing you'd think the devs would offer to come over and suck your genitalia or something.\n\nWell congrats Titan Quest. You have broken my 8 month long ARPG fever. I played 56 hours of Torchlight and it was so fun. I replayed Diablo and still had tons of entertainment. I even enjoyed the art in Bastion. But you take the cake Titan Quest. You wasted 52 hours of my precious time and took advantage of my completion tendencies. I don't think I'll be playing an ARPG anytime in the next couple of months.

This game is just generic in waves and is missing every single thing that made every action in Diablo 3 convenient and immensely enjoyable to play (like auto gold pickup to name one).

The only enemies that provide any real challenge are the bosses or bigger mobs with AOE attacks.  Graphics are okay, but pretty dated.  Voice acting is okay, but not great.  Some of the actors do not pull off different ethnicities very well and sound more like parodies.  The checkpoint system isn't the best, as you may have to do a fair bit of trekking back to your last location if you die.  Difficulty ramps up significantly toward the end, to the point where the end boss is incredibly difficult.

Two things make it very difficult for me to even complete the game: (1) Too many passives abilities vs active abilities make you feel less in control of the combat,  (2)  Potions have no cooldown, so the only strategy you need to employ is having enough potions for any given fight.\n\nBecause of that the combat feels bland and repetitive from quite an early point in the game, and I just can't be bothered to finish it.\n\nOn the plus side, the graphics are quite good.  Combat feels nice and responsive, especially with the weight added by the physics engine.  The story is okay, with decent voice acting.  The skill trees are interesting, especially as you can combine any two core classes.\n\nI'm looking forward to Grim Dawn, the spiritual successor to Titan Quest from the same developers.

However, Titian Quest is full of so many small flaws that add up to a seriously flawed game that's difficult to enjoy.\n\nFrom the get-go sustaining your character is a problem.  Mana runs out too fast, health runs out too fast, inventory fills up too fast, so many pauses and breaks are necessary.  Items that drop are of very little monetary value so building wealth can be difficult, gear from the NPC vendors is often prohibitively expensive.  Your characters progress feels very slow, leveling up takes longer than it seems like it aught to, especially early on.  Gear upgrades don't seem to help very much.\nAs you go on, your character seems increasingly ill equipped without going back and grinding things you already killed.  That is typically not a necessary part of an Action RPG (a gold standard to compare to in my mind would be Torchlight, where your character goes straight through without killing anything twice, and yet is always appropriately leveled and geared for the content).\nThese elements are all signs of half-♥♥♥♥♥ design.\n\nThere are much better Action RPGs on the market, save your money and avoid Titan Quest.","November 26, 2013","false","18.2"," 16 of 54 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","16","54","0","1"

A major appeal for me was seeing ancient Greece, Egypt, Babylon and China. These settings were more interesting than generic fantasy-world levels and, along with the great variety of unusual mobs, kept me motivated to see more. There is plenty of bang for the buck; my playthrough took nearly 40 hours.\n\nItem drops and customizations are not as useful/interesting as in 'Diablo' or 'Torchlight.' On the other hand, customization is also easier to understand and perform. The skill trees offer a wide variety of character builds.\n\nAt 'normal' setting, combat was rarely challenging, then culminated in an overwhelming boss that, for me, required some cheesing to beat. I expect such balance issues are familiar to any action-RPGers. Goes with the territory.\n\nIf you're a fan of the genre, I recommend this mythological spin on 'Diablo' as a good value with an attractive, unconventional game world.","January 1, 2015","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I picked this up on sale for around $5 and it is one of the best buys I've made on Steam. I will not compare it to Diablo, but it is every bit as good as other popular RPGs of the Diablo ilk. For instance, I am a fan of the Sacred games, but I actually think Titan Quest is a superior game. The story is solid; bosses are formidable; voice overs are very good; graphics are good for this type of game; weapons, upgrades, and spells are copious; skill sets are very nice; it has a decent amount of side quests without going overboard (talking to you Sacred); and the overall mechanics of the game are very smooth.\n\nA couple of points about the game: Skill management is important as you only get to pick two skill sets out of about ten (one at level 2 and one at level 8), and then you must utilize your skill points appropriately as you will discover that some spells and attributes are more useful than others. If there is one downside in my view it is that there is no storage to stash your loot. Some may find this a plus since it induces you to manage your inventory carefully, but I found myself dropping very nice stuff to make room for other goods, and I spent way too much time debating whether to do so or not. Other than that, I have no qualms about this game.\n\nVerdict: This is a very nice game that is well worth its price, and definitely a steal if you pick it up on sale.","January 2, 2015","true","52.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then I turned into a golem summoning, fireball throwing, archer that cannot be stopped! It is an absolute blast to play this game with some awesome bosses and critters to smash to smitherines! Warning, the Cyclops DOES indeed stomp you into a fine jelly-like substance. Plus, there is a whole expansion known as "Immortal Throne" which adds a whole new dungeon crawling experience in Hades and adds some new skill trees. I wouldn't want to spoil what I felt playing this game for the first time so here I suggest either trying a demo or just buying it (seriously, awesome game).","October 13, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The setting is rich without being wordy or overly complicated.  The combat works and I never experienced slowdown despite some heavy numbers onscreen.\n\nCons: This game is just too long for haveing so simple a mechanic.  I was begging it to end a few times when it instead moved me to another location to mindlessly dispose of another thousand baddies.  If it would have been half as long I would have given it a star more.  Remember that every game can be 100 hours if they just never end; it's rarely a good thing.\n\nRating: ***1/2 / *****","February 19, 2015","true","81.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The skill progression allows for a lot of flexibility with classes so you can work towards making any combination work in a fun way.

It follows the basic lines of Diablo/Torchlight and other hack & slash games where the basis of the game is building a character from one of many classes and then collecting loot/equipment to help them succeed thru the levels.\n\nI'm not sure if this is a complaint or if it's something that I admire in the game, or maybe a bit of both.  Basically it's almost impossible under any build to lose in the initial first two passes.  It's only the third go around where most builds fail.  Once you get into the third go around it is equipment based.  It mostly doesn't matter how well you've built the character.  With the wrong equipment, you lose.  There are a very few exceptions to this but by and large the game becomes equipment centric.\n\nI suppose what I dislike is having invested so many hours to find the build a failure because the wrong loot dropped.  what I admire is that it actually drove me to try again.   I had played it thru numerous times (some successful, some failures) before I read anyone's builds.  The fun part of reading someone else's build is finding how they combines the different skills.  I would however suggest trying it on your own.  If your objective is simply to win. there are a couple of builds that will pretty much clean up. You won't get them from me as it's just too much of a spoiler.\n\nAnd for the faint of heart who can't bring themselves to start anew, there are editors out there that allow changing just about anything - I suggest avoiding them until you've played thru at least once otherwise you'll lose what's best about the game.\n","July 21, 2014","true","111.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have two options - Run at you stabbing or stand in one spot casting spells. ---Just repeat this experiance through all sorts of beautiful levels and using awesome magic/attacks to kill them.  It is as though the player, skills, and graphics are all awesome... but the monsters you use them on are kinda on the meh I dont care level. --- Also the difficulty swings widly from level to level and once you start the 2nd quest everything kind of cheats.

Like many quests, it involves doing things. In this case, you have to be very titan to survive the waves of innocent skeletons and mythical goats.\n\nI won't spoil too much, but indeed you need your all strenght to be titan and kill goats. Few of the goats are bosses with special skills and attributes.\n\nThese goats like to drop items that are made out of pure gold. For some reason these golden items are worth more than white ones. Even though I'm pretty sure that white gold is more valuable. Not sure though. Actually who would make weapons and armor out of gold? Gold is not very durable material and it's heavy.\n\nYes the name of the items usually refer to some cheaper and more convenient materials like bronze or iron, but it's a lie. Because always yellow = gold and white = white gold. Common knowledge in these titan circles.\n\nYou can also get a pet if you're lucky. I got myself a green wolf. I named him Duke of Sparta (aka DOS). Duke wasn't a smart wolf. He often got left behind and was killed by goats. Luckily he was easily replaced. In my case, by pressing number 1 key on the keyboard. I was very dissapointed when I found out that I can only have one duke at the time.","December 23, 2012","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Tried it when I first bought it and was a little underwhelmed so didn't put too much play time into it. Recently gave it a second a chance and am really glad I did. Would definitely go into my top five dungeon crawler games. Most other reviews cover all the positive aspects so I won't bother going into that.\n\nMy only downside to this game from my experience is that while there is a rich variety of loot to be found, I don't believe it drops often enough or consistently enough (it's the blue items I'm talking about here, the epic unique ones). No one else has mentioned this in their reviews so maybe I was just unlucky, or maybe it's just something that bothers me personally. I'm not saying the gear didn't drop for me, but the majority of it was not for my class. I can't possibly see how you can complete a five/six piece armour set with the drop rates the way that they were for me. Plus when I defeated the last boss (which I found to be fairly challenging compared to the rest of the game), not a single piece of epic loot dropped, it was just all generic useless items that weren't even worth checking as I knew my current gear would be better. So that was annoying. But as I say this might just be a pet peeve of mine and in no way damages the game.\n\nWould definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this genre.","June 10, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like many quests, it involves doing things. In this case, you have to be very titan to survive the waves of innocent skeletons and mythical goats.\n\nI won't spoil too much, but indeed you need your all strenght to be titan and kill goats. Few of the goats are bosses with special skills and attributes.\n\nThese goats like to drop items that are made out of pure gold. For some reason these golden items are worth more than white ones. Even though I'm pretty sure that white gold is more valuable. Not sure though. Actually who would make weapons and armor out of gold? Gold is not very durable material and it's heavy.\n\nYes the name of the items usually refer to some cheaper and more convenient materials like bronze or iron, but it's a lie. Because always yellow = gold and white = white gold. Common knowledge in these titan circles.\n\nYou can also get a pet if you're lucky. I got myself a green wolf. I named him Duke of Sparta (aka DOS). Duke wasn't a smart wolf. He often got left behind and was killed by goats. Luckily he was easily replaced. In my case, by pressing number 1 key on the keyboard. I was very dissapointed when I found out that I can only have one duke at the time.","December 23, 2012","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vandalcain/recommended/4540/","vandalcain","V4ND4L","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vandalcain/","421 products in account","First, when you buy Titan Quest Gold, you get Immortal Throne. That should be the version you play. Not the main game. If you opt to play the main game first, you will have to repeat the entire main game again just to get to the Immortal Throne content. There is no reason to play the core game first. Hopefully, someone will read this and not waste an incredible amount of time.\n\nTitan Quest is a Diablo clone. But a damn good one. In fact, despite its age, I find it far more satisfying than Diablo III. The game plays in the same isometric aerial view with a slight ability to zoom in or out (not by much). Action is exactly the same: point and click to move or hold the mouse down to run constantly. Shift stops you in your tracks for range attack. As in Diablo and other loot games, such as Borderlands, one of this game's main appeals is in the loot drops. Unlike Diablo II, the levels are not randomly generated, however they will respawn after time giving them some replay value. The loot aspect gives it immense replay value.\n\nYou upgrade your character with core ability increases, which allow you to perform better and also equip better gear. There is a robust skill tree system that allows you to pick from a wide variety of "classes" (hunter, warrior, nature, etc). These different classes provide you with hot button skills to kill better, heal yourself, or summon allies. As you progress, you will be allowed to pick up other classes which you can then spend your skill points on or save them for your primary class. The ability to define your character with these attributes, skills, and gear makes Titan Quest an amazingly fun game.\n\nThe setting is Ancient Greece and is steeped heavily in mythological lore. The nice thing about Titan Quest is that the graphics are pretty damned good and it is mixed with entertaining sound effects and music. The voice acting is really good and while a lot of the NPC's you talk to in the various towns throughout the empire have little to do with the game, they provide some very good flavor. Of note, there are merchants in towns that will sometimes focus on particular types of gear - some specialize in blades, some in ranged, some in magic. Most will have a little of everything though.\n\nThroughout the game you will find pieces of relics that you can assemble to form the entire relic. These relics can be attached to certain types of gear to further drastically improve their effects. Once you lock it onto a weapon, you can pay certain NPC's in town to break it off the gear or break the gear off of the charm/relic, but one way or the other - either the armor or the charm/relic is destroyed. Your pick. So, choosing which relics to match up with which gear is pivotal. Also, it isn't cheap to do this, so you want to apply these to good pieces of gear.\n\nThere are plenty of side quests to do and most all of them are really fun. In addition, there are Points of Interest that aren't necessarily quests, but beg you to explore that area of the map. As a fog of war fills in the map, exploration is tantalizing.\n\nTitan Quest is a very fun game that I played the hell out of many years ago and recently picked back up on Steam. I wasn't disappointed. You will get a lot of fun out of this game and plenty of replay value (once beaten, you can replay on harder difficulty for greater loot). It has a fun co-op mode too that requires the players to really share the loot, as it plays like Borderlands (first come, first serve).

Many years before I played Runescape so it was fast to get used to.\nThe graphics are awesome! simple but so beautiful. I felt in love with that.\nThe game itself is so hard, and I am playing in the lowest dificulty level(normal). Maybe I've chose the hardest classes (Hunter and Rogue), but it's how I am, I love hunting and I LOVE stealh games, so I created a characther that looks like me, which is very cool in a game having multiple classes. One thing that I didn't like is that the map is too linear, I mean, it's huge, but if you look at all the entire map, it's a huge line.\n\nI recommend this game with all my strengh.

The different combinations of characters you can create is amazing, and you need to put thought into each skill point and stat allocation. The combat is generally much slower paced than games like diablo 2 or torchlight 2 and I for one am happier for it. The general mobs are tougher and instead of cutting through hundreds you are only encountering mobs of anywhere from two to twenty. Combat is satisfying once you have unlocked a few skills to make use of, and dare I say there are even tactical consierations!? Though the lack of an M rating means that there is no blood or dismemberment, the use of ragdoll physics sort of makes up for it.\n\nThe magical effects in this game are great, too many games in this genre overdo the particles and the glows and whatever else. This game keeps it basic. The special effects never get in the way of seeing what is going on.\n\nThe game world itself is amazingly detailed with grass that moves as you step through it, and water that ripples as it is disturbed. Even arrows can cause the tall grass to shake as they fly through. The little details really make this world one of the best in the genre. The lack of loading screens between locations is another thing that really makes this game feel special. It's a nice feeling actually walking into a cave or dungeon, clearing it, and then walking out seamlessly. The game world is top notch.\n\nI do have a few issues with the user interface as it can be rather clunky at times, but it's not as terrible as some professional reviewers have made it out to be. I do highly reccomend getting some form of voice chat if you are playing with a friend in coop because the chat in game is terrible.\n\nTo sum it up this is a game that exceeds expectations for it's genre in all of the areas that matter, and in my opinion the meta critic review of 77 is nothing short of criminal.","June 2, 2013","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just the joy that you have slicing and slashing through hordes of mythological creatures, including Satyrs, Harpies, Cyclops, Typhon, the most powerful titan, and even the king of the underworld himself; Hades. You will not only enjoy fighting your most darkest adversaries, but also finding the most epic of loot. This game features thousands of different items you can find across the land. Speaking of land, this game takes place over Ancient Greece, Egypt, and Asia. At each stop, different opponents will greet you (by that I mean try and rip you to shreds). Not only is this game fun, but it is also a type of learning game. Like me, I found out about a lot of Ancient Greek mythology by playing this game. Most areas in this game are real places in this geographical area of the world. For example, in the first act (Greece) some of the towns include Delphi, Athens, Sparta, etc. The boss fights are also exhilarating. After almost every main boss there is a chest (or in some cases an orb) which can be opened, and in them are magical items that when dropping are completely randomized. Because of this randomization, every time you play, you should expect a new experience to emerge. Each time you play, you find new items, become a new hero, and save the world. The multiplayer works out fine, but when playing with friends, I recommend sharing your classes so that you can come up with the best class setup between you. What are the classes you ask? The classes include Storm, Earth, Warfare, Spirit, Defense, Hunting, Nature, and Rogue. Once you reach level two, you can pick your first class. Then, at level eight, you can pick your second class. After that, you will no longer be able to choose a different class on the same character. It's a Fun game and truly does bring out the adventerous side of you. Mortals, save all of humanity in... Titan Quest!","December 29, 2013","true","21.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My few hours I got to spend with my college buds on Diablo II were some of the best that semester.  Magicka remains on my top 10 of games this last decade.\n\nI am also a REALLY big fan of Mythology...not kidding, when I found out that most schools didn't teach it I was heartbroken and felt sad for them, because I was lucky enough to get that amazing taste of Mythology due to my schooling.  The "Big Three," Greeks Egyptians and Vikings, were really good favorites of mine, but in today's world I particularly love Egyptian Mythology (in no small part due to living there) so when I found out that this game didn't JUST have accurate Greek mythical creatures to fight, I was stoked.  Definitely going to finish this.\n\nOut of the box, here are the pros and cons!\n\n-Pros\n\n+Historical and Mythological Accuracy; harpies are bad guys, satyrs hate your guts, the undead are clad in bronze armor, and the like\n+Diverse locals; Greece, Crete, Egypt, most of the Mediterranean is covered in this game, and more!\n+HARDCORE boss fights; if you aren't prepared and have looked up some of the details on these bosses beforehand, you will get your butt kicked a lot...and in a good way, forcing you to change your tactics you like to use for other critters\n+Loot; this is probably the best loot I've seen in any game, though I'm sure this is a normal thing for Hack and Slashes.  It's nice knowing that I have a ready supply of gold I can farm and go back to by getting weapons I don't need for my class and selling them at a merchant\n+Class Customization; The fact that they managed to implement traditional class systems in a way that makes sense to the lore by means of class customization is the best aspect of this game.  I'm currently playing a hunter with defense and never before have I appreciated the use of a bow more in a game where my primary purpose is to be a tanky melee fighter.\n\nCons\n-It's a bit dated...not so much to prevent fun replayability, but just enough to catch your attention.  An HD glossover of this game would be an amazing addition\n-Lacking in character customization; Changing your shirt color and skin/hair color, pretty much it...kind of sad, especially since I wanted to look like either a Spartan or a Thracian in appearance.\n- Class system kind of wonks out in historical accuracy; I chose hunter and defense so I could be a hoplite, my favorite historical troop choice in any Greek-themed game, and I hold my spear overhead as if I'm going to throw it...kind of a turnoff\n\nAll in all, I give this game an 8.5/10, and I will DEFINITELY update this review when I finally finish it.","October 14, 2014","true","36.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vandalcain/recommended/4540/","vandalcain","V4ND4L","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vandalcain/","421 products in account","First, when you buy Titan Quest Gold, you get Immortal Throne. That should be the version you play. Not the main game. If you opt to play the main game first, you will have to repeat the entire main game again just to get to the Immortal Throne content. There is no reason to play the core game first. Hopefully, someone will read this and not waste an incredible amount of time.\n\nTitan Quest is a Diablo clone. But a damn good one. In fact, despite its age, I find it far more satisfying than Diablo III. The game plays in the same isometric aerial view with a slight ability to zoom in or out (not by much). Action is exactly the same: point and click to move or hold the mouse down to run constantly. Shift stops you in your tracks for range attack. As in Diablo and other loot games, such as Borderlands, one of this game's main appeals is in the loot drops. Unlike Diablo II, the levels are not randomly generated, however they will respawn after time giving them some replay value. The loot aspect gives it immense replay value.\n\nYou upgrade your character with core ability increases, which allow you to perform better and also equip better gear. There is a robust skill tree system that allows you to pick from a wide variety of "classes" (hunter, warrior, nature, etc). These different classes provide you with hot button skills to kill better, heal yourself, or summon allies. As you progress, you will be allowed to pick up other classes which you can then spend your skill points on or save them for your primary class. The ability to define your character with these attributes, skills, and gear makes Titan Quest an amazingly fun game.\n\nThe setting is Ancient Greece and is steeped heavily in mythological lore. The nice thing about Titan Quest is that the graphics are pretty damned good and it is mixed with entertaining sound effects and music. The voice acting is really good and while a lot of the NPC's you talk to in the various towns throughout the empire have little to do with the game, they provide some very good flavor. Of note, there are merchants in towns that will sometimes focus on particular types of gear - some specialize in blades, some in ranged, some in magic. Most will have a little of everything though.\n\nThroughout the game you will find pieces of relics that you can assemble to form the entire relic. These relics can be attached to certain types of gear to further drastically improve their effects. Once you lock it onto a weapon, you can pay certain NPC's in town to break it off the gear or break the gear off of the charm/relic, but one way or the other - either the armor or the charm/relic is destroyed. Your pick. So, choosing which relics to match up with which gear is pivotal. Also, it isn't cheap to do this, so you want to apply these to good pieces of gear.\n\nThere are plenty of side quests to do and most all of them are really fun. In addition, there are Points of Interest that aren't necessarily quests, but beg you to explore that area of the map. As a fog of war fills in the map, exploration is tantalizing.\n\nTitan Quest is a very fun game that I played the hell out of many years ago and recently picked back up on Steam. I wasn't disappointed. You will get a lot of fun out of this game and plenty of replay value (once beaten, you can replay on harder difficulty for greater loot). It has a fun co-op mode too that requires the players to really share the loot, as it plays like Borderlands (first come, first serve). Buy with confidence!","January 5, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The different combinations of characters you can create is amazing, and you need to put thought into each skill point and stat allocation. The combat is generally much slower paced than games like diablo 2 or torchlight 2 and I for one am happier for it. The general mobs are tougher and instead of cutting through hundreds you are only encountering mobs of anywhere from two to twenty. Combat is satisfying once you have unlocked a few skills to make use of, and dare I say there are even tactical consierations!? Though the lack of an M rating means that there is no blood or dismemberment, the use of ragdoll physics sort of makes up for it.\n\nThe magical effects in this game are great, too many games in this genre overdo the particles and the glows and whatever else. This game keeps it basic. The special effects never get in the way of seeing what is going on.\n\nThe game world itself is amazingly detailed with grass that moves as you step through it, and water that ripples as it is disturbed. Even arrows can cause the tall grass to shake as they fly through. The little details really make this world one of the best in the genre. The lack of loading screens between locations is another thing that really makes this game feel special. It's a nice feeling actually walking into a cave or dungeon, clearing it, and then walking out seamlessly. The game world is top notch.\n\nI do have a few issues with the user interface as it can be rather clunky at times, but it's not as terrible as some professional reviewers have made it out to be. I do highly reccomend getting some form of voice chat if you are playing with a friend in coop because the chat in game is terrible.\n\nTo sum it up this is a game that exceeds expectations for it's genre in all of the areas that matter, and in my opinion the meta critic review of 77 is nothing short of criminal.","June 2, 2013","true","24.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt in love with that.\nThe game itself is so hard, and I am playing in the lowest dificulty level(normal). Maybe I've chose the hardest classes (Hunter and Rogue), but it's how I am, I love hunting and I LOVE stealh games, so I created a characther that looks like me, which is very cool in a game having multiple classes. One thing that I didn't like is that the map is too linear, I mean, it's huge, but if you look at all the entire map, it's a huge line.\n\nI recommend this game with all my strengh. At the beginning it's weird to play, no classes, you just start with a small knife, you must stole armor from dead enemies, but as long you play, more fun it gets.","June 27, 2013","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Get the complete package and jump straight into Immortal Throne. Here's my review of that, copied and pasted for your viewing pleasure:\n\n"After Diablo convinced me I hated ARPGs, TQ is what finally changed my mind. Every time I think I'm done with it, someone else I know starts playing, or I hear about a new build on the forums, and I end up putting another 20-50 hours in. It's my most-played game on Steam for a reason. It does have a rather slow start before it really gets going, but I'm a really big fan of the multiclass system. The sheer number of weird combinations available has kept me trying them just to see if I can make them work. Make sure to grab the fan patch from the TQ forums, which fixes a bunch of things the devs didn't get a chance to before the studio shut down."","January 29, 2012","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tried it when I first bought it and was a little underwhelmed so didn't put too much play time into it. Recently gave it a second a chance and am really glad I did. Would definitely go into my top five dungeon crawler games. Most other reviews cover all the positive aspects so I won't bother going into that.\n\nMy only downside to this game from my experience is that while there is a rich variety of loot to be found, I don't believe it drops often enough or consistently enough (it's the blue items I'm talking about here, the epic unique ones). No one else has mentioned this in their reviews so maybe I was just unlucky, or maybe it's just something that bothers me personally. I'm not saying the gear didn't drop for me, but the majority of it was not for my class. I can't possibly see how you can complete a five/six piece armour set with the drop rates the way that they were for me. Plus when I defeated the last boss (which I found to be fairly challenging compared to the rest of the game), not a single piece of epic loot dropped, it was just all generic useless items that weren't even worth checking as I knew my current gear would be better. So that was annoying. But as I say this might just be a pet peeve of mine and in no way damages the game.\n\nWould definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this genre.","June 10, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So learning the game, especially for Diablo and similar game players will be easy.  The story is not particularly complicated, but it is strng enough to add some flavor to the combat.\n\nPro:  There are a series of "classes" you can follow, and the levelling up skill trees are clever and well designed.  In addition, you end up taking 2 classes, which allow for an excellent ability to customze the character to your style of play, and also allow you to gain a lot more replay as you move from melee to ranged to hybrid.  The specific skills have your standard passive/active and attacks/defenses, but there are also some very interesting and fun skills as well.\n\nCon:  The game is dated.  If you have been playing recent MMOs or Action RPGs, this does not have the impressive special effects that you see in their skill execution.  ALso, the equipment is visually designed to be more realistic than impressive, and the dyes only affect your tunic, which you never see.\n\nYou will amass PLENTY of money, so i encourage you to avoid picking up the gray items after lvl 3 for resale.  You will get plenty of coin as you go, so dont be afrid to puchase upgraded equipment when you find it and potions. Also, th drops will be very good, but unfortunatelythere is no way to share them amongst your characters (another example of the game being dated).  So you should be pleased with your equip, but annoyed when you sell a unique off simply because you cant really use it.\n\nThe monsters are fun, with solid visual identity and variation as well as variance in attacking and style.  They did a very nice job of making each of the key areas have a unique feel.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game for folks who like to have a solid action rpg withut a huge amount of complexity.\n\n","May 10, 2014","true","64.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It had somehow managed to keep me interested all the way to the end. I’ll tell you right now, it was all about the loot. Nothing to do with story, because the story in this game is bare bones basic (but well appreciated with decent voice acting). Nothing to do with graphics (but the way the enemies die like fluffy ragdolls did entertain me). It had everything to do with the way the game handled its loot system (although still flawed since you can farm some bosses through a glitch where they re-spawn every time you boot up your game; was this intended… or what?).\n\nThe game holds your hand throughout the game but does so in a very subtle manner. Quests are straightforward and all you have to do is go in a straight line and kill things. It did get stale near the end but just when I was thinking of throwing the game and moving on, I realized, based on my quest log, that I was near the end of the game. That and the enemies were 5-10 levels away from me. The final boss was hard enough for me to re-configure my special abilities in the right places and that gave me a satisfying victory. There is more to the game due to higher difficulties opening up but I think, for me, 53 hours is enough.\n\nSummary:This is the kind of game that very slowly increases in difficulty as you play. It doesn’t push too hard with its concepts but at the same time if you pull too much (by ignoring the most basic "right in your face" things), the game can overwhelm you, especially if you try to rush it.\n\nWorth: Get if cheap or get it at full price, no matter what you will get your money’s worth with this titan of a game. There’s a level editor too!\n\nLast Thoughts: I’m ready for the next challenge!","April 17, 2015","true","53.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A major appeal for me was seeing ancient Greece, Egypt, Babylon and China. These settings were more interesting than generic fantasy-world levels and, along with the great variety of unusual mobs, kept me motivated to see more. There is plenty of bang for the buck; my playthrough took nearly 40 hours.\n\nItem drops and customizations are not as useful/interesting as in 'Diablo' or 'Torchlight.' On the other hand, customization is also easier to understand and perform. The skill trees offer a wide variety of character builds.\n\nAt 'normal' setting, combat was rarely challenging, then culminated in an overwhelming boss that, for me, required some cheesing to beat. I expect such balance issues are familiar to any action-RPGers. Goes with the territory.\n\nIf you're a fan of the genre, I recommend this mythological spin on 'Diablo' as a good value with an attractive, unconventional game world.","January 1, 2015","true","39.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So, that being said, Titan Quest is a signigicantly better game than Diablo 3. A controversial statement, sure, but I feel like it captures the magic of Diablo 2, and goes a step further and sets it in a unique setting (as far as I know, ancient Greece hasn't been used in a D2 clone other than this). Combat is very similar to Diablo 2, but I like the skill trees in this game much more (especially when you unlock your second class). The monsters are interesting, the difficulty right on point, and once the good loot starts dropping, the treasures are awesome. And most of all, it really makes good use of the Greek setting and mythology.\n\nIn other words, you should own this game and play the hell out of it. I have nothing bad to say about it except for one little thing: I wish I had the Diablo-esque storage chest in every town. But the free town portal-like ability makes it somewhat less annoying, since dumping loot is easy.","January 23, 2015","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like many quests, it involves doing things. In this case, you have to be very titan to survive the waves of innocent skeletons and mythical goats.\n\nI won't spoil too much, but indeed you need your all strenght to be titan and kill goats. Few of the goats are bosses with special skills and attributes.\n\nThese goats like to drop items that are made out of pure gold. For some reason these golden items are worth more than white ones. Even though I'm pretty sure that white gold is more valuable. Not sure though. Actually who would make weapons and armor out of gold? Gold is not very durable material and it's heavy.\n\nYes the name of the items usually refer to some cheaper and more convenient materials like bronze or iron, but it's a lie. Because always yellow = gold and white = white gold. Common knowledge in these titan circles.\n\nYou can also get a pet if you're lucky. I got myself a green wolf. I named him Duke of Sparta (aka DOS). Duke wasn't a smart wolf. He often got left behind and was killed by goats. Luckily he was easily replaced. In my case, by pressing number 1 key on the keyboard.

Gorgeous locations, challenging bosses, combat that keeps you focused, an endlessly variable dual class and skill tree system, and that oh so handy inventory sorting button, amongst other features, have turned me from a skeptic sampler into an avid fan and appreciator of Iron Lore's work. A fun jaunt through Greek Myth doesn't hurt either. If you like ARPG's but aren't sure you can wait for Diablo 3, or you need a changeup from the frankly monotonous paces of Torchlight, Titan Quest and Immortal Throne, are worth giving a first, or even second look.

Another big word I know is DYNAMIC.\n\n+-Game map is huge, linear but with some side/exploration areas.  Good that there's a lot of content, bad that it takes a long time to move between it.  There are 7-8 waypoints per act, but several times as much space between them as in other similar games.  There are a few fountains in between each waypoint which you can activate as respawn points for when you die or log off/on (logging out of the game and back in will put you at the most recently tagged fountain and respawn all the mobs), but if you want to go back and farm the boss of Act 1, for instance, while there is a fountain a couple minutes away, if you want to go back and farm it later, you'll have a 10-15 minute run from the closest waypoint even if you don't stop to fight anything else.\n\n+-Lots of combat mechanics/multipliers/etc. to figure out.  This is good for people who like figuring out combat mechanics on their own.  Not so good for people who don't, as some of them are very confusing and many effects from skills and gear are not explained in-game, and while the ingame character panel is useful, it is incomplete and lacks several secondary resists.  Most people won't know or be able to find the difference between armor absorption and armor protection without looking it up.  The "average DPS" and damage per hit indicator only apply to a basic attack, and it is lacking in a "skill damage" indicator, so unless you fight primarily with basic attacks (which most classes don't, and have either a spammable skill or a technique that acts as a replacement for the basic attack), the damage readout will be completely inaccurate.  You cannot see your damage inflicted on enemies in numbers either, unless you toggle display critical hits, and then that only applies to melee; spells and bows cannot crit, and that damage also depends on the enemy's armor, resists, etc.\n\n+-Vanilla game is too easy.  I Recommend the Soulvizier mod, which makes trash mobs much more numerous and come in packs of 8 instead of 3, makes everything harder, bosses have more hp, and also raises the level cap and changes the class skills around quite a bit and adds a ton of items and recipes.  I played through the game on normal difficulty and probably would have stopped there from boredom without this mod--without it, there are just too few enemies and too much empty space in between bosses, and not much challenge.  This review would probably be a lot more negative without it.  (Difficulty is also similar to Diablo, normal<nightmare<legendary, each mode is just higher level and unlocks when you beat the one before it.)  Note that installing this mod will make any existing characters you have useless as it changes all the skills, and all of their skills will be at 0 but they will not get their skill points back.  This can be gotten around by using another mod called Defiler to edit your character to have the equivalent skills or unspent points.  I have not used Defiler myself.  Soulvizier also increases the base run speed of the player, which is very nice considering the huge size of the game and run speed being capped fairly low at 166%.\n\nSoulvizier requires the Immortal Throne expansion.  Getting Titan Quest Gold gives you both the base game and IT expansion.\n\nSoulvizier - http://www.moddb.com/mods/soulvizier\nDefiler - http://tq.soulseekkor.com/","February 28","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gorgeous locations, challenging bosses, combat that keeps you focused, an endlessly variable dual class and skill tree system, and that oh so handy inventory sorting button, amongst other features, have turned me from a skeptic sampler into an avid fan and appreciator of Iron Lore's work. A fun jaunt through Greek Myth doesn't hurt either. If you like ARPG's but aren't sure you can wait for Diablo 3, or you need a changeup from the frankly monotonous paces of Torchlight, Titan Quest and Immortal Throne, are worth giving a first, or even second look.

Tried it when I first bought it and was a little underwhelmed so didn't put too much play time into it. Recently gave it a second a chance and am really glad I did. Would definitely go into my top five dungeon crawler games. Most other reviews cover all the positive aspects so I won't bother going into that.\n\nMy only downside to this game from my experience is that while there is a rich variety of loot to be found, I don't believe it drops often enough or consistently enough (it's the blue items I'm talking about here, the epic unique ones). No one else has mentioned this in their reviews so maybe I was just unlucky, or maybe it's just something that bothers me personally. I'm not saying the gear didn't drop for me, but the majority of it was not for my class. I can't possibly see how you can complete a five/six piece armour set with the drop rates the way that they were for me. Plus when I defeated the last boss (which I found to be fairly challenging compared to the rest of the game), not a single piece of epic loot dropped, it was just all generic useless items that weren't even worth checking as I knew my current gear would be better. So that was annoying. But as I say this might just be a pet peeve of mine and in no way damages the game.\n\nWould definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this genre.","June 10, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Calamity wracks the land and ravening hordes of mythical creatures are attacking hapless tax-dodging villages all over Greece. In this hour of dire need, even the Spartan King Leonidas (taking a break from kicking innocent Persians into deep holes and prancing about in a leather jockstrap and cape) has joined forces with their ancient enemies the Greeks. Perhaps the Gods are sick of yet another Greek bailout, or perhaps the Centaurs are livid at being sold Horse Meat Lasagne. Who knows. Greece needs a mighty hero (and probably better Beef inspectors). Are you up to the challenge?\n\nPublished in 2006, TQ is an excellent Action RPG that has aged very well and a game I still play. To be properly playable, the expansion Immortal Throne is mandatory. As is the Titan Quest Fanpatch 1.17a, the Patchfix for Fanpatch 1.17, SSTQDefilerNET (RNG Function Fix, Slow Cast Fix) and TQ Vault (an out-of-game inventory management program to preserve your sanity). For truely mighty heroes, the following mods are recommended: 'm4ssboss3s-clean' and 'monsters-xmax'.","February 28, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
