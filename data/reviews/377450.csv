Will you manage to save the world and your son by preventing the Dark Lord to come back to life?\n\nWhile the story is common in the HOG world, it's still a good one and a well-written, as you'll be helped by spirits, ghosts and a dwarf.\n\nAnyway, the gameplay is the standard one: puzzles, hidden objects scenes, etc.. However, this game is quite interesting as the minigames are easy to solve and the hidden objects scenes are divided in three types: placing the object at the right place, finding the object corresponding at the silhouette and the traditionnal list of objects. However, each scene contains a close-up of a part of it - without forgetting the objects hidden in the scene that will require an action.\n\nThe graphics are correct, the backgrounds are also beautiful but after one moment, it was kinda long. Perhaps because I was in the mood of achievements hunting. Because the downside of the game are achievements. Some of them are quite hard to obtain despite the description - like the HO list without misclick. Given the nature of the list scenes, it's easier to unlock it in the bonus chapter, at the last HO because there was only one red item (hidden object). Also, I don't know why the painting games without misclick didn't unlock the first time as I never did a mistake.\n\nAnyway, the bonus are also good: puzzles, minigames to replay (and unlock achievements you may miss although the paitings ones isn't working), concept arts, etc..\n\nThe bonus chapter is set after the main chapter, though there is a little problem: your character has now long hair.... but in the cutscenes, she has short hair again as part of recycling movies.\n\nAnyway, the game is pretty good. It's a good and enjoyable one. I can recommend this one eyes closed.","January 12","true","7.4"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

It has only one significant flaw, the insane levels of backtracking.\n\nLong version:Building a good hidden object game, especially one that uses the most frequent setup in the genre (a mother’s son gets kidnapped by an unnamed dark entity, so she enters a magical forest and dark castle to save him) is a difficult task. Lost Lands: Dark Overlord managed to overcome this obstacle.\nIts greatest weapon to balance the fairly clichéd story was the graphics. They are not just eye candy (especially if we look at some of those impressive perspectives), but also a tool that helps the player to get immersed in this strange, yet somehow familiar fantasy world.\n\nAnother strong point is the puzzle design, especially the hidden object scenes. The game features three types: conventional list-based, item matching, and sequential (find objects to uncover more objects). Their variety alone is enough to excuse the somewhat ridiculous amounts and lengths of backtracking needed, even if said backtracking can really grind the player’s nerves towards the last stages.","February 9","true","7.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/377450/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1457 products in account","Review originally written for WalaWala Games[walawalagames.com]\n\nThis is a fairly typical hidden object styled game, and as such, both story and the general logic behind some of the puzzles and items to acquire follow a similar path (and thus, similar downfalls) to most other games of the genre: meaning it’s nothing original and logic flies out the window half the time.\nThat said, Lost Lands: Dark Overlord is definitely a bit above the average HOG game, and definitely on a good path.\n\nLet’s start with the audiovisual. The background art is really nice; they pay plenty of attention to background details, and most of the areas are really beautiful. The models and characters are pretty decent, but them, as well as the voices given to them, suffer from lack of expression. The characters ‘smile’ by hardly moving their mouths in an upward fashion, the mother’s re-encounter with her son goes only as far as a half heartfelt “Oh, jimmy.” and overall it’s just not the best. However, it’s also not the worst I’ve encountered, and you can kind of tell there was an attempt at giving some sort of emotional intonation to the text.\nThe cutscenes were alright too, though there were a couple ‘transitional’ ones that I’m not sure were really needed. The music was nice, soft enough that I was not bothered by it, and seemed to fit the setting.\n\nThe game has various difficulties: Easy/normal/hard plus a slightly custom one as you can select how fast or slow hints take to recharge and what you want ‘help’ with or not, which was a really nice addition.\n\nOnce in, you’ll find it also has many collectables to find throughout the areas in the main story, all of which were quite easy to spot - I’d think this lowers the replayability quite a bit, as completionists will surely not miss them on the first play through and thus would have no reason to go back and replay it.\n\nThere are several things I really enjoyed about it:\n\n+ It has a decent map system with fast travel - clicking on a map location takes you straight to it. The map also has the typical hints of where something needs doing and where you are, as well as an added hint of where you haven’t found a collectable yet (but only if you play it on easy, normal, or custom with those selected).\n\n+ There was a little ‘pet’ you find that helps you with getting certain items. I always enjoy when they add little companions because it somehow makes you not feel so ‘alone’.\n\n+ The customization choices for the difficulty (which I took full advantage of).\n\n+ The great variety of puzzles.\n\nThough most of the puzzles were a little too easy, I did enjoy playing through most of them. Lost Lands: Dark Overlord has a great variety, having only a few hidden object scenes (a couple by list, a couple by shape), some ‘logical pair’ scenes (flower with vase, etc), and puzzles ranging from slider to swapping to connecting and rearranging, to repair and/or reassemble the machine and a few recipe-based “make this item”, which I really like… It kept the game fresh not to have too many repeats.\n\nAnother interesting feature was that, in some of the puzzles where you first needed to find everal of an item, you would usually find most of those together in one single location. Some you still had to find separately, of course, but not having to find every single glass shard of a stained window, for instance, was actually quite nice.\n\nSomething I would have liked to have was for more of the ‘press things in a specific order’ puzzles to have the ability to put the little piece of paper with the order nearby to see it as you could in some of the rearranging puzzles. It got a bit tiresome having to open the book every time if you couldn’t recall the order.\n\nThe hidden object scenes were also rather easy, as some of the items stood out a bit too much (I seriously ended up getting at least half of them without even reading the list first).\n\nThere were no outstanding bugs through my gameplay, though my game did crash once (when I tried to switch from full screen to window in the middle of the game) and froze another time (for no reason whatsoever). Fortunately, it seems to have a pretty sturdy auto-saving system for I went back both times exactly to where I had left off and I was able to play on without major issues.\n\nThere was one thing that was a bit bothersome though, and that is: when you start the bonus chapter, on the initial sequence when she dreams about being needed, her hair is longer than on the main story; yet when she’s going through the portal and afterwards her hair is shorter again (and she’s wearing other clothes, too) as the cutscene was clearly reused from the main storyline. While I can see why the scene was reused, it was a bit of a sloppy thing that removed consistency in the storyline.\nI’m also confused as to why the initial dream sequence seems like it’s setting up the bonus as a horror story when it’s not, haha. Maybe that last was just me reading too much into it, though.\n\nI was lucky to get the Collector’s Edition to review. As usual, these come with a bunch of unlockable extras (wallpapers, concept art, etc), the choice to replay puzzles 8without having to replay the entire game), as well as the main story + bonus story (in which you go back to help some underwater beings from being extinct). The main story is fairly short, and the bonus is even shorter. With just around 3 hours of gameplay between both, Lost Lands: Dark Overlord might not be challenging or overly original, but it’s still fun to play.\n\nI’ll be looking forward to see how they improve on future releases!","July 13, 2015","true","4.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

(I would assume they are at home or she would have not taken the call I am sure.)  Susan, his mother, realizing her son has wandered off into the woods, goes after him only to see him being pulled into a mysterious swirling, glowing vortex in a tree trunk.  Before she can reach him he disappears in the tree trunk leaving only his teddy bear behind.  What does a concerned and tenacious mother do, she goes after him, of course.  Once she reaches the Lost Lands, as her new found dwarf friend explains, he also tells her an ancient evil has tainted the lands and in order to retrieve her son she must defeat this dark and evil presence.  Sure, no problem.  And with teddy bear in hand, she proceeds to do just that.\n\nGameplay: Mostly a point and click game but with enough hidden object scenes to keep it a hidden object game and plenty of puzzles.  Nothing too hard and the puzzles relatively easy. (Matching, sliders, circles, logic, color, recipe)  The game moves along in a relatively open world yet extremely linear fashion.  How can it be both, one may ask?  The linear movement of the story line moves along quite rapidly, however, the open world part comes into play because there are bottlenecks.  To get past each bottleneck the gamer must complete all the tasks needed to get past the bottleneck, which can be done in any order the gamer choses though limited to found inventory items.  Actually all the bottlenecks can be opened even before all tasks needed to complete the game are accomplished.  For an experienced HO gamer this should send up a little red flag that says 'backtracking', which there is a lot of if one missed something or the item in question can not be gotten yet.\n\nOn the subject of back tracking, there is a fast travel map.  But wait my friends, especially my achievement hunting friends, there are penalties, lots of them.  There are penalties for map use (and by default fast travel), for misclicks, for hints, for everything really, so pay attention to what one does or one will be playing the game more then once.  Ah yes, you read that correctly.  This game can be totally completed and ALL ACHIEVEMENTS EARNED in a SINGLE playthrough.  No forced second playthrough here, especially since there is a built in strategy guide in case one gets stuck.  So go ahead and play on the hard level the first time through.  There are even ACHIEVEMENTS IN the BONUS CHAPTER and some missed achievements can even be earned in the bonus chapter.  (Now that is a first for me, who has played HO games for 10+ years and owns well over a hundred HO games.)  Kudos to the developers, I really like that feature.\n\nA warning and caution for my achievement hunting friends, I suggest you actually read the achievements before playing because there are achievements 1) that are missable, 2) if over zealous and one only partially completes the puzzle (usually to get the stuff out of inventory) then leaves the puzzle the achievement is lost  (finding the shells immediately comes to mind ~ bonus chapter ~ ALL NINE shells need to placed on the 1st TRY and without any misclicks), 3) misclicks (One can lose several achievements over this. The fore mentioned one being one of them.) and 4) map use ~ limit 5 uses.  Advise: DO NOT USE THE MAP or one will be playing the game again.\n\nThere are extra hidden objects (with attached achievements, of course), four sets: snails, pine cones, skulls, and snakes.  These extra objects change as one progresses through the game (and the change can be used as an area marker) and overlap between area sections. (There are basically 4 areas: town, mine, castle, wizard's tower.)  These objects are easy to see and easy to find.  But they are also easy to miss if one forgets or in a transistion zone.  Fortunately there is a "tracking" button one can click on to see how many are needed or left to be found in the "area".\n\nEasy and challenging at the same time.  Fun, despite the backtracking.  Comes with built in strategy guide, has extras like wallpapers, concept art, music, plus 4 picture puzzles to do.  Well worth the price, plus it has a sequel game (Lost Lands: The Four Horsemen).  One last thing, I like the fact Susan wears glasses.  An unusual detail that stands out to me as both a cost to the developers and as a personal trait for the character.","December 19, 2015","true","14.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","4"

It has the right amount of hidden object scenes, puzzles and mini-games without getting either too lengthy or having too much of one of the three. The difficulty level is not too hard, but some of the mini-games and puzzles aren't that easy.\n\nThe graphics and music are really great. Every location has its own style while not becoming random and it's fun to explore the game. The pre-rendered 3D graphics look very detailed and colorful. While the voice acting is okay, the music fits the game very well and never gets on your nerves.\n\nThere are three different kinds of hidden object scenes and two of them require you to really think about the scene rather than just searching for the objects. I really enjoyed this change and it certainly adds to the adventure aspect. The puzzle elements range from 'find the right shape' to almost old school point and click ones. Again the more challenging puzzles keep the game interesting.\n\nThis is a real gem if you like casual adventure games and I was surprised how well designed (in both gameplay and presentation) the game is.","August 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I had a lot of fun playing this game, I even went through it twice to finish the achievements. It's a solid hidden object game with a decent enough story. It has plenty of challenge to keep you busy and has that "it" factor that makes you want to sit and play it for hours.\n\nThe story is a bit cliche. A demon has your son kidnapped and you go through great lengths to rescue him and become a hero to this magical land, you even get dragged back in the bonus chapter AND the sequel! One issue I found is that the demon is just like...a shadow or smoke figure so he can't actually ever hurt you or do anything. It seemed shockingly easy, story wise, to save the boy. However, it wasn't a bad story at all. Just typical hidden object fair.\n\nThe game play, however, was top notch. It was challenging and enjoyable at the same time. Lots of point and click aspects mixed in with hidden object scenes. The added Steam achievements create even more challenge if you're on a mission to collect them all. You also have a short, but still entertaining bonus chapter at the end of the main game. My biggest issue was the amount of back tracking. As one of the achievements is not use the map over five times, this leaves you endlessly going backwards then forwards a lot. Finding the item you need to finish a puzzle that is located at the beginning of the game can be a chore.\n\nOverall, the game is great.
