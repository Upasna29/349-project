I remember playing this as part of a 'gaming community' when it first released.  Before COH there was this gem and in a lot of ways it was, and still is, superior:\n\n- great story mode\n- cool voice acting\n- pretty decent graphics w/ awesome animations\n- great soundtrack\n\nAlso, Nordic Games resurrected MULTIPLAYER - no Gamespy :)\n\n9.7/10\n\n(-0.3 for some very minor issues with the 'options.ini' file)","February 19","true","2.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038466696/recommended/411310/","76561198038466696","Downright.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038466696/","142 products in account","Steam stubornly insists that it's thumbs up or thumbs down with the games it brings us.Codename:`Panzers,Phase One and the other two Panzer games in the package are prime examples of why more degrees of choice are required with some games.                                                                                                                                                                                                  Ok the AFV models are excellent,interesting odd ball types of vehicles cammed up nicely and there is a T26B(with a radio,wow) and BA-32-2 and I  think a VZ semi track recovery vehicle.Amazing!They look and move really well.                                                          But the spoken chat is truly terrible.Thanks, minion,that is the 1000th time you have told me the enemy is sighted in your annoyingly poofie voice.Worse is that sticking an "A"sound after an English word does not make it Italian.The acting in all three games is embarrasingly bad.                                                                                                                                       The maps are large enough and serve their purpose, they are OK.The missions are predictable but not silly.They are OK as well.The game itself looks old ,sure,but its clear and quite satisfactory.Battle sounds are fine.The music(part of the package) but obviously  not that stirring because I can not recollect any at all.Battles take  place at extremely close range.I know it's about scale but it just seems far too close..                                                                                                                                                              Apart from not running the opening scene unless you click,no problems ,glitches, slow load ups,or crashes, nah ,been none of that stuff. It runs fine on Windows 7x 64 bit.Its easy to find your way round the game and get into combat.             OK why the thumbs up? For me its  only  the interesting AFV which swings  that old digit upwards.There are much better games out there than this but this is ok. Not much else ;damned by faint praise perhaps....","February 18","true","0.4"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","17","25","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/olden_bread/recommended/411310/","olden_bread","Olden_bread","http://steamcommunity.com/id/olden_bread/","188 products in account","It is a classic strategy in 2 parts. Phase 1 almost equal to Phase 2, the only thing Phase 2 have done is new missions and Italy + Yugoslavia. Story is very well written, panzers themselves are good realized. Infantry is a bit sucky (it always so in classics).\nDespite being released in 2004, the game is good alternative to that Company of Heroes 2 shame. Campaing is more interesting, game is harder (if you choose hard mode your losses will be unrestorable) and it doesnt want you to buy stuff like generals etc.\nPS Russian voices are not very good. Pronounciacion is fine, but phrases sometimes ugly.","March 15","true","30.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Please take note PYRO with you pathetic Commando rereleases. The disastrous copy protection is gone. The graphics is bumped up to 1920 x 1080 at 144 Hz. The graphics are still good for 2016! Owning it on steam just makes sense. Loved it before and enjoying it again. And the fact that nobody are able to make a decent RTS nowadays made this a no brainer deal.","February 21","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This is a fantastic World War II based RTS game, that despite having a healthbar system for tank damage, has some advanced thought that was put into the tank fighting. The ability to capture enemy tanks and artillery is a nice feature. IN addition, it alows for players to play however they want, whether you want to be sneaky, or just spam the living hell out of tanks. Many ways to win, combine with a good soundtrack, simplicity of gameplay to make this one of the best RTS games that I can remember.","February 23","true","18.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The description offered compatibility to Windows 10 64bit. I bought the game, because they wrote it will work under this OS. Long story short the game does not run. I have the intro working fine, then it minimizes to the up-left corner of the screen. I ran it with XP SP3 compatibility, but that only made the mouse move. If you offer something to work under new OS, make it work. I wouldn't have bought it otherwise.","June 2","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
