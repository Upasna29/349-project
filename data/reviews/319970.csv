This story has you follow the lives of two very different characters: Detective Reggie Moore, an older maverick cop with a problem with the politics of law enforcement, and Joe Miller, a crook gone legit trying to hold down a job and a family being forced back into the criminal world. Together they must find out information about a homicide that could just bring the city into chaos.The game opens in a black and white graphic novel panel style for the different scenes; no ambient sounds plays just a fantastic gripping score which adds more depth than you would expect to this gritty drama. After the prologue the player is greeted with a full colour comic style screen, and a neat little page corner appears on the bottom of the screen to indicate the next scene. Having no dialogue audio might be a bit of a turn off for folk, but personally I felt it gave me more involvement in the character development.It also features “the board” a detectives best friend, a cork board with all the characters you encounter with a bio about them and notes on any encounter you have with them.The characters feel slightly “80’s cop movie”, with the maverick detective and your good guy by-the-books partner, resembling a young Danny Glover. The characters have such good friend/partner banter between them that has you enjoying all of the dialogue given to you. I must commend the fantastic story, it gets really heavy-duty at points were you are having to co-operate with criminals to save his victim; You just feel so dirty and angry as you are giving him a deal. This is the sign of a truly gripping story when you actually feel raw emotion towards characters and situations.While the game has no audio when it comes to, well anything really. The only audio in this is the background music, mainly a solo piano playing chilling slow music with off keys and giant bursts of hard hitting dramatic music. All cinematic sounds in the game are represented by old fashion comic noises “thump”, “crack”, “ra-ta-ta-ta-ta” etc. It is a clever way to get across impacts in a far more visually and feeling as someone is elbowed in the face.What makes the gameplay so fantastic is that it feels like an old school adventure game got a slight polish. With the use of Quick Time Events the story is brought into a more modern vibe, which just adds to the immersion as the stress builds during those QTE something fierce. Episode 1 does exactly what it should, grabs you right from the get-go and leaves you desperate for more. It is a truly captivating story, gruesome and pretty heavy-duty, but captivating nonetheless.","January 25, 2015","true","62.7"," 81 of 91 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","81","91","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/319970/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","The Detail is an episodic game about a veteran detective and an ex-criminal trying to solve a murder and investigate other criminal activity. They won’t do this as a team; you’ll control both independently. The developer states that this experience was made for fans of HBO’s hit series The Wire and Telltale Games’ The Walking Dead. Obviously, these weren’t the only inspirations and the game is actually meant to be played by anyone who’s even remotely interested in it, or by anyone who’s interested in adventure games in general. Read on to see what I think of it.\n\nIn the first episode (called Where The Dead Lie) you first control a veteran detective who’s looking into a murder case. During the game you’ll eventually swap with an ex-criminal who’s forced into helping out with the investigations. I’m not going to tell you more about the story; as a story-driven adventure game it’s important that you experience as much of it by yourself.\nDuring this first episode you’ll be clicking on several points of interest. These are all clearly shown with a yellow border around them, so there’s no pixel hunting involved like many, many other adventure games out there. Click on a border and you’ll learn more about it. Looking/reading is your primary action when investigating an object or person and sometimes it’s possible to switch between actions by scrolling the mouse. You’ll be able to easily pick things up and talk to people this way.\nBy playing you’ll also be able to unlock character information of people you meet and even though it’s not necessary to collect them all (or at all, really) I can see people replaying the game just to complete their ‘collection’. It’s not quite similar to The Wolf Among Us’ fairytale creatures, but in a way it is.\nThe puzzles are made with a casual audience in mind, meaning anyone can pick up and play this game without having too much trouble completing it. To be honest I doubt that there are people that won’t be able to finish it at all; in fact, I don’t think you can even call them puzzles. It’s all so subtle that it all feels part of the story, which is good, but if I’m going to play as an investigator I want to be challenged, even if it’s for a little bit. In this case the gameplay is very similar to The Walking Dead, which was basically non-existent. It would be nice to see future episodes have a little more depth, but I also hope they’ll keep the gameplay consistent. Otherwise it might just get messy.\nSo, the gameplay adds nothing new to the genre but still, what is there works as far as the story is concerned.\n\nThe graphics, unfortunately, are a bit of a mixed bag. The black and white comic book-like graphics are done extremely well. In fact, these are just excellent and if the entire game would’ve been made with this style in mind it would’ve been one pretty game. But for some reason (maybe budgetary or artistic reasons) the game uses several art styles, which gives the game an inconsistent look.\nOne of the things that comes to mind here are the portraits (i.e. conversations). These just aren’t very pretty (putting it a bit more mildly here), and overall they kind of distract from the game.\nThe environments and characters (in this case not the portraits) on the other hand get the job done, but the characters could benefit from some extra animations.\nThere’s no voice acting in the game, just text. Of course, there is music; this is very moody and atmospheric, and while it doesn’t make voice acting obsolete, it didn’t make me miss it either.\nI agree with the choice (?)  of not using any kind of voice acting; if you have a small budget you don’t want to ruin the immersion with poor and/or cheap voice acting.\n\nFor a first episode The Detail has an average length. It took me somewhere between 60-90 minutes to finish it. Clearly it isn’t very long but you can replay the game again and make different choices that will affect the story. I suspect the consequences will be even more obvious during some of the later episodes. I thought the length was good. It was long enough to keep me interested in the story and short enough for the gameplay to become too shallow.\n\nThe Detail isn’t quite there yet when it comes to being a classic, but at this stage it’s too early to tell how the story will even unfold. There isn’t much known about the rest of the episodes, except for the fact that the entire game will consist of five of them. There aren’t any release dates so we’ll just have to wait and see. I personally expect an episode to be released every two months, but that’s just me guessing. In any case, The Detail is an interesting game that’s extremely light on the puzzles but it is its story that actually makes me want to keep playing. The first episode ends with a nice cliffhanger and I’m anxious to see and know what will happen next. Now if that isn’t a compliment, I don’t know what is.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","October 28, 2014","true","3.4"," 81 of 94 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","81","94","0","2"

Noire". I completed it in a very relaxed one to two hour game play session. You are essentially choosing your dialogue and, occasionally, your response actions. The screen shots above are indicative of the play area you find yourself in. It DOES have a "hold alt to highlight all things you can interact with", so pixel-hunting is non-existant. (Pressing tab leaves it on permanently).\n\nThere is minimal voice acting and sound effects, but I don't find reading the text to be a chore (and the text is used to enhance the atmosphere) so I appreciate that they have better things to do with their money than do an "OK" VA job .\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure how many of my choices matter in the long run.

So far, the game delivers.\n\nUpdate: It continues it do well in the second episode.","September 27, 2015","true","3.2"," 44 of 45 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","44","45","0","0"

And it all starts with detective Reggie investigating a brutal murder...\n\nGreat graphic novel visual style, decent soundtrack, and intriguing mature story. That's what The Detail has to offer.\n\nIt takes about an hour and a half to finish the first episode, but you can also squeeze about 4 hours out of it if you plan on going for 100% achievements, at least that's how long it took me. I consider it to be priced quite fairly, 6$ for an episode is a reasonable price, however i wish there would have been an option to pre-purchase the entire season, instead of being forced to buy each episode separately.\n\nThe Detail turned out to be exactly what i expected from it, and managed to draw me into it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/commanderllama/recommended/319970/","commanderllama","Lord Captain Commander Llama","http://steamcommunity.com/id/commanderllama/","437 products in account","Although I currently don't recommend buying this game, read on to find out why:\n\nThe Detail is an indie crime-thriller adventure game using a motion comic aesthetic. It's very nice. The story and characters might come off as a little cliche, but the amount of detail that's gone into the police investigation side of things makes the experience fairly immersive. I played through Episode 1 twice in order to see just how much player choice mattered. There are many gameplay similarities to the Telltale adventure games, though choice in Telltale is nearly nonexistent (it's an illusion). It's hard to make that conclusion with The Detail from a single Episode, but choosing much different approaches certainly led to different situations coming up. Not drastically, but the narrative wobbled about in different ways before re-converging to the main plot thread. From a technical stand point, the game ran without issues on my computer.\n\nHaving said all of this mostly positive stuff, why do I not recommend the game? Basically, game length, and bang for buck. There just isn't much here. With my play time above, I was able to do Episode 1 from start to finish twice, and I wasn't even rushing things. The police investigation pickings were detailed, yes, but it had barely gotten started. I still felt like we were in the character introduction stage and the Episode ended. To put a number on it, you can beat Episode 1 in about 40 minutes, which quite a bit shorter than, say, the Telltale games (which are also quite short, but usually on the order of 2 hours).\n\nAs of the writing of this review, there is an Episode 1 and an Episode 2. I KNOW for a fact there's no chance the story can resolve itself, or get particularly deep, with one more episode of the same length as Episode 1. Also, $7 for 40 minutes is a little on the steep end. For my part, I'm going to wait until more episodes are released so I can experience the entire story.\n\nThere's something good here, and the developers have done a good job with what there is, but there needs to be... more. More... Detail.","January 16","false","2.0"," 45 of 61 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","45","61","3","0"

There are multiple profiles to make use of too for saving those extra playthroughs.\n\nIt is quite short, took me just under two hours to complete this once but you do get more playtime out of it by replaying to try out the diferent choices of course. Replays are a must if you want to get all the achievements, as they are tied to the choices you make, so can't all be got in one playthrough.\n\nI really enjoyed this, enough so to go straight back in after my first play to try different choices (and to try to get those achievements I didn't get first time round).

The visual style is, for the most part, nice looking, and it manages to make you feel emotions despite the animated nature of the characters.

That's not their fault, everything has it's demographic. This is quite similar to a choose your own adventure, but with fantastic art and interactivity that makes it much more satisfying. The story is good enough that it sticks with you. Like a decent short novel or something. It's not an action game, or even a puzzle game. It's a story, an experience.\n\nThe first episode has a great climax and ending, and left me wanting more immediately. The ending of the second was quite sudden to me, and I was a little bit disappointed.\n\nThe art in the second isn't as nice in my view. I'm not an artist, but I feel like some of the art used was a draft that ended up as the final piece due to deadlines. There was also some mismatch in the characters depictions in different areas of the game. Character X in a scene sometimes looked different once they were in a conversation and at the forefront of the screen. One officer was wearing a different outfit. I think one persons skin colour changed. Mostly it seemed to be different interpretations of the same character. It's a shame, because the first episode had art that really impressed me, that I could stare at for ages. Staring at the art of the second mainly brought inconsistencies to mind.\n\nThere were also several glitches I experienced with episode 2. My save game wasn't used initially and sometimes the characters in scenes would walk in areas they wern't meant to (like the roof), and I see others had more issues too. The developers have released several updates addressing all the known issues, provided steps to remedy problems, and are generally active in the steam discussions.\n\nOverall I think episode 1 is AMAZING and episode 2 was rushed, but good nonetheless. Realise small dev teams don't have the luxury of being able to extend development time indefinitely. Bills have to be paid.\n\nI absolutely recommend both episodes if my first paragraph describes something you could enjoy (story game, not action game, etc). Reward good developers.\n\nIt's worth nothing that the game is short. My 4 hour playtime was me taking my time, though I havn't replayed with different choices as some people do. I was satisfied with what I got from this and clearly the length of the game is limited by what is feasible with the type of the game (art HEAVY), and the manpower of the developers.\n\nWith context, some leniency for circumstances and such, 8.5/10?\nCompared to a perfect game, 7.5/10?","June 6, 2015","true","4.0"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","2"

Heavily focused on the story and the characters in the game, and not so much on the puzzles, at least in this first episode.\nYou play as a three different characters in a city with increasing crime wave:\nKate - the rookie police officer, Reggie - the old and salty detective and Joe - a man with a family and a criminal past, that's catching up to him.\nThe story is really the strong point of the game. There is no voice acting, and if there was any, this would really look like a well made AAA title. The object of interest are easily visible, plus there is a key you can use to highlight them, with no penalty (or non that I have found out yet), so you should have no problem, figuring out your options. The choices you take, do already change the story in this episode (can't really say more about that without spoilers) and probably in future ones too, and they definitely change the achievements you get - so I would guess, you need at least 3 playthroughs to get them all.\nI find the music and the strong language really fitting well with the story and the whole mood of the game and all that noir comic book style. The character animation may use some love, but then again there is not much movement around, because of the comic book style. Also, I would really like if the game doesn't have to spin up all my hard drives every time before it starts, it's REALLY getting on my nerves.\nThe first episode may look a bit short, but if you check my let's plays - it's as long as the episode 1 of the Wolf Among Us, so I guess it feels short because the story is good ;) Needless to say it ends up with a cliffhanger, so I can't wait for the next one to come out!\n\nTL:DR you can check out my let's play of the game - to get a feel of what's all about :\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=333200382\n","October 28, 2014","true","5.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

It's just frustrating to move the cursor down again to click the next dialog.\nSometimes the cursor doesn't show up, so you have to watch the mouseover effects to guess where it is.\n\nI recommend going for all achievements, because you will redo every main choices and see every possible dialog (although the outcome at the end will be the same)\n\nI will update the review as soon as I played more episodes\n","March 26","true","16.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","12","13","2","0"

Even the conversations are the same, with only superficial changes before you're railroaded into the same dialogue. In fact, your character will usually end up saying the same things, regardless of what you suggest.\n\nMoreover, given that it's a static graphical novel, the writing and grammar aren't actually that good, with grammatical errors such as comma splices and unnecessary apostrophes (e.g. "drive by's") throughout. Honestly, it might be worth playing through once for 0,99€, but only if you like interactive novels. I wouldn't pay anything near the retail price.\n\nEDIT: Grammar.

As a fan of the modern story-driven adventure game revolution (i.e., The Walking Dead, The Blackwell series, and Yesterday), I wound up liking Where the Dead Lie and hope it grows into the game it has the potential to become.\n\nThe first episode focuses around the intertwined stories of a weary detective investigating the suspicious murder of a prominent criminal in the middle of a gangland and that of a reformed criminal just trying to keep his nose clean for his wife and his daughter.  These aren't exactly new archetypes, but they're written well and there's lots of room for the player to play them as good, bad, or somewhere in between.\n\nThroughout the game, the player is presented with several choices for dialogue or action, all of which have repercussions in the ways the people around you react.  My personal favorite was the necessity of playing a cop willing to bend the rules to gain access to a gang member's house.  My boneheaded moves had some real negative effects, ones that left me queasy with the results.\n\nWhile this episode is mostly about laying the groundwork for the plot and characters, these moral choices lead to some excellent taut moments and a brutal showdown at the end of the episode.  If the game's creators can keep up this kind of intense action and dialogue with a pervasive sense of my actions having some real effects, I'll be absolutely delighted.  That said, some way to replay specific scenes when the player has finished with the episode to see the various outcomes without having to replay the whole game would be terrific.\n\nWhen it comes to the moments when you actually have direct control of the characters, the game unfortunately loses some traction.  For example, when the player come to the crime scene of the gangland hit, the playerdo very little actual detective work, and are instead presented with very clear cut-and-dried conversation choices.  There's very little done here to actually make you feel like you're doing detective work.  This initial episode feels a little too guided.  While I'm not looking to solve puzzles or combine inventory items ala the "bad old days" of adventure gaming, some further degree of interaction would have been nice.  I want to feel like I'm doing the detective work, not having the game's characters do the detective work for me.\n\nThe game has a great sense of art style, and the music is terrific.  I'm hugely fond of the environments, which practically made me feel the grit and the grime of this terrifically crafted little universe.  The walking animations felt stiff, something I hope is addressed in future episodes.  Perhaps most head-scratching of all the game's problems is the complete lack of sound effects.  Aside from some rain, there are none.  It creates an odd little disconnect from the game.  Not having speech is fine - it works well with the comic book stylings - but some sound effects would draw me even further into the game's great setup and characters.\n\nAs it stands, while there's definitely room for improvement, The Detail looks to be a phenomenal entry into the growing world of interactive visual novels.  I'm really looking forward to seeing where the plot - and this team of developers - goes from here.","October 28, 2014","true","1.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The characters are beyond cliche (grizzled old cop that wishes things were the way they were before, the former gangbanger that has "gone clean" because he has a wife and a daughter but keeps getting dragged back in to jobs because of a police deal, etc. And are the main two partnered cops one old white guy and one old black guy? You know it!). Aside from all being cliches, the other consistency among all the characters is that they are all unlikable. In this choose-your-own-adventure style of storytelling, the whole point is that you should have SOME control over how the characters interact with others. But more often than not, regardless of your choices, all the characters are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s to everyone they encounter.\n\nFurthermore, the philosophy behind the story is painfully clear: the inner city is full of scum, and we need to give more unquestioned power and funding to cops so that they can go kill all the Bad Guys.\n\nIf that's your (simplistic) opinion, fine. If you want to make an "interactive" game that only serves to reinforce that opinion, fine. But AT LEAST add some new element to your story or characters, instead of rehashing the same old "clean up the streets" story with the same old predictably boring characters.","February 2, 2015","false","1.5"," 39 of 67 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","39","67","3","0"

Playing this game is like reading a graphic novel.  Clicking the edge of the screen is like turning the pages of a book.\nYou get to choose your character's reaction and depending on your reaction, other characters react diferently as well.\nIt is a crime adventure game where you play as a detective.  You also get to play a minor character - an ex-convict that becomes a police asset.  The game tackles a lot of mature topics from child abuse, gang violence, sexual exploitation, family relationships.  That is how deep the game is.\nYou can choose to be a good or a bad cop.  It's your choice.  However, there is no real consequence in the final outcome, whether or not you choose a different path. The end will still be the same.\nIt only affects what Steam Achievement ("SA") you can unlock.\nHere lies the replay value of the game. You get to play out all the different cut scenes based on your choices at the same time unlocking the SA.  Choose one path you unlock one.  Choose the other you unlock another.

The very short gameplay, which is its only weakness, makes you want to play the next episodes of the game even more.

Exceptionally well done and lovely to look at. The game also feels like a graphic novel as it's choice and dialogue focused; there's no inventory in this game. So you have to think about what your character is going to do and how he's going to respond to each person.\n\nI liked the interface: just hover your mouse cursor over something then use right-click to select between the various options to interact with that thing. Quick, easy and efficient.\n\nThere were just enough items in the game to interact with too. Playing as a character in a point-and-click game, I like to get the character's view on an item/their surroundings and Rival Games has managed that here. If it were up to me you'd be able to click on EVERYTHING but then that would take so long that games wouldn't get released.\n\nThe characters were developed well in the two episodes we have so far and I'm curious to see where everything goes next. I hope we get the full 5 episodes the game is teasing us with.\n\nMy only complaint is just that the second episode is very short. I don't tend to worry too much about getting achievements but I suppose replaying and acting differently will extend the length of the game.\n\nA well done, grown-up interactive graphic novel.

The game smartly restricts you from doing too much, which means you don't get frustrated or stuck very often trying to figure out what to do next. The writing tries to ape film noir, and mostly succeeds (it falls into cliche at times).\n\nThe moment when you shift from one POV character to another is a wonderfully unexpected shock.\n\nWorth it for the visuals alone.

This is episode 1 out of 4 or 5, and its total length is about and hour and a half. The story is well written, with an effective atmosphere.

But I just quit the game to get out of the apparently unskippable and incredibly dull credits sequence that you are forced to endure immediately after the incredibly average intro "game" and before you even get to the main story. But from that brief intro I saw terrible writing, and flat and dull story and characters. The only good point is the artwork which is alright but I can't help but feel the art would be a lot better if the artist were given some actually compelling subject matter. The test of any interactive fiction should be, would I be enjoying this story if it wasn't interactive? No, I was really bored. And I love noir, and I love adventure games.\n\nOh and the controls are shocking, I didn't have a mouse cursor in the menu, and I gradually realised the game was expecting me to use a gamepad. I don't have a gamepad, I had a flightstick plugged in. Which didn't work with this game anyway. So I had to disable gamepad in the settings menu just to get mouse control. And even then controls appear to be entirely click to show next panel or choose dialog, with the occasional jarring QTE. And for some reason it keeps resetting the mouse cursor to the center of the screen rather than just leaving it where I expect it to be, i.e. wherever I put it, please just let me use a mouse.","June 1, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Is the best I can do to wipe random flecks of foam from its lips?”\n\nThe Detail is a beautifully executed mature crime drama that offers meaningful choices and multiple playable main characters with different perspectives. It rewards careful thought and good intuition with choices with logical paths. The characters are deep and compelling, which is amplified by the gripping story - all accomplished with brilliant writing.\n\nThe game play is point and click in the vein of Tell Tale's Walking Dead series, and you can tell they took some inspiration in how they balance the pace of the game - there are some really tense moments where you are rewarding by thinking and acting quickly. Considering how much variation there is depending on your choices within the first episode I imagine there will be really great branching in further episodes. The art style is beautiful, some of the art is really beautiful and striking - and some of it seems really amateur, along with the animation, but it all builds the atmosphere amazingly. The music is perfect, it builds the mood without being intrusive. A single playthrough is very short, will take you 1-2 hours, but there is a lot of replayability. If you like crime stories, if you liked the Tell Tale games, or if you just want to support indie devs making amazing games then buy this game!\n\nI can't wait for episode 2!","January 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The main character is Detective Moore, and you follow him as he tries to unveal the mistery surrounding a murder. The setting is gritty and realistic, in a crime-filled city where police forces are scarce and murders and drug deals are unstoppable.\n\nThe script is really well written, giving each character multiple layers of personalities and interesting backgrounds. The game lacks sound effects and voice acting, but the music that plays perfectly fits every situation, be it an intense chase or an investigation.\n\nThe game plays like a modern point-and-click game: there are context-sensitive actions and items are instantly used without being selected. Similarly to Telltale Games' brilliant The Walking Dead, the game has a heavy focus on dialogues, and each choice might change how the story unfolds. During this first episode, there are multiple paths that you can take, and they do have different outcomes.\n\nMost of the game is hand-drawn. That is really impressive, and there is a great attention to detail in the environments that you visit. However, the only animations that you will see is your main character moving, so all the cutscenes are comic strips.\nOverall, this is a promising start to a new crime adventure. The story is engaging, the main characters are well developed and relateable. I highly recommend this game to all adventure games lovers.\n\nStory: 9\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 3\nSound: 7\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 2","October 28, 2014","true","3.1"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

There are only 3 things to click on: The phone, the drunk guy, and the mop. Click on the phone and your character says it's not safe yet. Click on the drunk guy and your character remarks the drunk guy's out cold. Click on the mop, and your character automatically uses it to block the door. You're at the police station trying to figure out where a photograph was developed. There are 4 possible photo labs. You could try thinking about it, or you could just click on all 4 photo labs until your character says "That's it! That's the one!". You can easily beat the game in 1.5 hours. Do a second playthrough to get all the achievements and/or (not to mention the cards you're eligible for, since 1.5 hours is too short to max that out) and you'll realize just how little your choices matter when you do the completely opposite of what you did in the first playthrough, only to yield the same results.\n\nThe game is unpolished. The animations leave a lot to be desired (contrast this with Broken Age, for example). There's a lot of inconsistency on when you're supposed to click to advance to the next frame of the animation and when you're supposed to just wait for the animation to play out. When you type in your name, the vertical bar that marks your cursor is misaligned from where the characters will actually appear. Just a general lack of attention to detail all over the place.","February 7, 2015","false","2.0"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","13","22","0","0"

I really liked the first two episodes--they touched on a lot of interesting and polarizing topics, they had very tight writing, and I felt this was a game where my choices really did or would affect the outcomes. As a choice based narrative game written by a small team that wasn't Telltale Games,I really wanted them to succeed for that reason alone. Unfortunately, the economics didn't work out for Rival Games and they had to make the call that the third episode would be the last. Much like Battlestar Galactica or The Matrix, this is a series that would have simply been better if the last chapter remained unwritten.\n\nEpisode 3 was short, choppy, and utterly lacking in the tight writing and good pacing of the previous two episodes. There were multiple glitchy points where I had to replay multiple times to get the game out of a buggy loop. There was even one partilarly egregious section where I can't even decide if the writing was horrendously poor or the game simply glitched me ahead to a later point. A minor scene ended unfinished and dumped me into a major scene with plot points that seemed new and unsupported by previous events. Rival Games clearly had to cut corners to get this last episode out the door, and major plot threads either vanished or were unceremoniously ended with no foreshadowing. In the end, the third episode really ruined the first two for me.","May 3","false","8.2"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","2"

Probably the closest game i would say for comparison is Wolf Among Us.  Not only because its a detective/murder episodic adventure game.  But the dark themes, art style and music all have a similar vibe.  A main difference though is that instead of voice acting and cutscenes progressing the non adventure portions it is comic book style animation.  Also of somewhat a cool spin is that you play it from multiple characters perspectives.  In this case 3 characters.  2 cops and 1 "civlian". 1 rookie cop and the other the primary detective character.  The choice and consequences in this game are very simlar to Wolf Among Us and other Telltale games.  I really enjoy that requirment of a quick response and unforseen consquences based on your choices. And unlike some games you get to see the fruits of those pan out in this particular episode more or less.  Damn cool especially not knowning how long the wait could be.

I thought I was finished with this type of game, but The Detail offered me much more than The Wolf Among Us or The Walking Dead and it managed this through this first episode.  It does grab you from the get go and leaves you wanting more.\n\nIt's another game where your choices apparently matter and of course the full extent of these choices will not be noticeable until further episodes are released in the future.  However, I played through this episode 3 times and each playthrough was quite different in some clever ways.  In one I was a brutal cop who would beat a suspect and the next time I was pleading with him and offering deals to get information.  It just seemed like it wasn't your standard 'Pick A or B' like many of these games use.\n\nThe lack of voice overs is a minor problem, but it still felt quite atmospheric.  The graphical style is great and certain scenes ooze atmosphere and style.  Some of the game feels like a comic and other parts feel like a classic detective noir movie.  It's a very promising start to the series.\n\nIf you enjoyed the likes of The Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us then you really should try this out.  It's different enough and I think it offers something more.  Each scene is important, it has a good pace and should leave you desperate for the 2nd installment to see what is going to happen.

This review if of the first episode, which was fairly short (comparable to watching a movie). The atmosphere and story are good: decent art and well-suited music. Some of the dialogue was a bit cliched, but otherwise the writing worked. I don't play a lot of adventure games, so it took me awhile to get used to some of the interface elements (right-clicking to switch between examining and talking to an NPC, for example), but once I got used to it it was fun. All in all, I enjoyed it and will likely play the next episode if I can get it on sale of in a bundle.","February 28, 2015","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I especially liked the action sequences where you got to choose what the police officer did under pressure. That was pretty neat.\nBut it's not all good, the faces of the characters are downright ugly in many cases. Walking around the scenes is painfully slow, and extra investigaton of other objects is kind of pointless, I'm not even sure why they were added. It literally makes the game more boring, The dialogue is nothing special, I think the f-bombs were added to try and make it more interesting, but it failed. Miserably.\nThe game was also trying to interweave stories of different people. I guess it was kind of tied together, but I didn't like that. I would have preferred playing as one person the whole game. That's more a complaint of personal preference though, I think, I'm not sure that will bother everyone.\n\nOverall, if you can catch it on sale, it's worth a couple bucks.

In general, I personally prefer games with a strong interactivity and several features and freedom supported by an interesting story instead of softwares with a linear gameplay supported by fair adventures elements.\n\nIn this case I am convinced because The Detail has a great atmosphere and strong visuals with a very interesting protagonist, Reggie a burnt-out cop. Though the quality of the episodes is unstable. Episode 1 is a great start and it makes you want episode 2 instantly. But the beginning of episode 2 is not staisfying and it is the same issue with episode 3. Nevertheless, I think episode 3 is much stronger than the second part (as I saw everybody blamed ep 3 as the weakest part of The Detail) because of its amazing and dark showdown and ending (cliffhanger).\n\nMoreover the 'gameplay' in this game does not really exist. Ok, this kind of genre is not about complex level design, freedom or instant action. But I think if it had called an adventure game it would have been better to expose much more interaction and challange. Instead, The Detail gives few chances to modify the main story and its 'investigation' parts are fur casual players. But even casual gamers will laugh at the primitive 'puzzles' proposed by The Detail.\n\nThough the visuals, the characters, the atmosphere and in total the story are good in this game. Therefore I would recommend this title if you do not really want to play, but read and click for a well-written crime drama.","May 14","true","7.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/recommended/319970/","altered_confusion","Altered_Confusion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/altered_confusion/","289 products in account","The Detail, developed by Rival Games Ltd, puts you into the shoes of a detective who is about to be handed one hell of a case that will change everything in the city. I know this is a slight spoiler, but a gang boss is found executed. Was it a drug deal gone wrong, was it a hired hit, why are all the drugs still at the scene? You will have to answer all of these questions and more. The interesting thing about this game is that it is definitely a point and click adventure, but there are definitely points that can definitely go in different directions. Now of course it still has a concrete start and finish, but this game actually allows you the chance of making different actions take different effects in the end.\n\nGraphically this game looks pretty good, the one thing that does seem a bit off is the walking from front to back, I don't know what it is but it looks off. Now one of my favorite things in a point and click adventure game is the ability to toggle on and off all the interactive spots in an area. The developers do a great job of doing this, with highlighting the areas with an orange circle or arrow, as well as a greyed out circle or arrow for things you have previously interacted with. You will also get to see a wide variety of locations in this game, which to me is especially impressive seeing as the game isn't all that long and doesn't really reuse most of the scenes. I'm also a fan of the character design found in the game, you are going to see people of all different stature, race, gender, and age. Once again quite impressive when you think about the short length of this first chapter of the game.\n\nAlright now comes the ONE portion of the game that left me screaming in frustration. The sounds and music of the game. This is supposed to have intense moments, but none of it felt intense. The music didn't really draw the player in, and the lack of voice work causes me great distress. How could a game that looks this well put together miss out so totally on one of the key components of a game?\n\nThe controls are what you would think for a point and click adventure game. Well almost, you see there is some tension and concentration that is introduced into the game when you are taking part in an action scene. No you don't have to worry about button combos, but you will have to make split second decisions, and in some instances you will have to get the timing just right.\n\nSo here's the deal, the game starts off with decisions in which whatever you choose could bare consequences to the story. The thing is you have to live with them as you go along. Now that being said this definitely allows for a unique chance of actually playing the game again and having slightly different outcomes occur. It is very rare for me, personally, to see an episodic, point and click adventure game, where there's actually replayability, and its not just to do something obscure, you can actually re-write a chunk of the game's middle portion. You are also going to get the chance to play more than just the detective in this game, which will definitely enhance the story that you will find yourself in.\n\nThis game is definitely not meant for all ages, but it is something that I think everyone should at least check out. I just really wish that there was voice acting in this game. The problem is that I know that there are those out there who are going to bee turned off with that amount of reading required to get the whole story. Sure there are parts in cut-scenes, and in situations where you have to make a decision, that perhaps voice acting would not completely fit, but there needs to be something, and in the end you're going to be left wanting. The strange thing is that its a 50/50 split between wanting to hear more than the forgettable background music, and wanting to know what happens next in the game. So in the end I've got to give this game a 7.4 out of 10 (It could have been much higher with better sound).","November 10, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I actually feel burdened by making bad choices in this game and find myself wondering what I could have done differently; maybe this would have played out in a better light. That's pretty impressive work for a small production company. The story is mainly character driven and full of regular detective tropes and cliches, but I'm still hooked! I'm really looking forward to the second chapter.","November 26, 2014","true","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A really good detective mistery which is believable and attention grabbing.\n- Choice making is varied and bold. Gives you a telltale style feedback at the end too. You feel like your decisions mean something.\n- Controls are straight forward and effective in those important cutscenes with controller support too.\n- Good pacing to the pilot episode with 1 and a half hours playing time.\n\nCONS:\n- Lack of vocal narration, theres a lot of reading to be had  and being a detective game you dont want to miss anything. I personally like the comic book style but it didnt have to be completely silent, more noise needed.\n- Movement is a little clunky, a permanant crab like walk is a little silly and sometimes unresponsive when you chose to move to another area meaning you have to move away then back to re-interact.\n\nVERDICT?\nA real gem of a detective game which does lack the polish of a telltale game but has a unique style of story telling. Only the first episode but worth a shot, im certainly looking forward to the next one.","January 25, 2015","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For good reason, I would hide it too if i created this lacklustre production. The detail is an interactive graphic novel with very limited interaction needed. It apparently will have 5 episodes in total, 2 of which have been released and the next three will have a gap inbetween. If that is not enough to put you to sleep, the story in this game should do the trick.\n\nThe developers have chosen to feature several people's timelines in the hope that they will branch together in the end. There is so many timelines and characters, that no character development is spent on one, therefore your care factor on them is zero. If they all were to injest rat poison and end the series quicker you'd probably cheer.\n\nTo make matters worse there is no voice acting, hence you have to read everything to characters you wish would go play with a ceiling fan. The developers have stated that no voice acting is better than cheap voice acting. WHAT A LOAD OF KIBBOSH!!! There are literally hundreds of examples of developers who have voiced their own products and done decent jobs on it. Your a big company aren't you? Surely you have enough money for a microphone? Surely you know how you would like your characters to sound wouldn't you? Stop cutting corners. Give us a GOOD product.\n\nI must admit that they have produced some pleasant eyecatching detailed cartoons especially in the first episode, but all that falls back to a bland, uninspiring example in the second episode. Episode 2 basically just follows the same layed out format as episode 1, hence nothing comes to a surprise. There is even less interaction needed in episode 2 other than to find out where to click next. Very little intellegence needed to get through this graphic novel. In fact i was even able to pass this whole thing by falling asleep and resting my head on the keyboard.\n\nWhile this review is extremely negative, I really wish it wasn't. They have a good idea here, but it's just rather humdrum in it's execution. Hence the money they are asking for is no way on this planet is worth it. There are way better products out there for the same buck. With one third of the people who have bought this complaining that this story is dull and cheesed off that there is no voice acting, i really hope that these Finland developers put a firecracker on their chair, start spicing up episode 3 and go out and splash out on a microphone...","August 27, 2015","false","9.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

I usually enjoy these kind of adventure games, and the story seemed interesting and targeted to a grown up player. But somehow I can´t get around to giving it a thumbs up. I would say it is worth a try and that maybe you´ll like it, but all in all I wouldn´t recommend it.\n\nThe major flaw to me was that this game felt slow. I´m not speaking of troubleshooting, I´m speaking of the pace of the story itself. You have to do most things in a certain order, and if you´re thinking one step ahead you might feel like you´re being held back. The story had potential but its developement and the dialogues didn´t make it worth the being held back feeling. It just felt slow and a bit superficial (like all the coroner´s exchange).\nI didn´t really like any of the characters either, as -in my opinion- they were also rather superficial and stereotyped. The story had potential, but it just followed the path of so many cop-tales before it.\nThe graphs were ok, nothing to write back home about, but adequate to the storyline and the mood. The backgrounds were what I found better accomplished.\nI didn´t really like the soundtrack, it wasn´t noir enough, it wasn´t blue enough, it was somewhere in the middle. Same goes for the choices and the action parts: They were nothing special, the action itself was pretty lame and scarce.\n\nOwning the game I might -might- give it another go to see if different choices make the story look better, or to see how easy it is to get all the Steam achievements. But being this a story one has to buy per episode (and since you can complete each episode in under 2 hours) I don´t think I´ll even check the future episodes.\n\nTo sum up, I didn´t really like it because I found it un-engaging and slow. But would not discourage you from giving it a go if you can find a good price or free demo so you can decide if it´s worth the investment first. I still think The Wolf Among Us was far better in all aspects.","March 17, 2015","false","3.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I get that and I can appreciate it, but it looks terrible here.  Seriously.  The animation just looks hokey.  Some of it looks like at was done by someone who's kinda good at drawing, but not quite there yet.  Story line is really not that great and they don't set it up very well.  Your character is supposed to know something about the murder victim, but you as the player don't actually know, so it's not that interesting.  And what you get from interviews is pretty lame.  I think they had a grandiose vision with the story.  There's a lot going on, but not in a good way.  Too many characters that I just don't think the people who made this can wrangle together into something coherent and gripping.  No truly interesting plot points to really make me care about the next episode.  It's hard to write something compelling when your subject matter is such well-worn territory.  Was hoping for something of the same caliber as The Walking Dead, but this falls way short in my opinion.  This game could've been made twenty years ago.  It looks like somebody's school project.  I finished the whole stupid thing just because I spent money on it.

It's relatively inexpensive, so if all of the cons I outline below don't turn you off, you won't be out THAT much money?\n\nCons: Look, I know the developer is Finnish, and it's possible that something was lost in translation, but the writing in this game is just BAD. Cliche throughout, the one prominent black character is named "Tyrone DeShawn" (really?), and the main detective player character just seems like a real piece of garbage. I'm sort of concerned about everyone that's reviewed this and said that the story and characters are believable. Also, gameplay is nearly nonexistant. Gone Home is more of a game than this, which I don't mean as a dig at Gone Home, I'm just drawing a comparison. "Puzzles" are few and far between, and incredibly simplistic.\n\nI paid three dollars for this game. I'm not going to say it's not worth three dollars, because the production values are decent.

It follows a pretty typical style of writing and character archetypes. This makes it work decently well, yet also doesn't really seem to go anywhere.\n\nI did two playthroughs doing two different playstyles and each one clocked in under 90minutes. In that 90minutes I feel a lot happened, but too fast. After each scene, it seems like the game reset. Your choices matter, in as far as the responses you get feel human and reactive, but only until the next scene and then it's roughly the same as if you didn't make a choice. I felt like my choices were there for achievements and getting different newspaper prints at the end about my choices.\n\nThis is very much an interactive story, don't expect to actually be solving crimes in this or uncovering clues, you just kind of follow the story path and make decisions. Treat it as a dating sim in terms of gameplay (Not a bad thing, just as a comparison) There are a few small timed minigames, but they have short term effects and don't really change the outcome.\n\nOverall the dialogue is entertaining to read and interesting, but it does have its moments where you roll your eyes at the generic lines and sentences from some characters. Namely Joe (Man in orange and blue jacket) who puts me to sleep sometimes.\n\nArt and the visuals are quite varied, can be really nice comic book style, or something I might put on the fridge with a magnet. The game always takes itself seriously (which is perfectly fine), but occasionally some faces make me laugh when they appear.\n\nI know this is just a single episode of 5, and that makes it difficult to make criticisms, but at the same time this is an individually purchasable game in itself. I think it's not enough for the asking price. I don't think it's entirely worth replaying, but it does have some variations as the game moves on.\n\nI recommend it, but not for the launch price of $5.99.","December 8, 2014","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The layouts and compositions are great although on the larger scenes it is not always obvious that you can walk further. The Detail has a great story which I was quickly sucked into. Although the episode only lasts about 2hrs with extensive exploration, the nature of making choices means there is some reply value. After the credits the game shows you facts based on the decisions you made which was a nice feature. It did make me consider my actions in hindsight and I expect it will make me more conscious of them during my second play through.\n\nIf I was to say anything influential it would be to wait until another couple of episodes have been released.

Its a detective game with multiple actors and even more choices for handling pretty much every situation. The game plays kinda like a P&C adventure but doesnt have any puzzle sequences, instead, it allows you to progress the story in a way you choose by offering you multiple choices and then even some more choices after every choice you make and it also uses kind of QTE sequences, which were easy but fun, to replace the lack of puzzles.\n\nHowever, this game is, in my honest oppinion, waaaay too expensive for the approximately 100 minute long game and note that this is only part 1 out of 5 or 6 parts that are planned to be released for this title, probably with the same length price tag as the first one.\n\nSo, if the price is ok with you, get it, its a fun experience that you can enjoy if you are into this kind of games but if you feel like its expensive like i do but still wanna play some detective and crime themed adventure game, get the original Still Life for the same price but incomparably longer content.","September 17, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sorry!\n\nThis is essentially an interactive graphic novel. As a designer I was attracted by the art style which does not disappoint. The layouts and compositions are great although on the larger scenes it is not always obvious that you can walk further. The Detail has a great story which I was quickly sucked into. Although the episode only lasts about 2hrs with extensive exploration, the nature of making choices means there is some reply value. After the credits the game shows you facts based on the decisions you made which was a nice feature. It did make me consider my actions in hindsight and I expect it will make me more conscious of them during my second play through.\n\nIf I was to say anything influential it would be to wait until another couple of episodes have been released. It is a very loss end otherwise. If you do want to play episode one try to go for a bundle as I think I paid about $3 for Episode One + 5 other games.\n","May 12, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no turning back due to the comic book style narrative.\n- This also means there is no room for endless backtracking talking to NPCs over and over and no fidgetting with inventory items wondering what to do next. Thats a good thing though. The endless backtracking and fidgetting really only works in comedy point and click games with humorous exchanges rather than in serious toned games where you just become frustrated if you can't progress\n- I did find that the game only let the player do the raw policework but did not let the player "solve" any of the clues or policework. The characters often solved it for you or automatically explained what a clue meant etc.\n- The biggest downside is that so much is put into the narrative that it works almost too well. Episode 1 really does feel like a pilot episode of a really engaging crime noir series.
