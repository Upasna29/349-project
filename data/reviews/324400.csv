While the artwork and visual design of the Desert Ashes world is actually really nice, it is unfortunate that the developers did not spend as much time on fleshing out the story and world in the way that Advance Wars does.  If they added CO's with personalities and names and some investment in character writing, it would go a long way to making a connect with the game universe.\n\nDespite all the bugs, the lack of depth and refinement, the lack of story and universe, I'm still going to recommend the game on the strength of its visual assets and core gameplay -- which, though not as in-depth or interesting as Advance Wars, is still a fairly enjoyable casual turn-based strategy game that newcomers to the genre will probably find fun and addictive.  Just don't expect it to measure up to the source material it is trying to emulate.","November 6, 2015","true","1.9"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","22","22","0","0"

If it would be just the normal Player vs AI nobody complains. But this AI has several advantages. Like distance measurements that it can attack you, but you cannot attack back. Or lucky strikes or insanely high money rates. I tested in Smirkish mode the other side and could barely defeat that AI. On multiplayer you desperately suffer of lack of opponents and get lost in those thousands of menues. The game has hidden functions like cloning game sessions or online automatching. Otherwise scrolling through my whole friendlist to battle a friend is a desaster. I even got connection problems and the upranking progress was flipping on each 2nd game from minus to plus. The graphics seem pretty unique, but that gameplay freaked me out.","February 13","false","4.5"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/recommended/324400/","Loganesquire","*Logan*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/","59 products in account","Pocket God vs Desert Ashes is the "sequel" to Desert Ashes, also available on Steam.\nThese games are turn-based strategy, which play very similar to Advance Wars. You purchase different units for various amounts of gold from your captured factories and bases on the map, and move them into position to defeat the opposing team.\nI feel that this game should of been sold as DLC for Desert Ashes, because so far I find there to be a lot less content and story here than Desert Ashes to warrant a stand alone game and price.\nThis game adds a new team to fight as called the Pocket Gods (Ooga Chaka), and you play as them in the campaign. In a very unusual move, the "water freezing map event" that occurred at 1 am game time in Desert Ashes was removed in this game. This was a rather useful event in Desert Ashes because you could travel on the frozen ice as if it were land for a couple game time hours, but now that it's gone, the game continues to tell you what time it is game time for no reason at all now.\nAfter 7 hours I have seen far less story scenes between campaign missions, and a much more simple tutorial. I have also found a rather unusual bug that happens occasionally, where I can not scroll down to the bottom of the unit creation screen to make a "Dodo" unit, and a large yellow Y appears on the screen when I try.\nThis strange bug was NOT in Desert Ashes.\nThis game basically just assumes you are familiar with Desert Ashes, which is fine, but this is another one of the reasons I feel it should of been sold as DLC instead of a separate game.\nAnother issue is the lack of online players.\nWhile it is nice to have the option to both host and search for online games at the same time (you can easily play multiple games at once both online and offline with the unique menu system) the lack of players is very obvious. You will find no one else playing for very long periods of time. This is ANOTHER reason why this game should of been sold as DLC, they have split the online community for this game further by forcing two versions of what is basically the same game.\nAs I mentioned in my review for Desert Ashes, I really like these HD colours, and unique artwork and menu system, but the game does feel somewhat unpolished and incomplete just like the previous game. I have finished campaign (15 hours) but it didn't feel like I was doing much other than the same generic maps over and over. It was a good length though if you play it through to the end, and a very rewarding final battle.\nComplaints aside... I DO recommend you buy this if you like games such as Advance Wars, or your a fan of turn based strategy games in general.\nThe gameplay of this series IS really fun.\nI picked this game up during the Holiday Sale 2015 for .54 cents CDN so I feel it was money well spent, but be aware of what your buying if paying full price.","January 1","true","13.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Although this review says positive, this game is not like the Pocket God Mobile App. This game is purely using pygmies to fight other people.

The Gameplay is just a traditional turn base strategy game, and that's fine, but all the rest, the annoying sounds, the awful characters. This looks like a bad mobile game that got turn into a bad pc game. And is sad because you can tell that there is a lot of work here, but it simply didn't pay off, like at all.","February 2","false","0.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

Bottom line: not worth $5. If it were $2.50 or so, like most mobile games like this, I'd say buy it. It lacks depth.\n\nPros:\nFun, challenging AI\nGraphics and art direction is interesting\nGame demands a mix of units to succeed, rather than just finding the strongest unit and building like mad\n\nCons:\nCampaign is not difficult enough\nSkirmishes mirror campaign missions\nMain character in story says, "WAAAAAAAAH" way the ♥♥♥♥ too often\nOnline play is not working at this time\nLow replay value\n\nDisclaimer: I got this for free in a recent giveaway, so I didn't lose anything by trying it. Honestly, this belongs as an Android or iOS app for a tablet, not a full PC release. It could be browser-based, it's so basic.","March 5","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
