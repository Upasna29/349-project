Baconbite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mylakovich/","301 products in account","Cute graphics, relaxing atmosphere. Nice polish on the interface.\nThe gameplay is simple, click on a shape to shift it a direction or remove it.\nSome of the shapes have a countdown timer, you have to keep removing those or else.\nHowever because you don't have perfect control over the direction, you have to plan.\nSometimes it seems impossible, but more than once I realized some way to clear the skulls right on time. Those little moments feel satisfying.\nHowever just as often you feel screwed that you randomly didn't get the right shapes and have no chance of clearing them in time. You could play perfectly and still lose, that kind of sucks.\nThere some hint at a story of a wierd glitchy AI trying to escape, it makes you want to keep playing.\n\nOverall it's exactly what you would expect, a shiney puzzle game.\nI bit the bullet for $7, and I'm not quite sure it's worth that much. If you love puzzle games then go for it, otherwise wait for a sale.","December 19, 2015","true","5.1"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

Works really well with touchscreen.\nThe only downside is you end up relying on luck in the hardmode levels.\nThere's also a small story hint which is nice, but rather pointless.","December 26, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwishdog/recommended/410150/","iwishdog","foxxu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwishdog/","78 products in account","A simple relaxing puzzle game. The design of it is easy on the eyes and there isn't a confusion on what to do. There is a tutorial, but what more can you say about a puzzle that is just matching. It is quite fun and challenging. I want to say it is easy because I got high scores a lot on the global matches, but who knooows.\n\nI just want all the achievements.\n\nIf you want a relaxing puzzle game that throws you skulls and weird eye shapes then it's a game for you ; u ; I really like it, but its more of a one time game and you should get it for free or really cheap.\n\nTip: Even though the skulls are annoying and can become a hassle to the challenge itself; focus on the challenge and just keep a watchful eye on the countdowns... because if you are just trying to beat the countdown you will be setting yourself up for a failure.","April 25","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
