No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved.\n\nPlease note that anti-cheat tools are a necessity in multiplayer games to protect you, our community, and please be assured that your privacy is important to us too.\n\nRegards,\n[NX]Dualism\n\n- According to this Nexon Developer Dualism, " No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved." So what is the point of having Xigncode3 on our computers that are " hashing scanned strings and comparing them to those of known malicious programs"? All information online is being sent, received, saved, and transcribed. If you have the balls to claim that "No actual information about your system is ever sent or saved" then you shouldn't be a developer at all because you have ZERO  knowledge of how data works online.\n\nIf Xigncod3 does not send or store information, how is it that another Nexon Developer is able to tell a user (on the forums) [**it is or will be deleted by Nexon when you read this review**]  that they were visting a malicious website regarding hacks, cheats, etc (I don't know what the user was on). Information was sent somewhere so that the developer could read the log or history and determine the user was on a malicious website. In order to have a log or history... something was saved. Ex. How do we know what happened in the past if it wasn't written down? That was your first contradiction Dualism.\n\nXigncode does not store information about my system huh? How do you explain that the program keeps track of everything on the users computer and what was modify within the last 48 hours? Is it necessary for Nexon or the company that codes Xigncode to know what print driver I have installed or that I created a meme on Microsoft Paint? I mean that meme is a new/edited file. Do you really want to see it that bad before i post it on Imgur or 9gag?  Second contradiction Dualism.\n\nAlso, just because the information being sent by Xigncode may be (BIG MAY BE)  encrypted doesn't mean a hacker  (reverse engineer) can't decode the encryption and possibly steal user connection info such as ip address, internet company they use and possibly more. Big companies like Walmart, JPMorgan Chase and Target got hacked for their customer credit cards. Here is a full list of companies that were hacked in 2014\nhttp://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2014/10/cyber-attacks-on-us-companies-in-2014\n\nHow is one to trust a gaming company so small that it can compare itself to Valve and Blizzard which have superior net worth and income levels to protect users if their data was ever breached?Thats your third contradiction Dualism. Xigncode may perform similar functions as Valve (Vac) and Blizzard (Warden) but it doesn't guarantee user protection.  Also if Counter-strike Nexon Zombies is on Steampowered which is owned by Valve why not adopt the VAC system? Nexon Zombies is basically a big mod of Counter-Strike 1.6 so shouldn't it adopt the same anti-cheat system?\n\nThe fact that Nexon changes their EULA on the whim without letting their users know is questionable. Blizzard, Valve, Ubisoft all send out notices that EULA has been updated/changed and asks the user to accept it. Most don't read it but we at least know it was updated/changed.\n\nDualism, Do you care to update or change your response?\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Updated* (11/18/15) - Nexon is currently using XIGNCODE for their hack sensor. XIGNCODE scans all the files within your computer that was opened in the last 48 hours as well as the websites you've visited within those hours.. This is a huge breach of your rights, and privacy and a potential data .mine for hackers..\n\n\n\nGame use to be good.... Now it just sucks. Most servers are filled with lag and people teleporting thru the map. Every update/patch seems to make the servers worse. Game has been more about money grabbing by Nexon then building a gaming community that appreciates the game thus more likely to actually spend. Majority of the players are EU>SA>NA but SA players are unsupported with a server. They piggyback on NA servers causing all types of lag and server glitches due to their connection. If you're in NA servers expect your ping to bounce from <100 to about 200-300+. Not many hackers which is a +1 but a ton of people abuse bugs and tons who use VPN even tho is banned by Nexon. +1 for staff since they actually read forum posts.","October 9, 2015","false","372.1"," 759 of 832 people (91%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","91","759","832","43","40"

I have made my experience with the official Nexon company and their games and if you are looking for a game with a fair gameplay then you are wrong here.\n\nThe main company is located in South Korea and they focus on "microtransactions" ingame. In my opinion this company is criminal and if you listen to me, you should stay away from Nexon games because you will soon or later be ****** by them. Not to mention the poor customer support and development teams of them...\n\nAt first the games may seem to be nice: a familiar or interesting name, some gameplay elements that people are used to, a nice community and they promise not to add any game-changing objects into their "Cash Shop".\nOnly cosmetics they said, but then it's patch day: "The new item is out and it's at least twice as good as the old one!" That's what they will write.\nHowever, the good items are either impossible to get or so incredibly hard to get, that you will have to purchase something in their "Cash Shop“ to actually have a chance to get it or you will have to pay massive amounts of cash to get it. But let's be honest, at the end you will have to pay anyway if you don't want to be a "loser"...\nTheir games are being designed to be endlessly looping, they can be very addictive and they are trying to make you pay for almost everything. The developers are adding as many annoying paywalls into their games as possible.  And of course you can bypass these for a while by paying their ridiculous prices. May it be silly expiration dates of items which can be extended for a specific amount of time, more experience points, better drop rates, more ammo, health and whatsoever. They are professional psychologists, trained to empty your pocket. They know that some people would pay anything to "compete" and "win" against others.\nOver time there are going to be updates which will contain even more and better items until the complete game is messed up. Maybe they will even have the brilliant idea to "upgrade" the aviable items and increase the HP of the enemys and players to "balance“ the game in a so called "revamp“, but then it only takes some time until it's messed up again. Month by month there are going to be better items, which are supposed to "replace“ the old ones. This way they are forcing the players to spend even more money if they want to stay at the "top“. Anyway, I'm just getting to the end here...\n\nThere are good and there are bad "Free to Play"  titles. Nexon's games are definitely bad. The more money people spend at these games, the more "updates“ they are going to get and the more of them are going to be released. And they have ruined so many other games already (Maplestory, Combat Arms, Atlantica, Dekaron, War Rock, etc.).\n\n*Edited this review so it has a different shape...","October 7, 2014","false","0.5"," 3,109 of 3,571 people (87%) found this review helpful 87 people found this review funny","87","109","3","87","111"

You liked the Zombie Mod for it, too? Great! We'll just tack on our p2w attitude, a bit of censorship, and terribly translated lines! We'll even stick our name on the title so you know who to ha-- I mean love!\nMe: WTF is this garbage? -420/50\n\n*** EDIT ***\n\nI am well aware I have over 150 hours on record (blame other games being on patch day).\nMy stance on the game has still not changed, but I'm in a much calmer place, at the time being, so I'll try giving it a less... ragey... review.\n\n-MINUSES-\n-The game is still very much p2w, as the best guns in the game are invariably purchasable for real money, or obtainable through the Death Star Torpedo shot that is the Decoder.\n\n-The censorship is still there, and is just as noticable to those that can understand what they're saying, which I will get to later. The chat is annoyingly filled with astrixes, even for stupid phrases that only an over-protective mum or Chinese game would want or need.\n\n-You still can't have a PROPER server, nor go to ANY server that isn't (in the scheme of things) run by Nexon. Seriously, I challenge you to find a PLAYER OR COMMUNITY HOSTED server. This has led to it being as though you were playing with bots, even with a full room.\n\n-You cannot change your name without forking over a few bucks, you know, as if this were some sort of MMO. This also applies to clan tags (or tites, as they've been turned into).\n\n-You will find the same exact 3-5 maps being repeated over, and over, and over.\n\n-There's no way to filter languarges. This is especially problematic if you don't fluently speak Spanish in the American regional servers.\n\n-Different player models have different stats, AGAIN giving an advantage to those wiling to fork money over (or who win the lottery-level luck of the Decoder).\n\n-The twice-afore-mentioned Decoder CONSTANTLY plays the 'so-and-so player you have probobly no damned clue who is has just won <INSERT OVERPOWERED WEAPON / PLAYER MODEL HERE> message, which constantly interrupts the few times when someone manages to /actually/ start up a dialogue.\n\n+PLUSSES+\n\n+It's good to fill in the nostalgia, for a few hours.\n\n+It provides the oppertunity to therapeutically punch zombies.\n\n+It's a good time waster, when everything else you play is patching.\n\n=That... really is all I can think about. Sorry guys. In the end, I wouldn't recommend this game, and I'm sorry about the saltiness in the O.P.","October 7, 2014","false","162.1"," 1,892 of 2,180 people (87%) found this review helpful 429 people found this review funny","87","892","2","429","86"

All the mods that the community worked so hard to make is what players were turning to instead of playing 5v5 dust2 matches all day.\n\nIn this game though (CS:NZ) if you want new content you have to pay. So no, your " You don't have to buy the DLC/Microtransactions, it's optional" arguement is not valid. I never paid for any CS 1.6 mod, that's why me and a lot of others got thousands of hours on it.\n\nEdit : Someone told me that I only played 0.2 hours so the review isn't accurate. Well, as soon as I launched the game I was drowned in microtransactions and advertisements. Taking a quick look at what those items do I realized that they aren't only cosmetics so there you go, hope you find this one useful.","October 11, 2015","false","0.2"," 198 of 257 people (77%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","77","198","257","23","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hunnybunbun/recommended/273110/","hunnybunbun","Suzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hunnybunbun/","107 products in account","Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is dissapointing.\n\nPROS:\n- Updated Graphics\n- More guns\n- Survival Mode\n\nCONS:\n- Unbalanced Zombie mode\n- Pay 2 win\n- Time consuming\n\nOVERVIEW:\nCSN: Zombies just doesn't live up. I can't tell if this game is trying to be a Call of Duty rip-off or not. Dead serious. In CSNZ, you can partake in multiple gamemodes that you feel you want to play. There's Original, which is basic CS 1.6. There's different kinds of Zombie modes, but I only played one. I had a huge problem with this Zombie mode. It is WAY too unbalanced. A CT has 100 HP, and can be turned into a Zombie in 1 hit. A Zombie has 2000 HP (with the exception of the 7000 HP host zombie) and can take a LONG time to kill. This game is a grindfest. I only won 2 rounds as Humans due to hiding. The last mode I want to talk about is Survival. This game should have never been called Zombies. It should've been about this Survival mode, because it is the best thing in this game and the only reason i'd go back to play (besides playing with new guns in Original mode). In Survival mode, it's purely you and your teammates and whatever cash you can scavenge. Waves of different kinds of HUMAN enemies will try to kill you. Regular gunmen, big ♥♥♥ armored soldiers with miniguns, Survival has it all, including a Boss battle at the end of each one. As you kill more and more soldiers you can buy bigger and better guns and equipment. Survival missions technically have a story line, but you will be more inveloped in the gameplay than someone who only gives lines during the middles of waves. It can become really chaotic and what balances this factor out is a super quick regeneration system. It's just like CoD. Hide back and wait, but it only takes a couple of seconds. Normally, this kind of thing doesn't go good in my book. I've always thought regenerating health as a character was kind of a cheat. The way I prefer it is how it works as a pickup in Quake. But it works with Survival mode. It fits right in and makes the mode so much more fun.\n\nNow that i'm done with the gamemodes. Let's move on to the rest of the game. There is a shop to buy things with your points you've collceted for either playing for an extended amount of time or for completing a mission or match. Now this isn't a problem. You may want to buy new guns with these points. Oh wait. YOU CAN't. THERE ARE NO SINGLE GUNS LISTED IN THE SHOP. ONLY THING AVAILABLE IS WEAPON PACKAGES THAT COST REAL USD. I can't overexagerate how stupid companies are when they place a pay 2 win system in their games. And these guns can be seriously overpowered in some matches. It really shows that games like these don't care about your experience, but your money.\n\nLet me explain my overall gameplay feeling. I can't enjoy Zombie mode, so i'm gonna skip that. Original mode is actually not all that bad. At first I was confused, but it was a quick adjustment. I think Original mode allows for players to pick up new guns they bought and try to test them against other players, to see if it was really worth the purchase. You can play on all the old CS 1.6 maps, including dust2 and italy, And with the game's updated player graphics, it actually feels really nice. Survival mode is amazingly fun and the only reason you should actually sit down and play this game.\n\nI don't recommend this game. Only because of it's poor Zombies mode, which is how the game was advertised, and because of the Pay2Win system. If this game got rid of some things, it'd be a fun addition to the CS series, but I can't find all my fun in it. Yes, Survival is great and all, but that doesn't mean i'm gonna sit there 24/7 gunning down massive waves of enemies. Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies tries it's best to fit in with the rest of the franchise, but some factors just kick it to the curb.\n\n*UPDATE* (As of 10/26/14)\nI've read peoples messages, comments, etc. And all I keep finding is the complaint of needing to play for more than an hour before writing a review. First off, I played a good 50 minutes. Sorry if I was 10 away from the 1 hour mark. Second, I don't remember the point where playtime resulted in a fun game. If there are so many reviews on this game, with low playtime, wouldn't that hint you that it wasn't an overall enjoyable experience, causing us to put down the game?\n\nI'm still sticking with all my points. I really don't see any reason to change what I feel about them. The game dissapointed me, so I only sat through 50 minutes of it. I have more fun playing L4D2 than this.","October 20, 2014","false","0.8"," 222 of 311 people (71%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","71","222","311","14","11"

Do know before you begin reading this review that this is a very HONEST review. Even though some aspects of this game aren't the most ideal and great i do still enjoy this game till today. Please feel free to edit me if any way if i misunderstood some aspects of this game, I am always open to new ideas. Sorry for the essay guys xD!\n\nPositive:\n- Large variety of guns to select from.\n- Alot of different modes and maps to choose and play from.\n- Family and groups to hang out with.\n- Old counter strike maps to play on.\n- Have both PvP And PvE.\n- A nice story line.\n- A nice community who are willing to help out.\n- Most of the computers can run this game smoothly.\n\nNegative:\n- Requires a lot of grinding.\n- Alot of campers in this game.\n- Very loud and unbalanced sound.\n- Very unbalanced weapons.\n- Really bad graphics.\n- Game layout may be difficult for new players to navigate.\n- Many of the weapons and items you get in the game are durable.\n- There isn't alot of english players in this game.\n- Events are quite repetitive in this game\n- There are bugs in some of the maps and modes.\n\nNow lets get to the hot topic of this game.\n\nIs this game a free to play game?\n\nBefore i answer this question i just want you guys to know that this game is heavily based on luck and the following answer is based on players who are just normal players with normal luck going into the game.\n\nThis game is a free to play game if you don't mind having a bunch of durable weapons and items. Being killed by other players with better weapons. Being killed by zombies in the zombie hero mode or zombie scenario. However you can still enjoy the different modes and maps without paying a single penny! This is what you will experience if you are willing to invest in at around 15 hours into this game.\n\nThis however can be changed but it requires a large amount of grinding and a few hundred hours invested into the game. Now lemme explain the systems in this game and how it works.\n\nThis game like i said before offers a lot of durable weapons and items. However if you do want permeant weapons and don't want to pay a single penny it is still very possible. This method will require you to invest at least a few hundred hours if you are a player who has a average luck like i do. Now the ways you can earn permeant weapons are through events (Do know that many events don't offer permeant weapons), crafting, extension coupons, mileage decoders and by bingo boards. Now lemme go through briefly each of these systems.\n\nEvents:\nEvents in this game sometimes offer decoders and supreme decoders (Most are really few to nothing) and gives out weapons at times depending on the month. Some of the weapons given like the christmas weapons have a duration. Other events like the spell the weapon name event gives permeant weapons however doesn't have much of a difference compared to the default weapons.\n\nThe crafting system:\nThis system is mostly used when you complete daily missions, grind zombie kills and decomposing your weapons (Most popular one) Now to actually have a chance of even getting a permeant weapon you need to sythensize and combine your durables to 72 days - permeant. Do know that this process can fail and result you with nothing left. Now if you were lucky enough to go through that you also have to do the same with the blueprints. After all that is done you still aren't offered a 100% chance at getting a permeant craft you still have the chance to fail. From my hours and i may just have been a really unlucky guy after a few hundred hours into the game i have only crafted one permeant weapon. This is just one way to earn a permeant weapon.\n\nExtension coupons:\nNow to earn extension coupons you can either get this from decoders or by disasembling weapons. When you disasemble weapons and if you are doing this right with a large amount of weapons you have the chance of earning a few extension coupons. When you open decoders you have the chance to win around 20 extension coupons ++ and the max you can earn i believe is around 500. With that you need to save up to 999 extension coupons with that you can then make one permeant weapon.\n\nMileage decoders:\nMileage decoders are like buying lottery or opening lottery the chances of earning permeant weapons can be scarce at times and won't get you much. If you are lucky you can get some permeant weapon at your first opening. However if you are unlucky you can open a hundred decoders and not get a single permeant weapon.\n\nBingo board:\nIn the bingo board you can pick up some really good permeant weapons. However to be able to use the bingo board you will need to open decoders which will grant you 30 to around 50 mileage points. Now you are only able to earn 3 mileage decoders a day which requires you to play a total of 3 hours. With these mileage points you can choose to reset your board to get good permeant weapons which requires 50 mileage points and changing the grand prize for 350. Now as you advance in the bingo board your opening special numbers will increase and so will opening random numbers making you need to grind and farm more for permeant weapons. In general if you are a free to play player it will require a large amount of game time and investment.\n\nWeapon upgrade event:\nWhen the weapon upgrade event comes around you can upgrade non permeant weapons into permeant weapons but with a even stronger form then its previous. This event usually brings 4 weapons that can be upgraded into the game. All you have to do is just open a few mileage decoders or craft the weapon which is quite easy if you save up alot of mileage decoders or blue prints and is another way to earn powerful and permeant weapons.\n\nIf you can endure everything i have just mentioned above, install and play away it is indeed a free to play game if done right. I just want to say that i do enjoy this game and i really like it and would recommend it to my friend. However i just wanted to do a honest in depth review of the game. I still love this game though! It is still part of my favorites! Anyway thanks for reading!","May 2","true","313.5"," 73 of 86 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","73","86","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobinVtheDrusky/recommended/273110/","RobinVtheDrusky","RobinV","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RobinVtheDrusky/","184 products in account","In its current state, Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nServers:\nI'm not sure if this is the case for NA players or those outside Europe in general, but playing this game off a stable internet connection in the European servers was not enjoyable whatsoever. Every few seconds (it varied, really) the server would freeze up briefly, leaving me to struggle to do anything and rendering the game virtually unplayable.\n\nOptions, UI and general game stability:\nLet's start with options first... And we're done. Honestly; all I could see in the Video section of the Options was the ability to change the resolution, screen display mode (which consisted of 'widescreen' and 'regular' - I've no idea what 'regular' is supposed to mean) and the mandatory brightness/gamma. No advanced options whatsoever.\n\nUnder the audio section you have your usual sliders for SFX Volume and Music (Music I'd recommed you turn right down, as not only is it ear-rapey on first start up, it completely overlaps ingame SFX too), Sound Quality settings (High and Low - no medium?) And a few tickboxes for enabling EAX Hardware Support and A3D Hardware Support (I've no idea what these are either).\n\nAs for Mouse and Keyboard, it's your generic Source Engine options set up, with a depressing lack of 'Raw Input' tickboxes. I suppose it makes up for this with the 'Mouse Filter' tickbox, but it's just not the same.. :( Also, it features rebindable keys for all modes in the game, which was nice to see, abeit it being mandatory anyway. The option to invert the mouse it also included.\n\nThe 'Multiplayer' section is the most confusing and deceiving section of this Options menu. Reason being that it appears all nice and fine with it's ability to change crosshair (looks, colour, size and whether you want it translucent or not) and spray settings (yeah, custom sprays!) But then throws in a curveball with it's 'Advanced' section. Put simply, it seems like the Developers had no idea where to put spare options and dumped them in there. In this 'Advanced' section you'll see settings for map objects (like the amount of dropped magazines and bodies on the floor), smoke effect quality and volume, as well as UI settings. There is also a bunch of tickboxes for the radar, as well as ones for ingame options (like the UI)\n\nSpeaking of which, the UI is awful. Okay, well maybe not THAT awful, but it's still pretty bad. The buy menus are relatively confusing for first-time Counter Strike players and the UI for your weapons and ammo etc are placed in peculiar locations that require the user to look in certain places to see what they've picked up (thus distracting them from that AWP-er lining their sights up on them). This said, there is an option to set the UI to 'classic' which I assume is supposed to be like CS: Source or 1.6, but I personally didn't notice a difference.\n\nIn terms of stability, the game hold up pretty well. The only times I crashed was when trying to close the game, which didn't matter that much. Though I'd like to mention that changing the resolution will force the game into fullscreen unless you tick the box that enables windowed. About the resolution changes too, I had to reboot the game a couple times to actually see the option for 1920x1080, only to realise that it only changes to that resolution when you're in a match, then to default back to windowed when navigating the main menu (why it does that, I don't know). This game is also awfully hard to ALT+TAB out of while in fullscreen, it'll likely take a good couple seconds (maybe more) to minimise, oddly.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is fairly standard; shoot Terrorists as Counter Terrorists, plant bomb as Terrorists - usual CS basics right there, so I won't be covering the 'Original' game mode (which only consists of 1 map - Dust II). What this game does bring that is completely unique to CS are the 'Zombies' modes.\n\nThe first, and main, mode (called 'Zombie Scenario') is 'meh', to be honest. It'll usually consist of you buying an M249, walking forward, and holding down right mouse, while occasionally interacting with the objects in the environment to further the mission. This game mode also brings it's own 'story' (for lack of better term) in which you play a set amount of these missions in a linear order. I assume the missions vary in type, but I sadly didn't get far enough through the first one without boring myself to death to experience the others.\n\nThe second, lesser important, mode (called 'Zombie Hero') is essentially stock Counter Strike but with the Terrorists playing as the zombies. Sounds cool, huh? Well it is until you realise that, when playing as 'Terrorists', you'll mainly be hiding around corners or chasing the Counter Terrorists in the hopes of getting a kill before you're inevitable demise and wait period until the next round begins.\n\nThankfully, the guns in this game do handle like the ones CS Veterans will be familiar with, sticking true to the CS concepts and basics.\n\nMiscellaneous:\nBeing a free game, there's most likely going to be strings attached, right? Well yes, that's correct, and Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies comes up far from short on that front. Upon opening the game you'll be barraged with rewards of items that are used in an extremely complicated crafting system (I'll talk about this later) as well as friendly info that there's a shop. In this shop you can spend points that I assume you can earn ingame (this isn't specified) and through paying real money. These points are used for buying items that you're only allowed to use for a set period of time before having to rebuy (you have the option to buy it for 10 days or pay extra for 30 days). You can also spend real money on different player models, weapon packages and xp boosts.\n\nCrafting:\nMentioned previously, the crafting system is pretty confusing at first, but easy to get the hang of. It works like unboxing, you put in the 'Blueprints' that contain a set amount of items (they're dropped depending on your play time, and come in numbered tiers - the higher number the better), put in the 'Durable' part (this'll decide how long you get to use your crafted item for) and voila! You get the chance to craft some god-tier item or something really rather useless. On a sidenote, the crafting can actually fail, meaning you lose your Blueprint and Part (seriously man, just like unboxing...)\n\nTo conclude this lengthy review (and give those too lazy a brief TL;DR), I wouldn't recommend Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies until the Developers can add incentives to make waiting for the download to finish worth it. Though, if you have the internet to download it quickly, go ahead and give it a try. Who knows? You might find enjoyment out of it.\n\nThanks for reading, and have fun!","October 9, 2014","false","1.4"," 137 of 201 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","137","201","2","4"

While I would say if you didn't have 1.6 this could be an alternative given the team deathmatch mode, there are changes in movement and physics that really mess it up. It should have been made in the CS:GO engine for improved graphics and other things (you don't need much to run CS:GO anyway) and I don't think it should really be a standalone game. It is just a mod.\n\nI played Zombie Escape which involved me following arrows on a map which looked open - but turned out to be very linear, just the same thing every round. It was an ok concept for a game/gamemode, but it lacked any enjoyment for me - and I sometimes found myself stuck in the walls of the map, just waiting for my demise. Then it happened as a zombie, and I couldn't do anything - so I quit the server.\n\nSo this review doesn't go on forever, here are my pros and cons about the game:\n\nPROS:\n\n-The game is free so you don't waste any money trying it out (unless you use the microtransactions...)\n-Some good concepts for gamemodes which could be improved and expanded upon more\n\nCONS:\n\n-Some people don't like free to play - so I'm putting that here too.\n-Microtransactons\n-COD-Style Levelling\n-Bugs (Stuck in walls, game not starting correctly to name a few)\n-Made in the 1.6 engine rather than using something more up-to-date\n-Linear arrow following in what could have easily been a more expansive world to play in\n-Movement changes from 1.6 make it somewhat unfamiliar to 1.6 players\n-Gets repetitve quickly\n-It could easily have just been a mod, and some of the gamemodes are probably playable in Gmod\n- YOU DON'T MOVE FASTER WITH YOUR KNIFE OUT\n\nOverall I would say this game is a 4/10 as it's features are rather lackluster. I feel as though Nexon have let us down, as I was somewhat looking forward to this game when I first heard about it. These are just my opinions though, and as the game is free you can try it out if you would like.","November 2, 2014","false","1.1"," 63 of 94 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","63","94","0","5"

I honestly don't understand the negative reviews for this game, but it's clear that most of them haven't put in above 0.5 hrs into the game.\nLike I said, I personally recommend the game, but try it out and see if you like it.\n\nCounter-Strike Nexon: Zombies gets a score of:5.8/10.0\n"Not nearly as bad as the community makes it out to be. In actuality, there is hardly any p2w in this game, most of the new game modes are rather fun & unique, but the confusing & poorly optimised main menu screen, as well as the gambly crafting system might turn some people off.

Try it for yourself before you judge it.\n\nAt first I was pretty skeptical myself, reading all the crappy reviews saying how bad this game is, etc etc. After playing my first game I have to admit, I thought it was a deal breaker and I was about to uninstall it. But then I decided to give it another shot, and I actually had a good time! See here's what people are missing.\n\n1.) It's very different than most FPS games. You can't move when you get shot. Accuracy isn't even added into the game, or atleast very little. But that's what makes it more challenging. More fun. More rewarding to get kills. It matters more that you have to be in the right position, and be clicking that mother♥♥♥♥ing mouse as fast as you can.\n\n2.) It's got that old Valve half-life engine. Oldish graphics and sounds that make it actually nostalgic for old time gamers.\n\n3.) You can't take it seriously. I've played my fair share of counterstrike:source and what not. And I have to say I love both now. Both games are enjoyable with a group of friends. In this game, you're more than likely going to get killed by some BS.\n\n4.) Nothing is permanent, except for some customizations and what not, but it's not solely dependent on players who pay for their equipment. You can still play "fair". You can still buy things in the shop that are temporary, but attainable. You can still get kills. So to be fair, no, It's not "pay to win".\n\nAll in all, it's glitchy but enjoyable. I mainly play gun deathmatch, (which is essentially gun game in css). Try it out yourself.","October 26, 2014","true","21.2"," 205 of 346 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","205","346","6","7"

So here is my taste:\n\nIf you have played Counter Strike 1.6 you will love this game. It has all the classic game modes (Classic, Deathmatch, etc.), all the maps you love, and that classic valve engine. You can spend hours murdering the many noobs who dont know how to switch weapons, and its all a blast. "But isnt CS 1.6 on Steam?" you are asking yourself. And yes, it is. BUT that costs money, and this is free. You dont even have to play the Zombie mode, you can just enjoy the game for what it is: Counter Strike. The game we all wasted hours of our lives playing back in the late 90's. So all in all, great game, still fun, and I highly reccomend it.\n\n9/10","November 2, 2014","true","7.8"," 76 of 126 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","76","126","0","1"

It perverts the damn scene by using Counter-Strike in its name when it is NOT a true CS game and never will be.\n\nAvoid at all damn costs. F2P is great if there weren't so many better choices with the one time pay for CS 1.6, CS:S and CS:GO. Nexon is running on ancient gear, the game feels like its more of a money machine than an actual competitive, cooperative, fun game and if you really need Zombies, there are still great servers in CS:S, CS:GO continues to grow some more and honestly, if it wasn't for the CS part, this game would be another DayZ flop.\n\nThe Mixed Reviews are very warranted, keep reading your queue. I tried it and ran after seeing the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DRM Launcher they force you to use. Also, notice the lack of VAC? I could hack the launcher and give myself the ol spinbotting. And I hate cheating. That's how ♥♥♥♥-poor this game is.\n\nNewbies: Do not let this game be your introduction to Counter-Strike. Download CS:GO instead. http://blog.counter-strike.net/ Yes, CS:GO has Micro-transactions and a market like Nexon but you get no stat bonuses, its all purely cosmetic and the true point of it is to make yourself more individual than generic. You can pick what you want and if you no longer want it, you can sell it. Compared to the $24.99 dragon set in the listed DLC, you can sell $24 worth of ♥♥♥♥ in CS:GO and get over half of it back if you're careful.\n\nGood luck!","October 31, 2015","false","0.1"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","25","35","6","8"

I've   contacted Valve and they won't do it. Most large review sites only accept paid news articles. TotalBiscuit even refused it.\n\n\nThis will be a more serious review as it has the Counter Strike/F2P "click-bait" name to it. To put it simply, it's a Combat Arms Pay2Win/F2P first person shooter. It has parts of it that are entertaining and parts of it that are abysmal, even worse than CA. Calling it CS is far from the truth.\n\nMost of the modes suck outside of about 2. I recommend their equivalent of Gun Games called Gun Deathmatch (for balance), and the Zombie Scenario: Tracking (if you're interested in purely killing thiings mindlessly). Every other game mode is imbalanced and P2W-favored. The guns are weak unless you pay money or use cheats. Did I mention they use the notorious "Anti-Hack Shield"? It's useless if you're new to it. I'm not saying everyone cheats, it's just a useless system. There are no fidelity options, the game looks like s***. That's sorta a good thing because even bad computers easily push high FPS. But it looks like it was ported from PS2; it's bad. And the low reqs of it cause a lot of game ruiners to play. And no one talks on this game - text or mic. It's by far the leas strategic FPS I've seen and played, both due to gameplay and that communication issue.\n\nIt's the best F2P first-person shooter out there, to be honest. But that isn't saying much.. Even if you're very poor, I urge you to pay money for a game that doesn't suck. It definitely isn't worth playing. I left out some key points to keep this shorter, I just hope I prevents people from making the mistake of installing this. I cannot believe Valve backed it or it's called Counter Strike.... I suppose you can't expect much out of Nexon anyway.","November 17, 2014","false","158.3"," 61 of 104 people (59%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","59","61","104","6","4"

Counter-Strike Nexon: Zombies is pretty much a ♥♥♥♥♥ier version of Combat Arms, if you can believe that, with a classic Counter-Strike reskin.\n\nIt has the "free-to-play" FPS game menu, micro-transactions, everything. It's really sad that there was a group of developers working on this at Nexon and that Valve even trusted them in making a game at all. It's not fun at all, but it is free so go try it out if you are willing to download it.\n\nThere's hardly any option settings at all. The servers lag very often. The graphics, though mostly excusable, looks really bad. Everything is bad. Like I stated before, it's pretty much Combat Arms with a CS skin. The zombie models look almost exactly the same in both games and attack in the same way as well.\n\nIf you have a real desire to play some zombies, you can pick up Counter-Strike: Global Offensive and search for a "zombie" server to play on. Those servers are fun and are Steam-optimized.\n\nFor reference, I've played games from Nexon for years, Combat Arms specifically for 2 - 3 years before it went downhill from the addition of skills and increase in hackers. The hackshield does nothing, as always, and you bet your sweet ♥♥♥ that there will be hackers in CS Nexon: Zombies.\n\nThis is the Call of Duty: Black Ops II Declassified of the Counter-Strike series.\n\nObligatory Score: 3/10","October 8, 2014","false","0.3"," 63 of 108 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","63","108","0","1"

And this game is nothing like CS. If you think CS:GO is nothing like CS, just look at this.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are borrowed from a game from 1999. Graphics in a game don't matter, but it does help if you do manage to UPDATE THEM? There is no excuse to use graphics from 1999, considering this is a game from 2014, but at least the graphics are bearable.\nGrade: D-\n\nAnimations:\nThe animations are borrowed from CS 1.6, which would be fine, but this is a tense, action packed game. The slow reload animations meant for a tactical, slow-paced FPS doesn't fit in the game. Sometimes, the animations don't even work, and I'll think the gun broke, only to realize it just didn't display and manage to waste a round into a wall. The death animations for the zombies don't make sense. Most of them are just kneeling to the ground, rising, and falling again. I'm not a master in physics, but I'm pretty sure getting shot by an AWP, a .308 winchester rifle, would at least throw back the zombies instead of forcing them to kneel. CS 1.6 managed to make different animations for getting killed in different place (shot in stomach, shot in head, shot in back etc.) and THAT was made in 1999, so why not this?\nGrade: F-\n\nGameplay:\nTerrible. This is nothing like CS. This is fast-paced and action packed, unlike CS' slow-paced, tactical action. The weapons feel too powerful, as even a gun weak like the Glock 17 can kill a zombie in 1 or 2 hits. The start screen is pretty, but user-UNfriendly. I accidently joined a game trying to join a normal game. There are way too many zombies in the co-op game heading at you, and even though I set my gun as the AUG, I still get the machine gun that empties in 5 seconds. Despite it being action-packed, I often got very bored.\nGrade: F--\n\nSound:\nCan't really judge this, as the game borrowed many, many sounds from CS 1.6, but the music is very loud. I often couldn't  hear anything when music played.\nGrade: F\n\nVerdict:\n\nThe game is a cluster♥♥♥♥ of zombies coming at you, with loud music and animations that don't help the game. It doesn't deserve to have "Counter Strike" in the title. Fans of counter strike, this is not your game. I suggest any CS game but this.\nGrade: F-","June 22, 2015","false","0.4"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","20","30","6","2"

I'll admit  I  like  Counter strike  as I  have been  playing it since it's first iterations as a  modification for Half Life, and I  will  openly and  honestly admit with  no shame that it is  not for everyone and  the hardcore crowd is  kind of niche. and in some circles almost "cultish" in it's following.\n\nSo we  know it's not  "sacred" , just a well made mod that  grew organically into a  long standing well made  game series with  some  "spotty"  moments on it's reputation..it was NEVER  perfect but..\n\nWith  all of this  said...THIS unspeakable  piece of crap is  how Nexon  chooses to  handle the C.S. series  built upon the backbone of the  most revered version of  counter strike we have what can  only be described as a cancerous growth ... a  tumor  both  hideous to behold as it is  devistating to  it's host.\n\nPoor choices of modes,  poor Implementation  , no optimization  truncated menus and descriptions in said menus prove that Nexon  truly  does not care for the  consumer/playerbase.  Tacked on  thoughtless poorly balanced playmodes , patheticly coded poor  bots, unimaginative  zombie designs and gameplay better executed in  almost ANY  amatuer  mod of ill repute let alone one  that was crafted with  the skill and love that early  Counter Strike  mod revisions were.\n\n6-7 flavors  of crappy  couldn't be @$$ed to  care "zombie" / infected modes, a  money grubbing cash  greedy  "rent-2-PWN" gun/gear shop crafting system  designed by a  five year old huffing glue, a few  cheap "extreme"  font /U.I. changes that only make the whole experience come off as  cheaper than it really  ever was ( and note this is a "FREE to play" game so  cheaper than that is  pretty  deplorable.)  the best  maps in the game are the ones  that came from 1.6. but even they  didn't escape  being mangled  by fog and other pointless effects .\n\nThis is how Nexon treats a  well known staple of the E-sports scene and  much  liked  cornerstone of the FPS genre a classic..they  slash burn rip tear  mangle  and bloat the body  by exposing it  to only  Cthuhlu -knows-what.\n\nand this unspeakably  mangled unholy mess of a shambling creature wearing  a tattered skin of the   classic  Counter Strike is  what they  have been  pushing off  onto China and South Korea...\n\nI apologize China, South korea from the  bottom of my and many more  gamer's hearts, these sociopaths gave you a  poisoned pill  with a candy coating, they decived you and they  decived the ones who  saldy  lent them the rights to  license the Counter Strike series to your markets.\n\nTHIS is what is  killing  C.S. , this is what is killing gaming in  wide open markets that  are not  the US,Canada E.U. Japan Australia and  the other  "entrenched" markets.\n\nand the real kick to the  junk  not all  foreign markets got   this  HORRIBLE   wannabe  CS 1.6 with  mods..Japan actually got a GOOD Altered version of Counter Strike : Source called CS: NEO put out by Namco of all companies in  2005...\n\nTake a moment and let that sink in..2005  Namco had  one year to take  CS :Source which  was not as ballanced at the  time as even C.S. 1.3. they did more  justice to this series almost 10 years ago to the the moment I  wrote this review than  Nexon  did  since  getting their  hands on  the license in  2008 with  tech  that's almot 14 years of  work careful work ballancing out  1.6 to  be what it is  ..still one of the most  wonderfully ballanced FPS titles to ever exist.\n\nIt was never the best looking but it was one of the most studied, balanced and playable FPS  titles to this very day , and as of me writing this   a  pillar of  the  E-sports community  for it's execution.\n\nAll of that  hard work , all of that progress  was FORCEFULLY and willingly broken or  just  trown to the wayside like detritus by Nexon for a profit and it all culinated in this diasterpice  .\n\nI  have  played CS:NEO it's  actually  unmistakably  , unabashedly a good game it's just a region specific reskinned and visually altered  "vanilla" CS : Source  with a  few minor add ons.\n\nI would gladly  pay for that game even  with that with a  monetized gear / guns system hands  down over this with every last bit of pay pay content permanently  unlocked.\nI  would  still  gladly take CS:NEO  over this  mess even if  Nexon  paid me fairly to play this chunk of  awful intentions made manifest.\n\nThis is not a game...this is a  mugging over TCPIP.\n\nThis is a blatent  cash grab using a well known name drop. this is  an affront and an insult to gamers EVERYWHERE.","September 25, 2014","false","0.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

Yes, there's people who waste money on that (well, Nexon has to make some profit somehow).","October 9, 2014","true","342.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I've played every CS before this (except Promod, Neo, and 2D).\nThis is going to be a long review.\nFull review at the bottom\n\nOkay so before I start this off, I wanna say this: If you really liked CS 1.6, CS:CZ, or CSO, you're going to love this. Yes I know it's a Nexon game, but trust me when I say this, this is a fun game.\n\nI'm honestly really tired of people giving this game hate when they've only played the game for 0.3 hours and gave the game a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ score because they had no idea what they were doing. If you actually play the different gamemodes, relive the old classic maps, join families, play with friends, this'll be one of the best CS games you'll ever play. So yes. It's not just zombies. It's everything you could ever want!\n\nPros of this game\n+It's Free To Play\n+IT'S NOT PAY TO WIN\n+A variety of new weapons\n+Tons of gamemodes\n+GIRLS IN COUNTER-STRIKE\n+Ranking System that is far better from CS:GO's BS ELO Ranking system.\n+Families and Clans\n+Rankings\n+Achievements\n+Daily Missions to keep it fresh\n+All the classic maps and guns from the original CS titles are here.\n+Zombie modes are fun once you know what your doing\n+Community is mostly friendly and not cancer like CS:GO\n+GMs are always listening to community feedback and constantly update the game!\n+Runs great for older PCs.\n\nCons of this game -Small playerbase (we all know why)\n-Main Menu is confusing for first time players and is stuck in a 4:3 resolution.\n-Zombie Shelter and Zombie Mutant are BORING.\n-The game is very grindy when you reach level 25.\n-Graphics are "dated"\n-Not available in a few countries\n\nSo do I recommend this game? ABSOLUTELY! This game is free and many fun times can happen in this game. If this is your first CS, you may really enjoy this. If you care for graphics that much.......... go play CS:GO. The ammount of missions, gamemodes, guns there are in the game keeps me coming back for more!\n\nTL;DR / Summary\nThis is basically a port of CSO. IF you enjoyed CS 1.6, CS:CZ, or CSO you'll love this! Tons of variety and fun to be had when playing CSN:Z.

It seems like the just copied CS 1.6 and added some mods which you can find on any CSS or CS:GO custom server and they are better then this game. Also it startet crashing and deleting my settings for the first five minutes until i finally could choose my username which is unchangeable and isn't the same as your steam username and must not contain any characters that are not numbers or letters. following this you can't set the graphics higher then 1280x1024  so there is no option for hd quality and in this times it should be standard to have hd graphic settings. Given the fact that this game is free to play it probably will be full with hackers in the next days and they can create new accounts over and over again. Also given the fact that there is an shop for weaponparts this seams to become pay to win even if the publisher states that you can get all the parts by playing the game, but the question there is how long does it take you to get one part and how fast can you buy it?\nEnding this review  i have to say i spend more time writing the review than having to play the game without dieing because of how bad this game is and that it calls itself Counter Strike.\nI think this is a very dark day in the CS history and i hope this game doesn't become very popular.","September 23, 2014","false","0.1"," 59 of 106 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","59","106","0","4"

I won't lie, I REALLY enjoy this game.\n\nMore guns, fun game modes, sometimes huge challenge and yes game is kind of broken, but broken things usually are fun at least for me. It's true, zombie scenario mode have issues, It's so freakin annoying when you have to shoot something for 98342785423 hours just to destroy another thing that takes even more time to destroy, but I do liked A LOT boss battles. This game ISN'T pay2win. You can get everything important for free, like blueprints and materials by daily login rewards or mission rewards or by random drop in the game. If you want to have other player model or have some more stuff, go on and pay for it, support developers, but you really don't have to do that. And hey, CS1.6 for free. With all those new awesome guns.\n\nOf course, game has flaws. Like I mentioned before, repetitive Zombie Survival and really annoying "Zombies will be back", "We has been enslaved by the zombies" thing over and over again after zombie kills someone on some game modes, it gets so annoying, but I can live with it. I also sometimes got into a hacker or two and there are sometimes lags, but I'm not sure if that's from me, host or game itself, again, wasn't too much of a problem for me.\n\nOverall, it's a great game in my opinion. It's fun, it's broken and it's great that we finally have a chance to play CS: Online. Some of those zombie designs are creepy as ♥♥♥♥ man, you smell Asia from them.\n\nTL;DR: Give it a go, you might not like it, you might hate it live everyone else.

This game does not deserve to be called "Counter Strike" , mainly because when you say Counter Strike , you think of Valve. And when you think of Valve , well , you think of perfection . I will write this review in the most honest way i can and you will see why Nexon is the worst game released this year.\n\nThe game\nThe game is basically just CS 1.6 with its main focus being on Zombie Escape maps. There is nothing special about it , it's just the free version of the original Counter Strike that a poor person with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC would download. You start the game (after hundreds of tries and connection failures) and you just get confused :  TONS , and i mean TONS  of menus and other things that don't do anything in particular. After about 20 seconds you get a pop-up message which tells you to choose a nickname . Unfortunately , even after you put your name and click OK , the message keeps appearing saying to put your name . 30 seconds later another pop-up message saying that the game lost connection will appear. You click OK and the game quits itself to the desktop.\n\nGameplay\nThis piece of junk's gameplay is even worse than its menus. Apparently , the brilliant controls in CS 1.6 were ignored by the devs , so they created their own controls. You will find out that your character shoots with F , changes weapons with left click and many other settings that are not appropriate for a gamer. You will find it hard to move , aim ( sensitivity set to -1 ) , shoot , etc.\n\nThe game's main focus\nAs the title says , the game focuses on zombies . You have the same generic Zombie Escape modes that you see in EVERY SINGLE Counter Strike . The game also has classic modes , but the main color is gray combined with a dark blue , so you will not see anything , you will not know where to plant the bomb and so on .\nThe Zombie Modes are in high number , but they are all the same . Either you're running from the zombies or confronting them face-to-face , you will feel the same .\n\nWeapons...?\nIf you hate anime , like I do , you will realise that the weapons look too unrealistic , that they're not designed for humans . They are either too big , or they tend to occupy three quarters of your screen so you cannot see the zeds ( zombies ) coming from your right . The game also includes melee weapons , but again , they're too cyberpunk for my tastes.\n\nThe maps\nThere are so many ♥♥♥♥♥♥ maps in this game that you'll start to cry. The game includes a few ugly-as-hell maps that have two main colors : red and black . Pixelated red and black\nThey are so bad , and you get stuck in so many corners that you will rage quit almost instantly.\n\nThe community\nThe community is either formed of little 12 year olds that think this game is "new" and "next-gen" , or people like me , who are completely confused as to why would Valve add this to their free-to-play section\n\nThe final verdict\nOverall , this "game" is disgusting . Its gameplay , maps and community (half) are just an offense to Counter Strike . I added an extra point in my final score because i laughed so much with my friends at how bad this garbage is\n\n\n2/10","October 11, 2014","false","1.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","10","14","4","6"

In the game all players are humans. After few seconds one of you becomes Zombie. One hit = Become Zombie. Humans have to survive for few minutes and Zombies have to turn all humans into zombies. The game is acceptable as a Human, but as a Zombie you will have hard times. If group of humans shoots at you, there is nothing you can do - you can barely move, you cant shoot (maybe you can with different zombies but i was not able to do so) Unfortunately, most players feels to be heroic and just run around in open area. There are also alternative gamemodes for this, for example when one of humans becomes a "Hero" with special gun.\n\nOther gamemode is zombie survival (or how its called), which sounds nice, but is actually pretty bad. All players play for half hour in same small area. Every wave many zombies spawn everywhere... and you literraly have to keep turning around to kill everything thats coming your way. If someone was spectating, they would think that you are dancing.\n\nZombie Scenario... or something like that... there are randomly chosen few random zombies to chase humans. They have to follow the signs and run. Sometimes they have to press something or shoot something. As a zombie you actually have to do the same... but instead of trying to escape - youre trying to hit them and turn them into zombies. I had slightly more fun playing this gamemode.\n\nThe highlight of this game is Zombie Shelter mode. You have shelter and you have to protect it. During day you have to gather resources around the map, look for black market to buy a weapons. During night there will be horde of zombies trying to destroy your shelter. With resources you can build turrets, walls and other buildings. To win, you have to kill two bosses.\n\nThere is lot of alternative gamemodes to these and there is also a "Original" and "Basic" gamemode. Thats just classic CS 1.6 with small changes.\n\nMain Menu feels very uncomfortable. Craft menu contains pointless PIN code screen. If you try to end the game, game will try to convince you to keep playing with "You havent finished your Special mission" or "You did not accepted your daily reward"... Even leaving the game before the end of match will result in loosing 100 points. I have no idea what are those points for.\n\n+ Lot of gamemodes\n+ Shelter Mode\n+ New weapons\n+ Players of older Zombie mods will love this\n\n- Gameplay as Zombie\n- Main Menu\n- Some booring gamemodes\n\n5/10\nIm giving it a Thumb Up, because it is actually enjoyable game, once you find out how to play that. :)","September 25, 2014","true","6.6"," 91 of 169 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","91","169","0","0"

(melee, pistols, smgs, shotguns, rifles, snipers, machine guns and even rocket launchers!!!\n- Daily, weekly and even monthly missions which rewards players with blueprints or durables after completing them.\n- Events which can help earn more XP and Points (in game currency used to buy and craft items).\n- Ranking system, competitive play.\n- Can create families (like clan thing).\n- Logging each day awards you with items.\n- Playing gets you rewards which are used to craft weapons and other helpful stuff.\n- Zombies!!!\n- More things yet to come!\n\nNow, this game does have optional microtransactions but there are not required and most of the items and weapons can be acquired just by playing and crafting except for skins/classes but that could change in the future and items such as medkits and revivals can be purchased with in game points/currency.\n\nI am also aware that Counter Strike Nexon: Zombies is known as Counter Strike Online in Asian markets but it wasn't available anywhere else till now.\n\nSo far (as of writing of this review) I haven't experienced any major issues with the game and I've already put over 200 hours into it. My favorite modes are Zombie Scenario and Human Scenario.\n\nGame does look old but the gameplay is still fun and anyone can play since it has very low system requirements.\n\nIf you liked old Counter Strike 1.6 and Counter Strike Condition Zero you should check this one out because this game is free to play and you got nothing to lose so go ahead and give it a try :)\n\nPS: Ignore all the negative reviews and check out this game yourself since it doesn't take long to download and it doesn't take much disk space either.","October 24, 2014","true","821.8"," 52 of 95 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","52","95","0","2"

Though they gained moderate success in their time (perhaps due to a lack of true competitors) it is only now we have the clarity to see what a farce these 'sequels' were.\n\nCounter-Strike Nexon: Zombies (CSNZ) reinvents the wheel whilst it's predecessors only put new tires on.

Everything that was in 1.6 is here as well, and more. So why are people hating it?

The start up menu is a tad wierd but not really that bad at all going just a little but under my monitor. Once the real game starts it fixes and there are different modes to choose from such as zombie scenario,hero,defense. yeah it's an old engine but that just helps the people out who can't really afford a nice computer. overall yeah this game could be better but it still doesn't deserve all the hate it gets.

Though not as fun alone, when you have these people called "friends" it makes for a great experience. Though yes some improvements can be made, such as a round start timer for the original mode (I haven't seen one myself), less structure health on Tracking mode,  the hidden should be more like source, where he remains only slightly visible and you have to watch for certain things to find him, and plus no respawns in that mode (Reason I mention the hidden stuff there is because it makes it way to fast pace). Anyways thats my 2 cents on this game. Play for yourself, everyones opinion is there own... even if its wrong :D\n\nI forgot to mention that the Menu UI is terrible and needs to be the same as the in game video settings. Also there should be more resolution settings (such as 1360x768 for me).\n\n(If there are other things I feel need to be here I'll edit it in.)","October 14, 2014","true","31.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

But i fell in love when i got to play it on CS Source i said, holy ♥♥♥♥ this is AWESOME , half of my hours on CS source are on zombie escape. So one day  i though, this is so good, why do not anybody makes a game about this?. Oh boy. When i saw counter strike nexon zombies i said, hmmmm counter strike and zombies gj valve, i though at the moment.\n\nSo i opened the game and the problems started even before i joined a match, i clicked play and i waited like 10 minutes because an anti-cheat stuff was analyzing me, i was like OK, im sure i wont find bad people or hackers on this game at least.\n\nThe menu is kind of league of legends style, so i did not say anything. My first match was Zombie hero , which a zombie is picked randomly and he needs to infect everybody on the map, and humans need to make a camp spot so they can survive. Nothing wrong, right?.  ALL WRONG, i was playing on italy the only good camp spots were in buildings, i was like "no zombie will get us" but i saw people like falling back and i was like "are you scared or what?" , then i was flying in the sky and fell into the zombies, Why?. EVERY ZOMBIE CLASS has at least 2 GRANADES, Why a zombie would have a granade lol?.\nSo i played like 30 min of that, and then i went to the mode i was waiting for, oh glorious zombie escape. I dont remember the map i played, but i noticed that with a knife you dont run any faster, which is a really big  disadvantage! I was like ok, lets get through this.\nHORRIBLE, at least on CS source you had times when you needed to shoot all the zombies that were coming, in that map everybody was running escaping and thats it lol , like a marathon. The map was short really short, and people threw flashbangs in the most important parts so we would mess up. And there was a part in which you needed to be like the first one running because you needed to press a button to make an elevator WOrk and people had 3 seconds to get in . Wow.... I got rekt in that part too many times, even one time i got killed by the elevator... JUst beated it once. I played like 13 rounds.\n\nIn conclussion:\n\nNexon, you should not be proud of ANYTHING. The modders that do not get the money that you are getting right now are more dedicated, they do better maps. And they even work with a BETTER ENGINE.  I just see people playing it because its free to play and i tell them, Counter strike source zombie escape is the best one , and they answer  me, is that a PC game too?.\nI think that you should release a second installment with the source engine soon and fix that balance problems (seriously, who needs flashbangs and smoke granades on zombie escape, and zombies MUST NOT HAVE WEAPONS)\nAND PLEASE, REMOVE THAT ANNOYING VOICE "THE ZOMBIES WIL LBE BACK" , I KNOW THEY WILL RE-SPAWN!!!!\n\nGraphics: 5/10 (gld source engine on a new game?)\nGameplay: 3/10 (The mod is better than this)\nSound: 1/10 (Some weapons sound cool because that were their original sound in CS, but the new weapons sound awful, and that annoying voice, oh god , and the zombie radio chat is SOOOO ORIGINAL)\nPerformance: 5/10 (You may say, why 5/10, this game runs on a ♥♥♥♥ing potato, First, im not getting the frame rate i should, i get 70fps but i do not get more, and there are people out there on the servers playing at 30fps, the gld source engine is one of the best optimized engines, and CS 1.6 did not run like this!)\nOverall: 4/10\n\nThis game can still be fixed, if they want to balance it, but they do not care, people play it and they think they are playing something good....\n\nP.D: Needed to close the game as administrator because the quit button and the close button did not worked....","September 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","4"

Graphics are from CS 1.6 so it looks terrible but runs good on a potato with a screen stuck in it, running on the power source of a toaster. I mean seriously you cant focus on the graphics?! I've seen Facebook games with better graphics! It's CS zombie mode with Nexon slapped on it, btw if you have ever played a Nexon game and you dont like p2w, DO NOT! Secondly it's EXTREME P2W. Textures are horrible, guns are like they are from a COD game, voice acting stolen from 10 year old prirated B-movies, and AI mapping that will completly screw you over with a spoon.

It is a very confusing game because it is marketed as a version of Counter-Strike with Zombies, but acts more like a free to play shooter that happens to have similar textures that look worse than Counter-Strike: Source. Not only are the textures terrible, but it is not possible to run the game at any form of high resolution. I run all my games at 1600:900 which is absent from this game all together. Now for the gameplay, it is just flat out terrible. There are two types of games in this game all about micro-transactions, which are sort of traditional Counter-Strike PvP and some terrible version of infection game types. The normal Counter-Strike PvP feels terrible and is a poorly made PvP game type. It is just traditional deathmatch with very simple spawn points with conflict only being in the middle of a very boring designed map. Then the zombies PvP is the same thing as the traditional PvP, just with one team being zombies. It is exactly like any custom server you can play on with the traditional Counter-Strike: Source, and looks worse. The game is heavily based on it's micro-transactions, making it so guns are just "trials" that you have for like 1 to 3 days. This game is very poorly made and I do not plan to play again any time in the future.","October 11, 2014","false","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Its a free to play game with super low computer requirment i mean.. a super bad dell laptop can run this game... so dont expect god graphics games like Crysis , BF woldenstein or the division. For all of you that never played cs 1.5 1.6 please dont give shet comments saying how bad this game was a legend it was classic.","October 31, 2014","true","24.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VACdBOIII/recommended/273110/","VACdBOIII","For sale- Worth almost $2K","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VACdBOIII/","167 products in account","OK first off, this is and always will be one of my favorite games of all time. Im talking about CS 1.6... But besides that, This game is actually very fun\n\n\nYour able to get premium weopons without paying for them, so long as you just play\n\nThe only thing that they have to buy currently are players and weopon crafting stuff, witch isnt needed. KEEP IT THIS WAY\n\nCounter strike is one of my favorite games of all time. I play it alot\n\nHackers havnt been a problem yet\n\n\nIts made by nexon, so sooner or later there will most likely be NX shoved down the throat of this game. Leaving nothing behind but people who pay to win. Witch isnt reccomended, you guys there at nexon have enough money to fully fund the cure for cancer 5 times over. So dont F that part up\n\n```````````````````\nBad stuff\n```````````````````\n\nMade by Nexon\n\nThe recoil in this game... NEEDS ALOT of work. When im aiming down the sights with my revolver with my scope, and the dots right on the guy, and i still see the bullet wiz to the right or left or any direction and hit the wall behind him. I Freak out. Because I was aiming at him. Not moving. Crouched. Still missed, and it still happens here and there. I feel like the recoil in this game has specific percentages on how much your moving, if your crouched, and the crosshair does NOTHING to impact how and where you shoot. So fix it, seriously.\n\nFamily is a cool and new thing thats in this game. Its like a clan, only CS own little way of saying what it is. Manage it and send out notifications EXC. Join other familys, have storages that people can access....... The one thing that NEEDS to be set differently is the time on where you can join one family. What i mean by this is that when your in a family, you leave for some reason or another, and you wanna join another family. You HAVE to WAIT 2 weeks untill you can join another family. My friend was in a family before just to see how it is and all that, then he left and I invited him to my own that I made myself. He couldnt join and we were both ♥♥♥♥♥♥ the ♥♥♥♥ off, it doesnt tell you that you have to wait. It lets you go and makes you regret the decision. Fix that Please\n\nThe maps are cool, some are really small but hey, whatever ya know.\n\nGame types are different from what ive seen in alot of games ~\nBeast- Fight at a church and kill other people. Theyl drop these stones that anyone can grab, get three of them and turn into this big beast they call the yeti. Multiple people can use it at once and itl become a one big beast fight in the middle of the map to see who the fastest clicker is. Its decent\n\nTDM/Original/Bot TDM/ Arms race / DM\n\nBasic gamemodes that most FPS shooters have, same concept, different game, different guns, different maps.\n\nOther gamemodes that are ok\n\nScenerios\n\n` Basicly just one building, or area, where you the player choose your weopons and and fight big waves of bosses, and bots of couse. Each with there own set of health, weakpoints , weopons and killing styles. There are currently only 2 scenerios, Zombie and Human.\n\nWeopons\n\n` Theres quite a few for a just launched game. So Clap clap on that. Recoil needs help.\n\nMelee\n\n` Its decent, make sure to aim the crosshair right at the guy your trying to wrek. Otherwise youl miss and get humililiated.\n\nDisc space isnt that much, maybe 3 GB, Good for a remake of a game\n\n\nOne other thing. Theres thing called Zombie Shelter.... WTF were you thinking when you made that gametype. Theres no tut, i had no idea what i was doing. Money making is ♥♥♥♥, and when people leave on like round 5, and your all by yourself you might as well just quit. Cause when u die you lose everything, including money you took 5 hours to get. So when you see a match with that. Keep scrolling.\n\nTheres Plenty more, but its 2 in the morning and i have school at 8 #Sophomore\n\nEDIT_-_-_-_\n\nOk, so newest update came out. Cool.\nNothing i noticed really. Maybe connection stuff? They say trading cards are in, when i dont see any in my invetory!\n\nRecoil is better though. Thank you on that one.\n\nOne other thing. I was playing in a match, and when all the terrorists were dead on DE_Dust2 the game wouldnt end. So we all ran around and attempted suicide many times,\n\nCrafting needs updating. Ive been getting so many fails its not even funny. I bought a Weopon enhancment kit, and seriously 3-10 of them failed. WASTE of points, I get that it fails sometimes. But not 7 out of 10 times. So poo on that till it gets updated","October 13, 2014","true","40.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Please check out my profile for more reviews. :D\n\nThis game is a very terrible copy of the originaly Counter Strikes. It adds zombies in which look like pixels with high quality, runs on an "I need money! Help the producers today!" engine. Realistically, if you enjoy Ace of Spades or Black Ops 2 survival horde mode, this may be your thing. However, once the virus is started, it takes over a clip of ammo to kill a zombie. Note that most of the time, the maps that you play in are short ranged. So, yeah, you're kinda screwed when they attack you at close range.\n\nThe headshots seem to do nothing, the pictures on the title that actually look realistic are fake, and once you made you died several times, for some reason, most people on the server dislike you. I don't understand why this couldn't be improved, but the only thing I truely enjoy about the entire game altogether is that you get to play Counter Strike 1.6 for free. But I already have it. In fact, I have all of them. And I have enough experience with games to notice that this is a poorly made game.\n\nThe horde mode/base protection, whatever you want to call it, is actually fun. Untill you get to level 11. You need at least 7 team members to survive through it, and all of them (hopefully) have to be really good players. The glitches are terrible with all of the spawn of "zombies" (I geuss the developers thought those bunches of pixels looked like zombies) around every corner. I ran towards a zombie with full Level 9 health (135 health) and when it hit me (it was a normal one), I died immediately, resulting in a long length of impatience staring at my screen.\n\nSadly, the others are quite messed up as well. The graphics are just like some crap was smothered and then handed to the online players and makes them believe it looks truly "realistic". I appreciate the time that Nexon put into this game, since, if order and layed out correctly, it would have been a good game, but, once again, unfortunately, we have some poorly coded AI units that run around you at random directions and use their weak meelee multiple times, making you overpowered.\n\nThanks for reading this, and all in all, I procede to announce this review with a 6/10, which, in my book, is quite bad. Note that this was made a few months after the release, so hopefully (even though they probably won't) the company that developed this game in three minutes flat will realize, "Oh, wait, this is a crappy game," and improve it throughout the further updates.\n\nAgain, thanks for reading this, and check out my profile for more reviews on popular games.","November 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","2"

Then here you go! You've found it!\n\nThis very poorly designed mod of the source engine is the classic example of people stealing something that is amazing and turning it into a sad attempt to grab cash and make this game an unplayable joke.\n\nThe loading is slow, fails half the time and throws a bunch of useless junk into your face that as a new player you have no idea what to take of it. You get daily encentives to log on every day, but the items you get are lousy and just be bought with several real dollars, so who cares? Why wait 7 days to get a random skin or gun you can just spend 2 dollars to get.\n\nThe regular mode is just an slightly altered version of the original counter strike, with the bots mod the only viable versus mode due to the rampant pay to win culture. The zombies defense can be fun if played with friends, but gets very busy and difficult hard, and to top this is the rediculous hit box zombies have, making it nearly impossible to even play anytihng but turret spam defense. The guns are garbage, late game the zones to buy ammo are nearly impossible to access due to poor zombie coding and the overall fact that this game is just ugly in colour.\n\nIt didn't take me very long to kick this game out of my libary, after just 10 minutes of looking at the main menu and jumping into a zombie game, me and my two friends instantly laughed at how bad this game is.\n\nDon't try it, and expect only headaches from this pathetic money grab.\n\nPersonal Rating: 1/5","October 29, 2015","false","3.6"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Here's a few things i like, and then ill do the pros and cons-\n\nIt has that "P2W" feel (guns lasting a few days) without actually using any real life currency. i personally like it. the crafting system determines how long the gun will last, and then you can upgrade the gun itself. its pretty creative, and iv'e never seen anything like it. The level design is fairly decent, maps tend to be pretty small besides the zombie co-op gamemode (forgive me, i forget the name of the gamemode) but overall, it feels like a counter strike game with a lot more variety.\n\nPROS:\n-Customize buy menu with countless guns\n-upgrade your guns\n-p2w feel without real life currency\n-ZOMBIES\n- plenty of AI and Non AI gamemodes\n-decent clan system\n-has that classic counter strike feel without it feeling like just a mod\n-in-game leveling system (level up your speed, attack, ammo, etc) as well as overall leveling system (unlock and craft more/better guns)\n\nCONS:\n-took some time for servers to come up\n-occasional server crash (only happened 1 time out of my total play time)\n-takes some time to get used to crafting, upgrading, etc\n-rounds can be LONG. I played ONE ROUND that lasted more than 2 hours (co-op)\n-Penalties for quitting a round (when you shoot mindlessly at AI for over an hour without any progress, you get bored quickly)\n-getting new guns is determined by chance\n-overall pretty small maps (personal preference)\n-some guns are OP\n-takes a few tries to actually log in upon start up (give it a few tries if it doesnt work the first time)\n\nOverall, i would reccommend this game to anyone who's a fan of Counter Strike, or even just survival horror games althogether. The replay value is very high, and seeing how this is a beta, that says a lot. It's worth a try, its relatively small (i believe around 2-4GB) and it doesn't take a supercomputer to run. it's a fun game in my opinion, and ill definitely be partaking when it has its full release.

Terrible game with trash community and you will barely find someone who speaks English but when you do he's going to curse at you. If you want to get the good weapons you'll have to spread your wallet wider than a woman spreading her legs when she's giving birth. Terrible pay to win game.\nIf you want to craft a permanent weapon...GOOD LUCK.\n\n-It used to have missions that rewarded you with decoders and you had a fair chance at winning a permanent weapon but they removed them because apparently there were people who abused it. So instead of actually fixing the problem they just showed us how not to deal with it and removed them from the mission rewards. Now you will have to waste 3 hours of your precious time in this terrible excuse of a game so you can get 3 decoders.\n\n- you can play bingo for nice rewards. But now that you can barely get any points from the decoders it'll take you months to actually get something. Did they really think this through? I don't think so...or maybe they just didn't care.\n\n-Some skins are terrible. They blend in with some walls and you can barely see them from a far. Add a little bit of lag and you have it.\n\n-Who in their right mind wakes up and says "I'll make an invisible zombie that is able to jump high"? Fire that guy.\n\nBut we know that the reason is most likely so people would buy the decoders from the store. If they really valued their players they would do that but what do you expect from a game made to grab cash.\n\nI regret every second I spent on this and I am here to help you guys so you won't do the same mistake. Do you see the amount of hours I spent on the game? This is the amount of times I had to get exorcism so I could get this abomination out of my system.","May 17","false","160.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","10","17","5","10"

Well, it depends. The concept behind this game is solid, but it has a poor implementation. Out-dated graphics, for instance. Also, it tries to be a CoD: BO2 Zombies or modded CS:GO. In my opinion, it doesn't live up to either of those games. Black Ops 2 is really fun, I played Zombies a lot on my console, but it's worth the time you'd put into it.

There you have to escape the infected people or infect the humans as a zombie and prevent them from winning.\n\nThe awful thing in this mode is that if you are a new player that is in the human team with other new players, you will lose in just a minute. Any hit from the zombies is an insta-kill, so you have to keep moving and outrun the zombies. But, you can succeed more if you buy in-game stuff with your (parents', if you are a kid) card, more specifically waste your real money. Also the new weapons have a time limit, unless you craft a permanent gun. But you won't need to empty your pockets when you discover that this game also has the Original Deathmatch servers.\n\nYep, the classic CS gameplay: CTs vs Terrorists and struggle to win. It has all the popular maps such as Nuke and de_dust, all the weapons such as Deagle, AWP, MP5, P90. Here the only thing to win is to get skilled. Altough sometimes the hit detection is weird (e.g. once I got a headshot, even though it was a bodyshot), this mode is playable. Watch out for wall campers, there are more of them in this game than in 1.6!\n\nIn spite of the negative reviews I saw around here, CSN:Z offers a lot for a F2P game, and you can definetly have fun with it.","October 8, 2014","true","80.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So to my fellow Australians, have fun getting hit from a map away with you 400 ping delay\n\nNexon has taken a mod that was just a bit of fun on CS, and made their own version of it with a pay to win scheme, and all the problems the original mod had. Which was basically that on some maps vent or crawlspace camping saw the humans dominate and on others it's impossible for the humans to win.\n\nI do not recommend this game to anyone. I instead recommend you fire up CSS, CSGO and just find a community server with the zombie mod installed.","October 8, 2014","false","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The gameplay  of cs go with the zombies and opportunities of left4dead. This could be the best game al times. The screens and trailer looks amazing but now i gonna play it.\n\nThe graphics and maps is even WORST then gmod. Some maps are the same as cs and gmod but it's made like a nintendo95 game. The idea aka the point of the game is still a little bit strange of me but i figured out one mode and that is  be a terrorist or a Counter-terrorist but you work together... (little bit strange) and you need to kill the zombies what is really hard. But if you're a zambie you can bite the terrorist and then they became zombies; Great idea! But this beta is really really really low quality. If they can make it with the same graphics as cs go, but the same idea's who are already in this game, it's gonna be the best game ever. For now i don't say no, but i don't say yes either. It needs a lot of work and then it's gonna be GREAT! So i gonna say yes because its pretty fun to play but it can not compete with other games like cs go and L4D2!","September 25, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There you have to escape the infected people or infect the humans as a zombie and prevent them from winning.\n\nThe awful thing in this mode is that if you are a new player that is in the human team with other new players, you will lose in just a minute. Any hit from the zombies is an insta-kill, so you have to keep moving and outrun the zombies. But, you can succeed more if you buy in-game stuff with your (parents', if you are a kid) card, more specifically waste your real money. Also the new weapons have a time limit, unless you craft a permanent gun. But you won't need to empty your pockets when you discover that this game also has the Original Deathmatch servers.\n\nYep, the classic CS gameplay: CTs vs Terrorists and struggle to win. It has all the popular maps such as Nuke and de_dust, all the weapons such as Deagle, AWP, MP5, P90. Here the only thing to win is to get skilled. Altough sometimes the hit detection is weird (e.g. once I got a headshot, even though it was a bodyshot), this mode is playable. Watch out for wall campers, there are more of them in this game than in 1.6!\n\nIn spite of the negative reviews I saw around here, CSN:Z offers a lot for a F2P game, and you can definetly have fun with it.","October 8, 2014","true","80.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am from polish (U know i am good english).Too much fun,Zombies and The Most Thing Bots.Bots are great for begginers.There are many gamemods like:\nZombies:\nU know how to play\nEscape Zombie:\nIn this gamemode you have escape,before players (Zombies) get you. You have limited time. If time gets 0 whetever or not zombie wins. There is not many map but its fun to play. Some escape must like how many distance you go,survive and wait for chopper,and others. The Most Points Wins!\nSoccer:\nWell Valve thank you for that adding this gamemode. Easy rule, get the ball,and get goal to get points. But hey! For getting close to enemy goal will couse damage you. And the most impoart you CAN respawn. If you die you will respawn where you die. The most points Wins!\nOriginal:\nYou know what is this.\nZombie Save:\nIn this mode it never ends untill save house will be destroyed by zombies.It took me 2 Hours to end it.Its Very Fun. You cant win! Like a Soccer you respawn die. When you die you will respawn to save house+you lose all items what you got but thats ok for me. Well you can build sentry and others,that makes game long. It is fun,but boring for some players.\nZombie Co-Op:\nIn this gamemode you actully killing Bot Zombies,NOT players. In this mode is survive and escape,then chapter will change to boss battle,that means you need defeat boss to complete chapter. You lose if all players is dead. You can still have fun pressing r (I think) it will restart and you with friends trying again. Still you CAN respawn. But if you keep dying the time will make extend.\nThats all i can tell some gamemode.Others all there but i dont remember.\nThat only who ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off is creating weapon,its real s*** like you always fail to craft some weapons,sometimes you have luck,sometimes not.I always have't got lucky so this thing pisses me off.\nThis is: BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!\n9/10\n-Crafting Tools","January 19, 2015","true","24.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I mean VERY easy. No tutorials, just choose a server and get into the game!\n-The game just throws items at you, and you can have a great time without any microtransactions.\n-1.6 on drugs. Seriously, the weapons are so out of place I actually like them. There are the music instrument AKs, weapons that look like Nerf guns and even a LEGO assault rifle that can be transformed into grenade launcher! Doesn't that sound cool?\n-Solid zombie mod that uses the same "1.6 on drugs" principle. The most OP weapons and the most interesting character designs out of all Korean shooters.\n-It is so good that just like the original 1.6 it became a standard for the (Korean) FPS games.\n\nCons:\n-Menu. It is locked to 720p for some reason, so if it is fullscreen, just Alt+Enter from it. The game itself isn't locked though.\n\nVerdict: Pretty playable, but not suitable for competitive play.

Guns are literally just there to push them back so you can run away. it takes an entire ♥♥♥♥ing team to kill 1 zombie after they literally unload hundreds of rounds into the zombie. what the ♥♥♥♥ is the point of that. my steam profile pic may make it seem im a happy camper with this. but deep down im so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off with it. Zombie Escape would be so much better if there was a larger amount of people playing and you can actually KILL the zombie. You dont feel like a unit when playing. you just run and hide then when a zombie finds you you pray more dont show up knowing theres NOTHING you can do to kill it unless you had 10 other people to shoot it. Plus that ♥♥♥♥ing zombie announcer "the zombies will be ba-the zombies will be ba-the zombies will be back." this stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ wont shut his damn mouth. PLus there needs to be some better maps. The Zombie A.I. are special, and I dont mean the high honors special. I mean short bus special. Theyll bunch up in corners and get stuck alot. However they still do pose a threat because of their large numbers\nThere are some good things with this free to play. it has a lot of potential. Zombie Scenario is a fun mode, Zombie Shelter is probably good if you have an actual team to talk to. I had a teammate in that mode and all he did was die and say "im in position." The reward system is cool along with this crafting thing ive been lookin at. My verdict is 4/10. What the ♥♥♥♥!

There are MUCH better f2p games out there and sadly this one isn't very good.\n\nThe positives:\n- Nostagia for those of us who played the original CS when it was a mod for HL.\n- Sprays.\n- The original de_dust map.\n\nThe Cons:\n- Laggy to the point of being unplayable.\n- Terribly outdated engine and graphics.\n\nOverall:\nBetter to just get CS:GO and avoid this. 1/10 and the 1 is for nostagia. This game should have been on the current CS engine, or even use the original source engine.

In Teamdeath Match, Expect the most often used map is Dust 2, and Spawncampers. This is one of the reasons why new players deter from the game, thinking it is "Pay 2 Win." In Zombie pvp modes, Expect the mode on Hero mode and mainly on maps with camping/glitch spots. Other pvp modes are often not played at all, like soccar/hidden. The Best modes (in my opinion) by far are the PvE "Scenarios." Zombie scenarioes is the most played mode in the game, with ofc, zombies while completeing the map's specific objactives, like survivial, boss fights, and more.\n\nEnjoyability: 8/10 Good\n\nThere are many ways to enjoy the game, like exterimating the scenario bosses, hordes of zombies, and even getting premiums from the the soficicated "Decoders." But there ARE somethings that really takes away from it, like Blockers (Zombie PvE most common), Getting spawncamp by the opposing team, having bad decoder luck(getting all crap), etc.\n\nQuality: 5/10 ehhh.......\n\nThe Graphics are very outdated to start off, since CS:NZ is basicly a westernised port of CSO. Weapons very geartly with unique abilites and "Anti-Zombie" weapons. There are still a TON of explots/glitches within the game for getting out of map, etc.\n\nOverall Score: 6.5/10","April 8","true","352.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

This game was a hidden gem in a pile of ♥♥♥♥. The core gameplay of its "origional" modes play similar to that of the beloved game Counter - Strike 1.6. Although this is a great feature of the game, what really struck me as this game being a hidden game in the once great free to play world, was the actual promoted zombie survival/senario mode. Its thriller nonsense and endless waves of zombies kept me and my friend captivated and motivated with the game mode. While being a great game mode it still has a lot of point deductions on my behalf. Just as an example of these said point deductions from the game, it seems like the "EASY" game mode isn't really easy. I quote, "It feels like playing round 95 in black ops zombies...", but nevertheless this hardness of the gamemode actually enticed me to play the game more with my friend. It is a wonderful gaming experience if you have a couple of friends to play with. Also, its great if you got VAC banned in CSGO, im not pointing any fingers....\n\nI rate this this game a solid 8.9/10 Coconuts.\n\nIt would seem i dont have enough hours on it but, i played this so much on my alt account...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/woofyhound/recommended/273110/","woofyhound","woofyhound","http://steamcommunity.com/id/woofyhound/","21 products in account","Do yourself a favor and avoid this game, this is not like CounterStrike at all.\n\nI've played CS:1.6 and CS:CZ which are very good games and worth the asking price. This on the other hand is if you took those two games and mixed them with Battlefield Play4Free, and then took a huge dump on it.\nThe User Interface is all over the place and can be hard for new players to understand how to use it, and it litters you with all kinds of promotions and ads for items in the game. Although, once you finally understand how to navigate your way through the insane UI, you will quickly find out that it really is just a butchered version of CS:1.6 with micro transactions all over the place. The re-desings of the old CS maps are not all that great, everything feels way larger than it should feel and the new alternate versions of the maps are really nothing special. The audio is also like CS:1.6, only louder and in lower quality, even with all the audio options set to maximum.\n\nNow for the big one, that being the zombie mode. To put it simply... it's very bad. It really feels like nothing more but the original zombie mod from all the other CS games, and dumbed down to it's simplest form. Either, run away from the zombies with no tactics or pre thinking what so ever, or run around shooting the zombies with no tactics or team work what so ever, and the zombie shelter mode is just so boring, with no pun intended, brain dead zombie ai walking around aimlessly while your turrets fill them with holes and send them back to their boring hell where they belong, or to heven if they are lucky enough.\n\nNot to mention that this version of CounterStrike has no modding features what so ever, because all the events are actually rooms instead of independent servers. Instead, you choose from a couple main servers depending on your geographical location in real life. Because you know, CounterStrike was never known for all of it's mods and community made game modes it has.(To anyone who doesn't understand, that last sentence was sarcasm.)\nI really am trying to find somthing good about to say about this game, other than you can choose from female characters, which is good. But saddly you can only get those if you give them 9.99 USD, which completely destroyed any positives or upcommings for this game.\nThere are some other things I forgot to mention like crafting and perks, but I have to be honest with you, I really couldn't bare anymore than fourty minutes with this game. Come to think about it, I would have probably have never heard about this game if it weren't for a Youtube I saw while watching a video. I wouldn't have even bothered with it if it weren't for the fact that it was a "Free to Play" version of CounterStrike.\n\nMy final words to you are, if you think this is the Free to Play version of CounterStrike that you have been all waiting for, it really isn't, not even close. If you want to play CounterStrike, then buy any of the other CS games there are, but don't waste your time on this. I hate to say it but, this game is a disgrace to the CounterStrike community.\n\n3/10 not recommended unless you are really looking for a Free to Play First Person Shooter.","October 24, 2014","false","0.8"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

You are true about Nexon being a company that looks only for money,i admit that but step by step i see that they are making the game more F2P-ish ; I played the singapore/malaysia version and that game dissapointed me a lot, and that ping omg (390 every single game) , that game it's the true definition of pay2win.  CSN:Z isn't like that (at least not entirely) ; If u take a look in the shop there are just a bunch of blueprints and durable things that only cost 1 euro and if u play some hours u can get those things for free just trought gameplay (this game unlikely other CSO games are build for the "crafting" , rest of them are "buy the item for a lot of cash"). Points that u win in game are kinda useless. Graphics? Well its still a 1999 game engine so it's pretty ok in my opinion .","March 8, 2015","true","455.0"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","13","24","3","0"

Honor Mission (or Achievements) - The hardest mission in CSN:Z. Can you do these missions? for example: Clear all daily missions within a day for [Perfectionist] medal. The reward of Honor Mission is "Medal" and "Honor points". The medals can be used before a player's name. Example: [Perfectionist] PlayerName. You can change color of medal with your honor points. (100 = green, 250 = blue, 500 = purple, 1000+ = red)\n\nHuh? Zombies are hard to kill? Don't worry, CSN:Z also has "Anti-Zombie" weapons that can do fatal damage to those zombies (This effect can be seen in Zombie modes only) You can get these weapons from crafting too!\n\nAll weapons from classic CS are in your Inventory for permanent! Zombie skins with different ability also added to your inventory for free and permanent!\n\nWant play same as CS 1.6 ?

And then you mostly have the contents of this game.\n\nBased off CS 1.6 this game forces you to kill boxes, with many thousands of hitpoints, 15,000-30,000, and this was pretty unbearable, but then imagine that the makers decided that having the amount of damage dealt to these boxes scales down with the amount of people in the game. When you eventually get to a "boss" it is simply one of the aforementioned boxes that does an insignificant amount of damage per attack, but suddenly will use it instant kill move. To give perspective, it can use this move with no consequence, no warning, and no escape, even right as you respawn it can do it.\n\nThe makers of this game clearly thought that harder difficulty=higher amount of enemy health, and even on easy difficulty this game is a rediculous waste of time, that will bore you to pieces while you shoot boxes blocking the path.","October 9, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffmylife/recommended/273110/","jeffmylife","brightlights misses hisCSfriends","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffmylife/","74 products in account","This is a very unique experience and totally changes the dynamics of counter strike. The PvE was somewhat dry in my opinion, and resembled Sven: Co-Op in that you essentially plow your way alongside other players through a linear map fighting back wave after wave after wave of enemy and completing certain tasks (usually blowing up a barrier that has 30,000 health) to get to the next area. There are buy zones interspersed for you to load up on ammo or switch out guns and it usually culminates in a big boss fight. It's kind of droll and there's not much of a challenge.\n\nWHERE THIS REAAAALLLY ****REAAAAAAAAAAAALLLY**** shines however is the PvP mode where some people are zombies and some CTs each round (randomly selected).\n\nEach zombie type has special powers, like an iron maiden it can slam down to stun enemies and hide behind, or a hoard of bats that grabs the human you aim it at and drags him toward you. The humans (CTs) have a slew of all the classic CS guns and some extras, with a much higher ammo capacity.\n\nThis mode can be SUPER intense as you spawn throughout familiar classic CS maps and try to get to high ground with other humans, since one hit from a zombie and you become one and join the hunt. Zombies have thousands of health points, but are slowed down by being hit so a group of humans can often protect themselves or give another a chance to excape, but once the guy next to you takes a scratch he'll kill you.\n\nPlaying with just a couple people is really cool too depending on the map... it becomes more like hide and seek and can be VERY intense. I played with 2 others on the classic estate map and I kept jumping as I was attacked out of nowhere, since the maps are darkened to create a tense ambience.\n\nThis mode makes it SO worth the download and since it is  free game, you've GOT to try it out... I was hooked after a couple rounds.\n\nHappy hunting! :)","February 7, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With some counter-strike like maps and game modes. I wont lie I always have and always will dislike the idea of hourly or daily limited items. Gameplay of survival game mode I thought was unique because it got harder as the round progressed, and as the rounds progressed. Crafting I am sort of neutral on it depends on how it is setup. It mostly depends on if its going to be open market through steam. If it is going to consist meerly on how it is setup right now I dont like it. Graphics for a beta for what the game describes it to be, it is what it is a Free 2 play, with original counter strike play and feel.\n\nBasically I think there are many things they can expand upon, and I think they are on a good start. I think if they progress the customization, the crafting, and have a open market through steam market. This game could become a good base for a mmofps. Maybe have a Item/skin involvement with CS-GO.\n\nI am recommending this game not for what it is right now, but what I think it could turn into.","September 25, 2014","true","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With some counter-strike like maps and game modes. I wont lie I always have and always will dislike the idea of hourly or daily limited items. Gameplay of survival game mode I thought was unique because it got harder as the round progressed, and as the rounds progressed. Crafting I am sort of neutral on it depends on how it is setup. It mostly depends on if its going to be open market through steam. If it is going to consist meerly on how it is setup right now I dont like it. Graphics for a beta for what the game describes it to be, it is what it is a Free 2 play, with original counter strike play and feel.\n\nBasically I think there are many things they can expand upon, and I think they are on a good start. I think if they progress the customization, the crafting, and have a open market through steam market. This game could become a good base for a mmofps.

How can they even justify using the old engine of CS 1.6 when they have a partnership with Valve?\nThe gameplay is laggy and dry, half the games do not even run on any sort of zombie mode and overall this game seems like an effortless pile put together by an unskilled modder.\n\nOverall this game is a waste of the bandwith it takes to download it, anyone thinking about playing this for zombies is better off just playing zombie mod servers on CSS or CS:GO.\n\n-A bunch off people will now give me FLAK saying its in beta and theyll fix everything but most of the things i listed (just a small piece of the cake of whats wrong with this game), are not excusable by beta or alpha or as this game feels a unfinished pre alpha build.","September 24, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Wasted an hour shooting walls and a boss. (quite literally.) The mision involved shooting barriers with enough rounds to kill a whole country. There were 3 of those things. Then then boss was the biggest bullet sponge ever. This game is only good if you are a masochist who wants to have bragging rights for playing 10 games straight. It almost makes me hate Valve enough to not use Steam anymore. It is that bad. This monotony is like if COD did 10 tons of every drug it is so dumb. OH MY FRIGGIN GOODNESS!!! SOMEONE FRIGGIN KILL ME!!!!!!!\n\nLong story short it is not even worth the bandwidth to try this steaming pile of shiz. VALVE REMOVE THIS CRAP!!!

Was boring as hell.\n\nIn this zombie match, me and various ( about 9 other ) Counter Terrorists were constantly attacked by zombies and had to keep moving through streets. It sounds fun, but is awful. VERY awful.\n\nFor the whole experience, I had about 7 machine guns blazing in my ear as well as "Fire in the hole" going off every 2 seconds.\n\nThe gameplay was bad too. What happened was, we had to move through streets. But, every 20-30 seconds, we had to stop and clear a barricade. These barricades had about 30,000 health each. What you had to do was get about 8 people shooting down the barricade and the other 2 people shooting zombies.\n\nThe zombies were really easy to kill. They had low HP, and each time they attacked they dealt 1-2 damage to you. What's worse, is every few zombie kills, you would get a level. These levels seemed to increase your max HP pool by about 5 per level. While it sounds reasonable, it was easy. For the first 10 levels, it took 1 zombie kill per level. And so before you know it, at level 35ish I had 380 or so health and was practically unkillable. I'm not sure if it was just me, but health seemed to regenerate. And fast.\n\nSo for the whole experience, it was easy and boring. You shoot at walls 75% of the time and after each match, you become partially deaf for an hour unless you play without sound.\n\nI understand I only played one gamemode, but I really couldn't be bothered playing more, and thought I might as well just share my experience here in review form.\n\n\n\nNEXON:\n\nWhat other people are saying, the game is another Pay to win game. I didn't get much of a look at the store, but I did play another nexon game quite a while ago called Combat Arms. This and Combat Arms have very similar looking stores.\n\nIn combat arms, I can't remember what item it was, but I remember paying about £27 for a single item in the store.\n\nThat item lasted a week.\n\nBloody Nexon...\n\n( Yes, that was a while ago, I'm now not stupid enough to spend that much on any single item that has a duration )","October 8, 2014","false","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffmylife/recommended/273110/","jeffmylife","brightlights misses hisCSfriends","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffmylife/","74 products in account","This is a very unique experience and totally changes the dynamics of counter strike. The PvE was somewhat dry in my opinion, and resembled Sven: Co-Op in that you essentially plow your way alongside other players through a linear map fighting back wave after wave after wave of enemy and completing certain tasks (usually blowing up a barrier that has 30,000 health) to get to the next area. There are buy zones interspersed for you to load up on ammo or switch out guns and it usually culminates in a big boss fight. It's kind of droll and there's not much of a challenge.\n\nWHERE THIS REAAAALLLY ****REAAAAAAAAAAAALLLY**** shines however is the PvP mode where some people are zombies and some CTs each round (randomly selected).\n\nEach zombie type has special powers, like an iron maiden it can slam down to stun enemies and hide behind, or a hoard of bats that grabs the human you aim it at and drags him toward you. The humans (CTs) have a slew of all the classic CS guns and some extras, with a much higher ammo capacity.\n\nThis mode can be SUPER intense as you spawn throughout familiar classic CS maps and try to get to high ground with other humans, since one hit from a zombie and you become one and join the hunt. Zombies have thousands of health points, but are slowed down by being hit so a group of humans can often protect themselves or give another a chance to excape, but once the guy next to you takes a scratch he'll kill you.\n\nPlaying with just a couple people is really cool too depending on the map... it becomes more like hide and seek and can be VERY intense. I played with 2 others on the classic estate map and I kept jumping as I was attacked out of nowhere, since the maps are darkened to create a tense ambience.\n\nThis mode makes it SO worth the download and since it is  free game, you've GOT to try it out... I was hooked after a couple rounds.\n\nHappy hunting! :)","February 7, 2015","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And then you mostly have the contents of this game.\n\nBased off CS 1.6 this game forces you to kill boxes, with many thousands of hitpoints, 15,000-30,000, and this was pretty unbearable, but then imagine that the makers decided that having the amount of damage dealt to these boxes scales down with the amount of people in the game. When you eventually get to a "boss" it is simply one of the aforementioned boxes that does an insignificant amount of damage per attack, but suddenly will use it instant kill move. To give perspective, it can use this move with no consequence, no warning, and no escape, even right as you respawn it can do it.\n\nThe makers of this game clearly thought that harder difficulty=higher amount of enemy health, and even on easy difficulty this game is a rediculous waste of time, that will bore you to pieces while you shoot boxes blocking the path.","October 9, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

People think it's bad because when they play they can't figure out how to be the zombie or they hating because they can't seem to agree with the graphics.\n\nThis game has everything i love about games in it, guns, zombies, chicks with low amounts of clothes on, and some how soccer. Yes the games graphics are not the best, and it has a few glitches but that just makes the game more fun to play with your bro's and all your m8's. I mean when i saw that there was a "counter stike online 2" i was like HOT DAMN, GIMMY SUM OF DAT. but insdead they made this game which was like woah.

Honestly, I think this game is another fantastic addition to the franchise.  The multiplayer modes and maps take us all the way back to CS 1.6, the good ole days!!

There are a few bugs out there, but this game isn't pay to win at all, and the gameplay is not only classic, but fantastic!

(60Hz monitors capped at 30FPS) The game might support higher resolutions, and works fine in terms of launching the game and getting into a match. The main menu in this game is actually restricted to 1024*768 the last time I checked. There are limited video settings, but I didn't expect much since it is a GoldSrc game.\n\nYou cannot mod this game, instead it opts for you to use it's cash shop. The problem is with the cash shop is that it isn't just weapon skins and player models, it's also expensive weapon rentals. You can rent overpowered weapons by buying them, or using blueprints. Nexon tries to downplay this by giving you a whole bunch at the beginning and a little as you play the game, but once your joyride is over and you've had your fun with all those weapons, it's gonna take some time to get blueprints again. (Summed up? It's PAY TO WIN)\n\nSome call it a free to play Counter-Strike 1.6 for it's Classic mode (Bomb Defusal/Hostage Rescue). Thing is, those cash shop weapon rentals I talked about earlier really throw the entire thing off. There is literally a grenade launcher you can get that can kill people in one good hit, plus splash damage.\n\nNow, Zombies. The Zombie mode is pretty much the same thing as the one's you find in Counter-Strike 1.6. The models might be a higher resolution, but there's nothing too different. There's also a Basic gamemode, which is for newcomers to the Counter-Strike series in general, but it doesn't help as it adds hitmarkers and a lot of other things you'd only expect in Call of Duty.\n\nIn conclusion, just get Counter-Strike 1.6. It's more optimized and plays better than this.","July 10, 2015","false","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(60Hz monitors capped at 30FPS) The game might support higher resolutions, and works fine in terms of launching the game and getting into a match. The main menu in this game is actually restricted to 1024*768 the last time I checked. There are limited video settings, but I didn't expect much since it is a GoldSrc game.\n\nYou cannot mod this game, instead it opts for you to use it's cash shop. The problem is with the cash shop is that it isn't just weapon skins and player models, it's also expensive weapon rentals. You can rent overpowered weapons by buying them, or using blueprints. Nexon tries to downplay this by giving you a whole bunch at the beginning and a little as you play the game, but once your joyride is over and you've had your fun with all those weapons, it's gonna take some time to get blueprints again. (Summed up? It's PAY TO WIN)\n\nSome call it a free to play Counter-Strike 1.6 for it's Classic mode (Bomb Defusal/Hostage Rescue). Thing is, those cash shop weapon rentals I talked about earlier really throw the entire thing off. There is literally a grenade launcher you can get that can kill people in one good hit, plus splash damage.\n\nNow, Zombies. The Zombie mode is pretty much the same thing as the one's you find in Counter-Strike 1.6. The models might be a higher resolution, but there's nothing too different. There's also a Basic gamemode, which is for newcomers to the Counter-Strike series in general, but it doesn't help as it adds hitmarkers and a lot of other things you'd only expect in Call of Duty.\n\nIn conclusion, just get Counter-Strike 1.6. It's more optimized and plays better than this.","July 10, 2015","false","11.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Honestly, I think this game is another fantastic addition to the franchise.  The multiplayer modes and maps take us all the way back to CS 1.6, the good ole days!! But the most remarkable part of this game is easily the zombies!  In this game, they take an old idea (zombies) and add so many new modes and ways to play that it becomes utterly addicting.  There are a few bugs out there, but this game isn't pay to win at all, and the gameplay is not only classic, but fantastic!  With some patching and more work, I would go as far to say this would be the Free to Play Game of the Year.  97/100","October 13, 2014","true","83.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

PLEASE NOTE: This is a beta review, my complaints could change, but I don't see that happening since this is Nexon we are talking about.  Yes I am aware that this is in beta testing right now, but that is why I reviewing it, to help Nexon (if they choose to do so) fix their game.  ALSO NOTE:  I love Counter-Strike, all of them.  So this negative review is not based on my liking of CS.  Now, on to the review.\n\n\nFor starters, this game is Pay to Win up the booty, which is just not fine for any type of CS title, even if it is created by a different company.  Every weapon you get dissapears after so long, so have fun spending your time on a weapon that will last half as long.\n\nSecond is Sounds, and good lordy, are the sounds hilariously bad.  I actually had played this with my friend so I didn"t experience the pain by myself.  While we were playing, we first joined a lobby and were thrown into a cluster-duck of dumb, bland zombie moans, an announcer that sounds infected repeating "the zombies will return" and things similar to that, and a guy on the radio calling in a supply drop, but the guy calling it in sounded like he just had his testicles squished in between to hammers.  In the span of those 5 seconds, I was crying with laughter because of all of the insanity of sounds.\n\nNow for the gameplay, which isn't much better.  Yes, there is a classic mode, which is just CTs against the Ts, but that can't even save this game from the endless and yet almost identical gametypes with zombies.  Just to kill a single zombie, (depending on what game type you are on, on some the zombies are litterally impossible to kill) it takes about 2 clips from an m4, which is way too much to kill a single zombie, as opposed to the zombies' one-hit kill with the secondary melee.  Not exactly fair.  As far as graphics, I don't ever honestly care about graphics, so long as they aren't painful to look at, but unfortunately, I found many textures that were just plain ugly and painful to look at in this game.  I love classic graphics, but there is a difference between classic and just plain bad.  Also, I guess I should mention that there are AI zombie modes, but its like a modded Killing Floor server that gives you too much money, and with really stupid zombie AI, and by "stupid" I mean walking into walls, walking past you, etc.\n\nWow, my fingers hurt, so I am going to say one more thing, if you like this game, goody for you.  I am not saying it is wrong for a person to like this game.  I mean, this is classic Counter-Strike with zombies!  But sadly, they did everything wrong with the concept of CS with zombies in my opinion.\n\nMy final verdict would be a 3/10, since it is free, and it is Counter-Strike, and I wish i could love this game like I wanted to,  but this was just not what I, or many others, wanted.  If Nexon could make this game more like-able, then someone please let me know when they do, I will gladly play this to change my review and update it if it is positively, dramaticly  changed, but this was just a huge let-down.","September 24, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But if you actually put the effort into the game you can unlock some cool sh!t.  I'm still a little confused on why your crafted weapons are limited but that gives me an excuse you change things up. Apart from a few crashes I've had no other problems with this game, so I do recommend you give it a go, if you don't like it, fair enough and move on.","December 7, 2014","true","126.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The thing with this game is its so poorly synced. Shots still hit you when the enemies body is long gone, Sometimes you see blood and do no damage, its just no as good as cs 1.6 unfortunately.","September 24, 2014","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I personly can not get enough of this game but i can see why people feel it is unfair or like bad. But a game like this you can't find anymore it's one of those games you can come back to and be like OHHHHHHHH it's this game, i use to love this game. People think it's bad because when they play they can't figure out how to be the zombie or they hating because they can't seem to agree with the graphics.\n\nThis game has everything i love about games in it, guns, zombies, chicks with low amounts of clothes on, and some how soccer. Yes the games graphics are not the best, and it has a few glitches but that just makes the game more fun to play with your bro's and all your m8's. I mean when i saw that there was a "counter stike online 2" i was like HOT DAMN, GIMMY SUM OF DAT. but insdead they made this game which was like woah. Even though this game replaced one that looked alot better and things changed its still an amazing game.
