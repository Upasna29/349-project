"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScarletTail/recommended/353270/","ScarletTail","Summer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ScarletTail/","128 products in account","This game has a niche target audience so I'll do my best to outline it below. If i have to give a rating I would give it an 8/10 and reccomend getting it on sale. I'm very aware that while I enjoy these games reccomending them is a bit dodgy as alot of people simply will not like what this game is. It does what it tries to do but that wont appeal to ALOT of people.\n\n\n\nREASONS NOT TO BUY THIS GAME:\nThis game is not mechanically deep, characters roles are pretty simple to figure, beyond buffs debuffs and manipulating the turn system theres not alot to learn, the last one is a nice touch but still not a good game for someone who wants to think hard about their strategy.\n\nStory is pretty poor in general (though not even close to as bad as rebirth 2 imo) and it has alot of repetition in monsters, dungeons etc.\n\nThe game is rated 12+ and that age level seems appropriate so if you're looking for adult images, look elsewhere. Fanservice is tame and sporadic.\n\nIt has quite alot of post game content through the free dlcs but unfortunately there is pretty much no way to progress to the last 4 areas or higher level fights in a  natural way. To do these you simply turn on the "in-game power level hax" and grind levels for an hour or two. This means that to keep things fun post game you have to carefully balance your levels or else you will be annihilated/untouchable.\n\nThe difficulty is a bit low for alot of the games until you reach the ultra late-game at which point it reaches stupid levels and the only way to balance is essentially to be really careful about how you break the game (see above point)\n\nThe 4th wall gets SMASHED repeatedly here. All the games broke the 4th wall but this one just completely ignores to the point where even I got annoyed in later chapters and I'm normally immune to it.\n\nREASONS TO BUY THIS GAME:\nThe games characters are the main draw. Its a mix of a visual novel with a turn based rpg and the characters keep the visual novel element highly entertaining for the most part. Having all the dlc characters active can make it a bit too much dialogue wise so I reccomend not using them for a first playthrough if you intend to do more than 1. Some of the characters might drive some people crazy and as obvious as it might sound, anime like characters and reactions are plentiful so if you like anime you probably have a higher chance of liking this though I'm sure its not necessary.  Having plutia and Nep as the 2 of the 3 main characters pretty much makes this game for me.\n\nIs funny.... well I think so anyway :D\n\nThe battle system while simple is fun to play and the animations are really smooth. If you have played the other games you have a good idea whats going on but this one is a step up on this front, not anything massively different just little things that make game more fun to play. The entire interface is massively improved in this game too, it still has its flaws but the menu in this game alone is enough to make it the best of the three.\n\nTheres a challenge system introduced where you get little bonuses by completing challenges and while some of them are a little painful and the higher targets in many are RIDICULOUS, its still a nice addition.\n\nThe game isnt too short at about 40-60 hours for a casual playthrough of true ending if you read everything, certainly not long by rpg standards but long enough that you wont feel ripped off.","November 20, 2015","true","110.0"," 179 of 194 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","179","194","9","6"

What else would you expect? Oh and let's not forget about Plutia/Iris Heart, oh God.\n\n\nShould you buy this game?Nepu. (Nep's way of saying yes)\n\nNep-Nep/10\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOkay okay, I'll be serious this time.\nSeriously though, it's a fun RPG as I enjoyed Re;Birth 3 the most out of all the Neptunia games, so I definitely recommend this.\n\nStory!Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 V Generation takes place a couple of years after the events of Re;Birth 2 and so, I won't spoil much of the story, but to summarize, Neptune all of a sudden gets transported to another dimension, landing in another Gamindustri very similar to the other Gamindustri that she knows. Along the way, she meets some new friends and very familiar faces along the way and maybe some new foes. Will she be able to return back to her home in the Hyperdimension? Or will she forever be stuck in the Ultradimension?\n\nDungeons!As much I really liked this game, most of the dungeons have been recycled from the previous games. When you unlock new dungeons, they pretty much look almost like the exact same areas from the previous games and previous dungeons you've been to, except maybe some of them would have slight changes area wise, but that's about it. There's only a few unique dungeons in this game, like the ones in the Hyperdimension Planeptune where you're in a city and such. There should be more unique dungeons like those to keep the game fresh.\n\nMost of the DLC from Victory are now free in Re;Birth 3 so that's a plus.\n\nPlans!Another additional feature regarding plans is that now finding the materials to make the plan is a lot easier. It will now tell you where you can find the materials you're missing, how you can get them, and what monster you need to defeat in order to get those materials. Now that's a huge plus!\n\nColosseum!The Colosseum provides a challenge to the players that are looking for a challenge along with unique rewards. However one problem I've had was that the game would crash on me sometimes when I try to start a Colosseum battle. Other than that, everything else runs smoothly.\n\n\n\nPhew! Now that was long!\nShould you buy this game?As a Neptunia fan, definitely! Looking for a good RPG?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxer00/recommended/353270/","maxer00","Maxer00#2311","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maxer00/","130 products in account","Third time's the charm (?)\nFan's rejoice - the third game of Neptunia is here! Other gamers take a peak - another anime-style JRPG is here!\nBut is it a plain copy of the previous two games, or maybe it had some major improvements that makes it the best (Neptunia) game so far?\n\nStory\n\nRe;birth 3 once again places the player in the Gamindustri world, ruled by Goddesses[ideafintl.com]. Each rule a nation that represent a console company (Lastation -> Playstation, Leanbox -> Xbox, and so on) All seem peaceful after  the events of Re;birth 2, but our lazy and goofy main character just had to get herself in trouble again, didn't she?\n\nThe story is of the same pace as the previous games - it doesn't take itself too seriously, with it's long-winded boobie talk just before a serious boss battle, obscure gaming references at every single corner and blunt 4th wall breakings (The main character lives just to break it). But even so, Re;birth 3 probably tells  the longest and most decent story out of the 3 so far, which I personally enjoyed greatly. But do take note, that if it's a story-driven RPG you're looking for, you might need to rethink if this is what you're after.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game's battle system remains mostly unchanged. It's still the typical turn based JRPG battle with the exception of being able to move the characters around for flanking and accurate special skill attacks (trust me it's much more simple than it sounds). The only change is the merge of SP bar and EXE drive bar, which is a healthy change. Before, you could just spam SP attacks and then finish it with very powerful EXE attacks. Now, you have to use SP for both specials and EXE attacks, so you have to play more smart.\n\nThe dungeon exploring remains mostly unchanged besides another very good change: the hidden treasure is no longer an invisible item in the dungeon that you had to spam a button to radar-search for it, it's now a mostly transparent Mario-type block that casts a shadow that the player can bump his head into for extra loot.\n\nThe levelling system finally feels balanced, the game doesn't suddenly throw in undefeatable mobs to get killed by, and you don't get too powerful too quickly (unless you use certain Plans...)\n\nThe Chirper also returns which is a direct replacement to talking to NPCs in other RPG games. It basically has almost zero use besides getting references, funny thoughts and similiar things. Though for some players it might be something to look forward to during each chapter start.\n\nAnd the fun auto-exploring Stella's dungeon minigame returns again. This time, with more stuff to do. And with faster exploring too, which is a plus too. And this minigame also solves the problem of farming for materials as you can get a lot of them from the minigame too, while doing something else. Like reading the plot.\n\nSpeaking of plot, you will be met by a lot of it. A lot of text that is. Sometimes it really pulls the player out of the action just to read dozens of lines of text. While story is important, from time to time you may feel as the "actual gameplay VS story reading" balance is off. Luckily you can still choose to skip the text relatively fast, or set it on AUTO, so you can read/listen to it while eating even!\n\nOptions. There are not many. You can switch the resolution, camera sensitivity, fullscreen mode, language and there are sound sliders. Also key bindings. Other than that there is not much to choose from.\n\nAnd finally the Remake/Plan system, one of the highlights of Neptunia Re;birth's game mechanics for me. As before, it allows the player to "alter" how the game works. What that means is basically this is the unlock system. You want new dungeons? Unlock a plan and then gather materials to make a new dungeon. Need more items armor clothes etc.? Repeat what you did for the dungeon. And while this Remake system offers a lot of changes (Monster strength, BGM music change, Clothing, Stella's dungeon additions), it's not as hard to farm all the required materials for all the plans to unlock everything. Which is certainly nice.\n(Unless you're one of those people who need to unlock a "My waifu" accessory for all the girls, in which case farming is your problem, buddy!)\n\nGraphics and Sounds\n\nThe game's as colorful as before, looks beautiful in 720p and higher, the character models remain unchanged and that's fine since they do look splendid. A first time player will certainly enjoy the way they look and move, while those who played the previous games might wish for more variety or change. The dungeons and monsters are also more or less the same, with some healthy additions, but a veteran player will certainly be bothered by enemy recolorings and same dungeon re-using.\n\nAll of the cast is fully voiced, with menu and overworld included. Only a few cutscenes are text-only. Each dungeon type has it's own BGM as it should, and boss fights have their own too, though some are re-used from previous games. I personally didn't mind it, as the music is not an annoyance in Re;birth games.\n\nJapanese versus English\n\nThe game originates from Japan as you may already know. But the cast is voiced both in japanese and english, which is quite awesome. The quality of both is superb so choose whichever you fancy more - squeaky typical-anime-ish japanese, or "dub" english. (Please don't take the "dub" part seriously)\nThe only minus I had with the localization is the fact that the translated story text is still full of          *achem* memes. It's not as bad as it was in Re;birth2 where you couldn't take the story seriously due to how the translation partakes the story in the wrong way. And trust me, when somebody tells you to "stabby stabby kill kill" another person while dramatic music plays, the experience is ruined. Luckily as I've mentioned, the translation got better and it's not as off, as it was before.\n\nDLC's & Bugs\n\nA surprise - the game comes with all DLC's besides the Stella dungeon goodie (which is still a very useful DLC). That means you get to use up to 28 instead of 10 characters if you wish. And grind up to 999th level instead of a measly 99.\nThe DLC characters get a few sub-stories which is a nice addition. And strangely enough they get more stories than in previous games where (most of them) were already in the game without DLCs.\nYou also get extra super equipment Plans. But if you don't want none of that you can always turn off the DLC's before starting the game, which is quite helpful for those who wish to do so. And whether you'll want to grind to the max is up to the player, as the extra dungeons do not introduce any more important story additions.\n\nThe game sadly comes with some bugs that don't allow players with low amounts of RAM or with certain Intel integrated graphic cards to play the game without crashes, so beware of that. Some are easily fixable, which is a relief as I myself had to find a quick fix for my own crash issue. I suggest reading up on any other potential game breaking issues before deciding to get the game as you may or may not encounter problems along the way.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nAs a fan of the Neptunia series I was pleased by Re;birth 3: The game's performance got a boost. The story got a boost in length and quality. The gameplay was also balanced for a more enjoyable experience. And while the game still does not let go of it's habits of reusing old material, and it's grindy parts for the completionists, I feel that this game is certainly worth a try for both fans and those who enjoy a not-too-serious JRPG experience. Unless you're a very serious gamer who takes his games seriously, and you require a serious plot and seriously amazing gameplay I recommend this game. It's quite fun.","November 12, 2015","true","72.5"," 42 of 51 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","42","51","0","0"

Also, different sound effects like birds singing in background when you're in a forest area are nice extra details.\n\nOverall, it's more of the same and I don't think that's a bad thing. The animations are improved, and it's just fun.\n\nThough I will say, for best results...play with a controller (just like all the other Neptunia games).\n\nMy only real complaint is how long it takes after boss fights with every character having a level-up (and with all the included DLC characters....that's a LOT of level-ups). But that's a really minor annoyance.\n\nAlso, Nepgear best girl","October 30, 2015","true","28.6"," 64 of 91 people (70%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","70","64","91","18","0"

I expected a lot from this game and i  am not dissapointed with any part of it .\n\nThe story is gorgeous. There is no way I can explain it. I really liked Re;Birth 1's story, felt average with Re;Birth 2's one, but I never felt bored with the storyline of Re;Birth 3. I was pleasantly surprised with the length of the story itself. In previous games it was up to 6-7 chapters. In V Generation there are  10 chapters . Lets have a look at the cons first, because, in all honesty, I did not find a lot of them:\n\nCons:-Game happens to have an fps drop when there is around 5-6 CPU models on screen, however if one of them disappears from your sight (for instance, by rotating your camera), framerate goes back to normal. It happened about 2 times in my gameplay.\n-Some of the difficulty mechanics still hover around how many of your party members can get one shotted at the same time.\n\nI really can't think about anything else. That's it. Really. I have not experienced anything else besides that. The quality increase between both first Re;Birth's and Re;Birth 3 is HUGE.\n\nNoticeable pros in comparision with previous games:+Amazingly good plot\n+Free DLC characters with fully voiced events\n+NewGame+ content got expanded a lot and the game itself has a lot more content\n+Extra combo slots + challenges which increase statistics of characters\n+You can (finally!) rewatch previous events\n+You can (finally!) preview items before buying them\n+If character in the first row dies, you can switch her to her back buddy, and this actually is a huge game changer for end game\n+The game does not force you to play all over again in order to get one item if you missed one dungeon at one exact chapter\n\nSummary:This game is more than i have asked for. I have spent almost everyday playing it in order to relax and i loved every chapter, every dungeon and every quest i have completed. At the moment i have finished my first playthrough of the game which took around 52 hours. I really recommend the game to everyone and if you liked any of previous Neptunias you will fall in love with this one for sure.\n\nThis is how Hyperdimension Neptunia should've looked like from the beggining. Now, if you wonder if you should buy it, considering you are at that part of the review already, you most probably should.\n\n10/10 My favourite game.","November 25, 2015","true","91.4"," 28 of 35 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","28","35","5","2"

Sound interesting? If yes, you'll probably LOVE this game. If not, you'd better stay waaaay over there! No, a few more steps backwards ... there!\n\nBigger and better, Rebirth 3 takes the series back where it belongs.\n\n\nPros:\n* Very funny (unlike Rebirth 2)\n* UI and mechanics improvements over previous titles\n* Bigger\n* Best story in the series (so far)\n* Friendly to people new to the series\n\nCons:\n* Easy\n* Lack of new moves\n* Some 3d cutscenes still as low-res as in the previous ones\n\n\nTo me, Rebirth 2 felt lackluster after the first game. The story wasn't as funny or as long, and dialogue dragged on with neverending pointless Chirper messages. Rebirth 3 feels like it goes back to what Rebirth 1 was: hilariously funny and full of protagonist wackiness and fourth wall breaking. The story continues after Rebirth 2. It feels more developed, and thanks to its nature and Nepgear's helpfulness it's easily understood by new people to the series. All old characters in the series return as playable characters although all of them don't participate in the main story. There are also some great new additions to the cast.\n\nThere are several mechanics improvements which make me happy. EX and SP point systems have been merged which makes skill management a bit more interesting. UI in the menus have improved. Stella's Dungeon now has a friendly drop list for dungeons and monsters. The map is bigger, with multiple layers and screens, providing space for more dungeons. No more search spam for hidden treasures; they have a new mechanic and are spotted visually. Visuals are also slightly better. The gallery is big, there are plans for changing BGMs and old scenes can be reviewed.\n\nUnfortunately at the point where I'm at, the game feels a bit too easy. When I played Rebirth 1 I didn't feel bad about turning on Easier Enemies. Now I feel like I want to turn on Harder Enemies instead. The combat doesn't offer as much to old players as it could. The old characters all seem to use their familiar moves. The graphics in some 3d cutscenes are blurry and low-res, which can probably be blamed on the PS VITA original.\n\nI'm thoroughly enjoying this one! Jury is still out, but possibly the best in the series.

I'm done drinking the kool-aid, stopped believing in false deities, and I've been Nep-Nep free for ... not even a year. Oh No... As much as I hate to admit it, Compile Heart's opus to moe console wars has succesfully stolen another 40+ hours of my time. Instead of playing Undertail or whatever it is the kiddies are going ga-ga for, I surrendered myself to the latest entry in the Neptunia Saga.\n\nNow why would I do such a silly thing?\n\nBy now, we're all familiar with how the Hyperdimension Neptunia formula works. These games are not known for their complex dungeons, intricate plots, or especially difficult battles. They're Sunday Funday affairs, the kind designed to make you feel like the good and awesome person that you are. You're smashing those wacky monsters by the thousands, crafting plans to unlock neat stuff, and enjoying a thorough introspective on the console industry and boob-jokes. That said, formulas eventually become stale. There's only so much that can be done with a concept. An injection of fresh ideas or even a change of direction is necessary to keep a game series interesting.\n\nHow does Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation accomplish this daunting task? Um... It doesn't.\n\nBut it's like I always say: When the Devil isn't in my Crystal Light, he's in the details. Nep-Cubed stays fresh not by messing with the formula, but by improving on practically every aspect. First off, let's talk about the characters. In the last game, Nepgear is a nice girl, but she was saddled with the unfortunate task of playing an everyday heroine. The Neptunia series isn't built for characters like her. So, in N3p not only do we get Neptunia being her usual absurd self, she's joined by Plutia. With this gal, it's either sleepy-time or sadomasochistic time. Nepgear returns, but she's become a trifle touched in the head, possibly due to all of the complaints about how normal and boring she was. Noire also gets main-character duty this go-around. Her personality is: "It-It's not like I want to play the straight-woman or anything!" Nearly everyone else makes an appearance in the story and/or the dozens upon dozens of optional cutscenes. Whereas Re;Birth 2 was lacking in personality, this game is practically a personality explosion.\n\nYou know what else I disliked about Neptunia 2? Being stuck with the same party-members for the vast majority of the game. R3;Birth neps that issue in the bud. As soon as chapter 1, a deluge of playable characters are dropped in your proverbial lap. These heroines also receive a new ability called "awakening". It's basically an HDD-level boost for non-CPUs/Candidates. Share-shenanigans are a thing of the past as well. Once you reach the specific point in the story, you'll unlock a character, no colosseum or quest grinding necessary.\n\nThe battle-system has received some slight revisions. The SP meter is tied into the CPU's ability to perform EXE moves. So if you perform so many special moves, or cast enough healing spells, you won't be able to perform EXEs, until you attack the enemy to rebuild the lost meter. There are also less EXE moves in general. While these changes can be considered nerfs, this attempt at balance makes the fights a little more complicated than: spam rush combos > spam EXEs > spam level-up screens. Still, unless you're actively trying to stay weak, you'll shred 90% of the enemies in this game.\n\nAnother practically life-changing improvement is the "search" function. When you can't be arsed to remember where a "magical contract" or a "magical contact" can be found, you can run an in-game search. Yes, shift+tab and the nearest FAQ in the Steam community is available, but at least it's obvious that Compile Heart cares. Stella (ugh) also makes her return. She's got a nice racket going doesn't she? Everytime she makes an appearance in a Neptunia game, the urge to buy DLC rises by 5,000,000%. This time around she's exploring a massive tower. A number of extremely useful plans are tied to this tamogotchi nightmare, so you might as well fork over that extra dollar. At least it doesn't take her 12+ hours to explore the later locations.\n\nBut you know what? One of the best qualities of R3;Birth is those times where it shows some charm. I mean, okay there's still plenty of fan-service, the plot and villains being ridiculous, and the overabundance of cute girls doing kyuuuute thangs. Somewhere underneath all of that nonsense, there are rare moments that warm the ancient & cavernous ruins I consider to be my heart. I'd be perfectly content if this series was just a farce, but it understands the right ways to capture my attention. Then again, for all I know this is just another method Nep-fever sinks it's claws into my soul. Idea Factory is making sure I stick around to buy Neptunia VII, and the musou-like hack & slash, and the Noire SRPG, and Blanc Vs Zombies, and the Sega Hard Girls cross-over...\n\nIt's questionable how long I'll be able to participate in this rodeo. The Re;Birth series always does enough to keep the players addicted, and this entry is a continuation of everything that works. If you're expecting something more, then I don't know what to tell you. You certainly can't expect to enjoy this game if the previous entries didn't grab you. However, if you're a fan, then I'm positive that this entry won't disappoint.","January 10","true","39.7"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","22","28","2","0"

O_O","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JessyWessyPuddingInPie/","189 products in account","I come in peace. Peace that I have returned to Nep Nep's dimensions from the first game with 98 hours (all achievements) and 124 hours (all achievments) from the second. Now that, the third game has finally unveiled on Steam, the nepping season has returned. To bring peace to Gameindustri and Platnium all achievements.\n\nI am currently in chapter 1 and I must say, Idea Factory and Compile Heart has never failed to impress and wow me with Neptunia games and their other titles. Even though I kind of know what's going to happen in this game due to watching the Anime Series (The anime is all 3 games combined into a whole new story).\n\nThe game has actually wowed me the minute the prologue began as Mr Narrator introduced our lovely goddess. The entire battle system layout, menus and how things are accessed have been totally revamped - it has a fresher look and feel to my eyes, as if my eyes are going to explode but in a good way *eyegasm*\n\nI undertstand how people think Neptunia games have alot of recycled monsters/maps from other games and other IF and CH titles but the game does include a fewer new maps and a more feel of exploration.\n\nPROs-\n- Our goddesses are back\n- This game features our lovely ladies, Iris Heart (Plutia) and Yellow Heart (Peashy)\n- ^ For those who have enjoyed the first game with these to as DLC characters, this is a must get if you want some more character development and know them more as characters and not OP characters.\n- New maps - one of the maps, I've encountered has stairs\n- 4 characters in the team like the last game\n- REFERENCES OF COURSE! Here's a small one - NEPULUS GRIFT 8D\n- The translation has more of a Rebirth 1 feel unlike Rebirth 2, I actually couldn't get as much humor from it (Maybe its just me)\n- 4 combos and not 3!\n- New music? There's some I've never heard before actually\n- Do you like those blocks from Mario where jump to get dah moneeyyy?  Well if you do great! Hidden items in the game aren't glowy thingies but are blocks! BUT WARNING- They might hurt your waifu... Plutia called me mean and yelled ow :V\n- Hidden treasures are easier to find, you dont need a plan like other games.\n\nCONS\n- 2 of the 3 cutscnes lagged very badly on me compared to the other games. Lagged about every few seconds but then again, I can't blame the developers at fault since my Surface Pro 3 doesn't have a high graphics card but oh well.\n\nI guess that's all I have to say really, though to some, it's not great but to some it's great but too many issues leaving to hate. Well, if you've finished and legit read this review. Purchase the game if it floats your boat! I do recommend you at least play the second game though since it's a sequel to it unlike Rebirth 1.\n\nOverall, highly neppenmend this game.","October 31, 2015","true","104.6"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","72","23","32","4","0"

The Story continues off where MK2/Re;Birth 2 left off with Neptune being sucked into the UltraDimension and meets Plutia, the extreme Sadist CPU in the 16Bit Era.\n\nThe Good;\n\nThe main story is perhaps the best out of the series, its very well told and the voice actors do a great job as usual in bringing our favorite nepneps back.   Also Re;Birth 3 improves on several features such as an improved treasure hunting system so no longer spamming 'scan' in order to find those treasure, or reloading the same dungeon over and over to find rare or important items.\n\nAlso, I think its a positive change but others may disagree, they significantly changed how the SP system works, so now everything from healing spells, to the typical EX attacks use SP instead of previous games where special attacks/healing used mana and the EX had a seperate meter, its all combined now so some battles require a bit more strategy instead of just spamming the same attacks over and over.\n\nAnother good point is the awakening system, which gives a large stat boost to non-CPU characters, along the same lines as a HDD transform.\n\nThe Bad;\n\nNow for the bad aspects,  unfortunately whilst the previous games mostly had limited bad points.  Victory//Re;Birth 3 does have several points which are quite negative and should be talked about, I will list these and explain them.\n\nUltra Extreme GrindFest (Worst in the Industry)\n\nThe developers incorporated new challenges into the game, by repeating the same process or achieving certain milestones, however they completely and honestly - went way over the top in terms of requirements for some of these,  such as jumping 10,000+ times... to unlock bonuses, I am not even kidding or lying how obnoxious some of these challenges can get,  luckily - no trophies are attached to them so for the most part, it unlocks stats/extra items or skills but still, it is way over the top considering these challenges are for each and every character in the game.\n\nAnother bad point is that the clothing has been priced far too high,  much much higher than the previous games so that all the unlockables and cute clothing are more or less a complete waste of time because by the time you've beaten the game, you'll still not be able to afford any of the clothing or accessories.  In fact,  getting money this time around is much harder than previous games.  In future games, I would like to see the clothing prices drastically reduced so that at least during the first cycle the player can at least purchase some clothing without skipping on upgraded gear.\n\nAnother minor point is a few boss fights, especially end of game have ultra cheap moves which can insta-kill and even immediately game over if your unlucky or not sufficiently levelled high enough to wipe her out in one turn.","November 5, 2015","true","41.1"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","19","25","0","0"

It will make a completionist cry.\n- New dungeon mode: Big Dungeon Mode.\n- Stella's Minigame overhauled. Now is more relevant to the main game with being a bigger source of drops and required to get more dungeons and modes unlocked.\n- in-game Nepedia makes it easier to find who drops what and where for those unlockables. Best update IMO.\n\nDissapointments- Godly/Sucky game discs are still the same from Re;birth 1.

This problem was even more serious in earlier Neptunia games. It is recommended to read the guide carefully before starting the game if you want to get as many achievements as possible. Not so much of a big deal as a disadvantage, but still, better to be aware of missable events ^^.\n\nAs I mentioned, I’m a sincere fan of this series, so I’ll try to cover as many general aspects as I can possibly think of:\n\nThis game, which can be called HDN re birth 3 (on PC) or Victory (on PS3) for short, is a tactical role-playing game in which players take control of 4 characters both in the front line and the rear line (meaning 8 in total). This makes this latest product different in a more catchy way, probably easier to get the gist of the gameplay compared to the 2 earlier Neptunia games; for new players of HDN, I suggest you to play this first (like me), because this one gives less penalty compared to the 2 earlier ones. When a character dies, for example, in HDN Victory, the system still allow switches between the K.Oed character and the rear character, while in others you need to revive the dead before doing so, also, you have all the characters from the earlier games to use, and so on…….. but don't worry, the story in this game is settled completely differently from the earlier ones, only the same characters remains\n.\nHowever, sometimes you will still face challenges, in this case, there are two ways:\nDevelop a strategy or to train characters by fighting monsters from time to time. You can slay bosses which are difficult to beat at the first encounter more easily with the 2nd solution, but in my case for example, I always try to beat the boss with strategies in spite of being difficult, which wine and dines my own tactical strategy ^^, and well, sometimes this takes time -.- .\n\nAbout the characters, well, let's say that you will never have enough with them, their cuteness is really, unbeatable (even I cannot resist >^<), in my opinion, this is a special and important feature for this series, every character is different, which is why the use of strategy becomes interesting here excluding the OPed histoire.\n\nSpeaking of items, weapons and crafts, we have an abundant amount of which in this game, this keeps leveling up the character’s ability as players upgrade their equipments while training. Crafts, which are called plans in this game, play an extremely important role in this game, some plans gives you extremely powerful weapons while others provide very useful items, many maps even require the corresponding plan to be unlocked, therefore, as far as I’m concerned, it is important to sometimes pause from advancing the storyline in order to get some plans done, this makes the gameplay a lot easier. There are different ways to get a plan done, some requires you to gather items from enemy drops, others needs you to gather ingredients in the field of a dungeon...... et cetera. Don't worry about getting bored, even exploring them can be fun ^^.\n\nSoundtracks and CGs in this game are also well done. Idea Factory, together with Compile Heart, created its own style of character’s painting design which is genuinely unique, you can’t find anime artworks with similar ingenuity of manga creation elsewhere. Soundtracks are generally a good background support to the gameplay, although I can’t think of anything extraordinary, these soundtracks are special for me personally in terms of melody, hopefully you will enjoy them as well ^^.\n\nAbout potential bugs, I don't think that I encountered more 5 bugs after 82 hours of gameplay, so for me, the gameplay is pretty solid. I'm sorry for players who often experiences crashes in game, I am not really helpful here...\n\nThank you for reading this review, I hope that this did give you a general idea on the system of the game as well as the main features. However, I have to say that even if it did, it remains only a vague introduction, there are tons and tons of things which only you can discover in this game, no descriptions can really work for HDN series. The only way to learn and have a deep understanding of it is to give it a try ^^.","April 13","true","81.9"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","3"

I previously gave it a thumbs down, and while I've changed that to a thumbs up, I wouldn't exactly 'recommend' this game.\nThe gameplay is identical to the previous two games, however there is a great deal more talking in this game, and that's saying a lot considering the amount of chit-chat the other games had to offer.\nThe characters are what really sink this game for me. They range from 'annoying' to 'insufferable' to 'I really wish this game had a Conquest ending so I could personally murder Plutia and Vert'.\nI say with absolutly no hyperbole or jest that there were many times during this game where I experienced genuine physical and mental pain. I'd have to stop playing and try to take my mind off of the game for a while before I could even consider coming back to it.\nStill, if you enjoyed the other games, you'll probably get some enjoyment out of this one. Just give some thought to buying the DLC, as that's the only way to have any of the Human/Maker characters available to use.\nI look forward to the day where we get a Neptunia game that puts less focus on these one-note CPUs, and instead puts the interesting 'side' characters in the limelight.","April 21","true","33.7"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

What took them so long to port this?! /s\n\nThe subtle changes to the system is generally good. Love it or hate it, at bare minmum it shakes up SOME of the strategy that has been recycled from both RB1 and RB2 and makes you learn and adapt new ones. The new inability to preview shop items stats without using the somewhat clunky "Equip and buy" preview menu is a slight annoyance, but other than that most of the changes to the game are positive.\nEDIT: I just forgot to mention how AWESOME the new thing that shows elemental strength/weakness is. It wasn't very intuitive in the older games, but is a godsend that saves you from endless experimenting, staring and numbers and checking wikis.\nI won't comment on pacing or plot because I haven't finished the game to comment on the former and the latter is irrelevant if you're playing a neptunia game not Re;birth 2. But yeah, save world from evil council of ominousness and incompetence or something like that.\n\nInterestingly, the intro to this game is less fanservice heavy than the other two, which I feel like it's a good thing although your mileage may vary. (It makes newer people to the series not immediately have the "oh god what am I getting into" reaction, I suppose.)\n\nAs for framerate/whatever issue that plagued RB2, I didn't have much. I mean it defaulted to my integrated card again, but that's something easily fixed, I also hit 400fps in some points which glitches various animations and speed of some transitions. This can be fixed by enabling VSync on your graphics card control panel which caps the FPS to the intended 60. (I couldn't find the config file that earlier games came with... I guess I didn't search hard enough.)\n\nAnd with that, now we wait for IF to announce Victory II on the Victory engine! *gets shot*","October 30, 2015","true","104.6"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","17","26","7","0"

However, the stories did not connect to each other.\n\nAfter I played the last two games, I like this the most because of a lot of new features that added to this game. And even more content than ever. You can easily put a lot of hours to this game. Trust me. Now lets talk about advantage and disadvantages.\n\nAdvantages:\n-+1 Combo: You can perform 5 combos right now and another EX Finishes.\n-Easier to explore Stella's Dungeon: Instead of explore the actual dungeon in Re;Birth2, this game become "Areas". One area includes a lot of items. Easier to finish. And you can deploy her while you are in dungeon too.\n-Easier to acquire plans: Plans that you will get you will find less plans because Stella will find it for you.\n-Explore the actual Nation: Instead of every nation in the same map, you have the large map that includes nations and each natio have it's own map.\n-More dungeons than ever: Means you can grind easier.\n-Leader effect: You will get bonus stats based on what character is the leader.\n-Better looking menu: Why I frogot about this. It's easier to understand.\n\nDisadvantages:\n-Some crashes and framerate drops: Still better than the second game. But in first game I got zero crashes and framerate drops. Especially wheh I fight the CPUs I got bad framerate drops. Even I have an awesome rig.\n-Grinding like the previous games: The way Neptunia was meant to be played.\n-More useless plans: You know what, I hate this. More features and also more useless plans. The +1 combo I said above should use plans...... for each character.  Leader effect I also said above should use plans too. No individual EXE Skills, only the couple and frontline EXE Skills was given through the story. Why? BECAUSE YOU NEED A F*CKING PLAN TO UNLOCK FOR EACH CHARACTER. F*CK THIS.\n-Now SP and EXE Drive gauge become one: Means hitting enemies refils SP gauge because they remove the actual EXE Drive Gauge. Means Ex finishers based on the amount of SP you have, EXE Skills consumes SP(1SP bar means 250 SP=1EXE for previous games).Many like it. But I don't.\n\nOverall: This game is superior to the first two games(Oh and also U. forget about it, hugely lack of content). This game has a lot of content that you can't get enough.

Dont get me wrong i have nothing against grinding but as someone who always wants to 100% a game this seems way to much, gets boring and is really just a cheap way to make the game last longer.\n\nFor Neptunia fans and people who dont care having everything in the game buy it for people who want everything get ready for the struggle","April 15","true","89.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

While i have a small amount of time invested in the steam version i still can recognise that they are very similar.\n\nSo this is a sort of rebrand of reinvisin of hyperdimension victory which is regarded as the best of them. Its loosely regarded as the sequal to Mk2 or rebirth2 however you can start here and you will be fine. Honestly you can start on any of the hyperdimension games and it really wouldnt matter.\n\nAnyways this one has a lot of the similar features that you would find in the other games however there is a notable quality upgrade, all of the graphics are improved, the polys are notiably higher(aliasing is still crap) and the menus work effectively best of all the game is stable once again unless you are on intel hd 2000 or less it seems.\n\nAs always the game is hilarious and a bit over cutsy, combat is extremely addictive hence the massive success of the series and all of the partical effects seem to have been redone to be at 60fps(previously some animations ran slower then the realtime rendering and it was wierd) and to just look better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/provoltion/recommended/353270/","provoltion","Provoltion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/provoltion/","65 products in account","So I've been playing this for a while and decided to do a detailed review for this game. (Since I can't make a funny one, hehe)\n\nI played Re;birth1 and Re;birth2, simply put Re;birth3 is by far the best one in terms of everything. Unlike Re;birth2 that almost feels like the exact same Re;birth1 but played with other characters (the CPU Candidates), Re;birth3 has quite different features than the other two such as a slightly different battle system, different dungeon hidden treasure, different GUI, different World Map, and etc.\n\nThough it is better than the previous games, Re;birth3 is back to having that same game design flaw with Re;birth1 that is having less party slot from the total of main characters. Re;birth1 mistake is that you only have 3 character slots while having 4 CPU goddesses, meaning you have to leave out 1 unfortunate CPU goddess in your party. Re;birth2 fixed this with having 4 slots for 4 CPU Candidates. But Re;birth3, while you now have 4 slots, the number of main CPU goddess is now 5 (or 6 if you want to count in Peashy). Yes, this isn't gameplay wise, but having to leave out one main character is painful.\n\nAnother problem that I have with the game, though not fatal but still bugs me, is how the optional events works for DLC characters, I won't spoil the content of the event and which one, but just expect a chronological order failure with it. In other words, the DLC events is not in sync with the main storyline.\n\nRe;birth3 is back with CPUs as main protagonists, but with Noire, Blanc, and Vert have a slightly different personality as this game takes place in a different dimension from the previous game (while still being a direct sequel of Re;birth2). So have fun with Neptune being Neptune, Noire's arrogant tsundere, Blanc's raging attitude, and the now keep bragging about her chest, Vert. To make things better, Re;birth3 is introducing a new main character named Plutia, which personally I find it the best one from the five, play the game if you want to know why.\n\nI haven't finish the whole game, but it seems the game is no longer shares-based, which might be nice to some of you that gets really really bored doing quests to control shares to aim for a specific ending like Re;birth2. Interestingly, Neptune comments about this in the game.\n\nThe game has a new optional feature called Challenges that basically an in-game achievements that grants additional bonuses or a Plan on completing it, for instance, jump 100 times and you get a permanent stat bonus. Though, it's too bad that the challenges are not global but attached to a single character, so you have a same bunch of the achievements that progress individually for each of the characters in the game.\n\nPlans is more neat now, as you no longer have that annoyingly item change and add enemies plans from ciphers each time a new dungeon pop up. And the dungeon change is simplified for the greater good as it is basically only change the boss monster in the dungeon, making you easier to remember where to get material items since the regular monsters stays the same.\n\nStella Dungeon mini game from Re;birth2 is back although slightly different than the previous one. But worry not as the changes is for the better, you can access Stella's Dungeon in the menu now which is very very nice, and I think it is generally takes a much less time than Re;birth2 one, especially if you buy the DLC that made the floor search only takes 1 second to complete which make 100 floors Area only takes 1 minute and 40 seconds to complete.\n\nConclusion is that Re;birth3 is the best Neptunia Re;birth series ever made. I'll happily recommend this game to someone, though it is hard to recommend this without recommend them the previous games, especially Re;birth2 since the game is often referencing the events of Re;birth2 although not really a big deal to the game's storyline.\n\nO yeah, I forgot to mention that this game is more HD than the previous games.","November 3, 2015","true","92.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/recommended/353270/","vallinek","Vallinek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/","82 products in account","Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3: V Generation is a remake of a 2012 RPG game released on the PS3, and a sequel to the second Re;Birth game. Originally on PS Vita game, it was later ported to the PC and released on Steam.\n\nJust like with the previous two games, it's a unique take on the idea of "Console Wars" with every console being anthropomorphised into a "Goddess". Being a direct sequel to Re;Birth2, it takes place a few years after defeating the Deity of Sin once and for all. Everything returned to normal, and peace ruled over the world, but something bad is happening again and confused Neptune is thrust into a completely different dimension set in the past / alternate reality where she'll meet the predeccessor who founded Planeptune, Plutia, as well as different versions of the characters from her home world, and will have to figure out who's behind her dimension traveling, as well as stand against the local threat - the Seven Sages, opposing the Goddesses and their newly-found nations.\n\nThe gameplay is basically your typical turn-based jRPG with minor tactical elements. Your characters and enemies take turns performing attacks, using abilities or items. It's rather simple to get a grasp if you played any other turn-based RPG. Outside of dungeon exploring and fighting, you can use shops, view the gallery, accept and complete quests, or use special "Plans" to add or modify existing content in the game. The difficulty feels just right - it's not as hard as old-school jRPGs, but also not easy enough that you will be bored (unless you specifically overlevel your characters for the upcoming fights). The game even hands you certain Plans that make the enemies tougher or easier, so there's always some way of tuning the difficulty a bit if you want a challenge or - the opposite - want to focus on the story. Majority of the content is grind-based, however, so if you care about exploring everything, you'll have to level up your characters quite a lot. That being said, the general progression has been improved upon in comparison to the first two Re;Birth games - you don't have to grind nearly as much to get past certain boss fights. Also, there is an actual post-game now, and even some bonus storylines and events if you get the True Ending.\n\nAnother thing to mention is that while the previous Re;Birth games on Steam had some minor performance issues and crashes, this one runs very smoothly, and never crashed once for me. It shows that Idea Factory knows how to make a solid PC port.\n\nThe story is quite engaging, with you traveling across the alternate Gamindustri, making friends with the alternate versions of past characters and fighting against the common threat, interspersed with jokes about gaming cliches, breaking the fourth wall, and all sorts of humor. Of course, it's full of fanservice in one way or another, but what would you expect from a game that creates Moe Anthropomorphisms of game consoles?\n\nThe graphics are good. You might notice blurred textures here and there, but it's nothing big, and it's pretty to look at, especially that the general quality was noticeably improved in comparison to the past games. The only reason you might not like it is if you don't like anime style.\n\nIn the sound department, we get mostly electronic music or rock, with quite a lot memorable or downright awesome themes. It's definitely worth listening to even outside the game. An interesting thing to note is that Nobuo Uematsu, the composer for Final Fantasy, worked on some of the tracks in the game.\n\nAs far as the DLC goes... there is only one. Well, technically more, but Idea Factory performed an awesome move and decided to include all the DLC characters and Additional Content Packs, so by purchasing the game you automatically have access to 15+ bonus party members and level cap 999, as well as all the extra Colliseum fights and dungeons. The only one that doesn't come with the game helps you level up faster and makes the optional Stella's Dungeon minigame a lot easier and faster, neither of which feel neccessary.\n\nThe game also pretty much requires New Game+ in order to unlock everything, since one playthrough does not yield enough MB (Megami Bytes) to craft every Plan you can get.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, featuring adorable, likeable characters, nice graphics, great music, interesting storyline, as well as lots of humor and content. I heavily recommend it to anyone who likes jRPGs that don't take themselves too seriously or cutesy games.","January 5","true","119.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

In this land, which has nearly been demolished in the Console Wars before threatening the balance between its rulers where an empty headed girl finds herself teleported to another dimension and now has to deal with the surprises coming from this situation while trying to find a way back to her own.\n\nEven before the game itself begins, its picture on the store page and the opening animation after launching it already suggests that this game is going to be amazing, with the graphics coming into view next that shows the places waiting to be explored as the events of RB3 slowly begin to unfold. In that, the world map is visibly nicer to look at, with parts of the continent made separate instances so each would be much more detailed which makes it easy to navigate and even enjoyable to look at. Its dungeon mode and the combat taking place there are also pretty well made with the bigger moves being really flashy and the more basic ones being less so, but still interesting. The only gripe there is some of the underground caves being so dark, it makes treasure hunting very difficult without plans to help with.\nThere's also the story mode view which brings back many of the familiar places but with a new look, presenting various beautifully made landscape with Easter-style corridors, skyscrapers in the distance and many others, all of which make for an unusual but entertaining set. The character designs are also looking great with bringing back the old look of gals which were better in the first game and keeping the rest, while the new ones might be even better in appearance.\n\nIt also has a pretty great soundtrack with familiar songs returning that reall set the atmosphere, mostly the ones played during bossfights or in dungeons when fighting a harder monster. These pieces of musical arts make otherwise not too challenging battles awesome moments and one can't help, but seek them out to listen to these even a few more times. There's also the possibility to change them if one wishes to by completing plans, though since there are only very few of these and some of them don't fit the place where they can be heard, they aren't necessarily bringing the desired effect. Voice acting is also excellent with great performance from most actors, but even then, Plutia's is still really annoying which is not that nice since those playing will get to hear her a lot.\n\nStill, even though these elements offer an incredible experience by themselves, so does the gameplay in this release. Our beloved dungeons make a comeback from the first installment with much the same layout which is helpful since it's easy directions this way, but this also brings some interesting changes. One being that finding hidden items is no longer achieved by spamming the radar once we begin exploring, but rather all spots are visible only the special ones being invisible while casting a shadow on the ground, and by jumping in the right place reveals them some coins and sometimes other stuff, but thankfully there aren't any items there which one has to scour the whole place for by visiting every blocks on the map. It is also possible now to find the location of materials needed for anything in the Remake interface, which is very helpful since you don't have to find everything all over the place anymore, so excellent moves here.\nThere have been significant changes to combat as well in the way that the developers cut the EXE Drive gauge out since everybody just spammed them to obliterate everything that happens to be in the area, so now they are tied to the SP meter depleting the vast majority of it after a single discharge. While this does make fights a little more tactical, it also sorta backfires sadly, because changing to HDD forms alone drains a portion of it already, and using their strongest attack takes away the rest, forcing the party members to spam rush attacks refill it or use less effective SP moves which often still require a lot. As such, this design was not quite the most agreeable way to make combat more exciting unfortunately.\nThis becomes even more pronounced with the introducing of challenges which are not unlike the ones one could see in Fairy Fencer F. Problem is, said successor of the EXE Drive is only unlocked through a plan for each character separately a milestone is reached in one, so the player is practically forced to play only a few girls, or they won't be able to reap the benefits they need. Not only that, this quickly becomes increasingly tedious as the next step in these require to repeat the same action impossible amount of times no sane person would bother to waste time on especially the last one, so while it sounds great at first its implementation is anything but satisfactiory. Therefore, only a few are actually worth to get like the fifth atrike slot in a combo or the flashiest skills you can get from there.\nOn the other hand Stella's Dungeon also returns but this times much more nicely with the adjustments to its design, mainly in the interface that is much easier to use now but also with other features like the option to pick a scout and also useful abilities that greatly increase her survivalibility as ashe ascends the floors of the tower in front of her. it is also the only way to acquire many plans for the Remake system with ingredients for stuff as a side benefit, so it's highly recommended to be used with a related DLC reducing risks and time sinking a lot as well.\n\nSurprisingly enough the translation quality has also become a lot better with miswording so badly that I would fire the idiot who rewrote and not actually translated the original script being much rarer now, and while the destruction of cultural aspects like Nepgear-chan butchered into Nep Jr. is still difficult to accept, it finally reached a point where it's on a more tolerable level. It's kind of eyebrow raising when someone who never studied Japanese language in a language course could translate lines better than a guy who gets paid for that. Seriously.\nAnd while it's not such an important issue one might find it amusing in the storyline that having different time speed is impossible since the characters wouldn't be able to communicate then. It'd create a phenomenon not unlike in a Stargate episode where time went so slowly it cancelled out any kind of way to contact others from the outside. It is most definitely a plothole, but on the other hand, it was never mean to be accurate in terms of physics.\nOn the other hand, Plutia's simply the worst since her aything but likeable and borderline antagonistic behavior ruins many of the otherwise enjoyable scenes which clearly shows how she should be an enemy, not ally. This is a very big demerit since anybody who isn't into that kind of messed up character will find her less than agreeable, yet we're forced to watch the stunts she pulls out of her rear end, especially as the events progress.\n\nWhile this game still has its share of inconsistencies and flaws however both inherently and through localization, after the massive trainwreck of the second installment in this series liked only by the mindless sheeple who outright ignored every single flaw it had no matter how glaring, it was a pleasant turn seeing how this release was made so much more enjoyable. Following the best traits of the previous ones while fine tuning the gameplay now makes for an even more amazing experience which doesn't happen often in sequels.

For one, most of the DLC is already in the game so you don't need a lot of extra cash for more content.  I like the character outfits in this game more than Re;Birth1.  The story is much of the same; humorous, silly, and with plenty of video game and movie references.  Which can be the game's biggest issue if you don't get the references, since Re;Birth3 is mostly story.  Why is this a problem?  Well the game play is simplistic.  Don't get me wrong, I love Nep-Nep, but the game play could be deeper.  That being said, what's there is sufficient and isn't bad by any means (I've seen worse).\n\nBuy this game if you want to get into this series and don't worry about it being the 3rd in the series.  Some of the characters will fill you in at a few points if you missed anything.  They're not detailed recaps, but hey they didn't have to do that.\n\nSo yeah, get this game over the other two, but the others are just as good, so get them later! :p","November 1, 2015","true","9.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

Wrong game.\nPardon me. However, I must say this. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;birth3 V Generation just might be the best entry in the series so far.\nYou will laugh at the game's incredible amounts of humour and even the running gags.\nThe game's new SP system takes a lot getting used to, but the much cheaper SP Skills and various combo stringings can help you get the edge on the new system.\nThis might also be the hardest entry in the series. Even after reaching a high level, and using the Free DLC characters, it can take a while before you can pummel the "Tough Enemies" down. On the bright side, I only have to do loads of grinding in order to obtain the strongest weapons.\nIn the end, V Generation is a victorious entry in the series.

However at the time of this writing:\n\n~Only 80% of the playerbase chose to start the game.\n~Only 52% of the playerbase completed the prologue chapter.\n~Only 47% of the playerbase completed the first chapter.\n~Only 37% finished the second chapter.\n\n~Less than 5% of the playerbase had the resolve and endurance to finish the game and actually see the ending(s).\n\nIf one knows a little bit of math, one can say that out of the people who actually have played the game (80%), of that total population....we can write 52/.8 = 65. Basically two thirds of those who started the game went through the prologue chapter at most. However, when the math is applied....by the end of Chapter 2, less than half of the people who actually started the game) actually remained playing the game passed the second chapter.\n\nThe game is really for the playerbase who actually likes a combination of Visual Novels mixed with RPG interfaces in its own game. I love the game for its humor in a time where most games are super-serious and humorless, but even I admit that when I started the game to show my fiancee how the game started...it took an hour to go through the prologue chapter because most of it were the two of us reading it.\n\nI am currently going through the New Game+ attempting to get the TRUE ENDING after getting the Good Ending. :) I am one of the few who actually went through the entire game ;)\n\nGet this game if you have the patience to read a ton for a lighthearted, lukewarm story :) This game reminds me of games like Xenogears that beat out final fantasy in acquiring the award for "most ridiculous amount of text" in a scene. :)","November 16, 2015","true","66.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

I got stuck in one of the chapters in re;b1 when I was unable to beat a boss who was miles, miles ahead of me and didn't really feel like grinding it out.... the dlc with super exp boost ensures you're always at a decent level to proceed in the story (since this game has the best story out of the franchise so far in my opinion, having seen videos of re;b2).\n\nThis time around it feels like Plutia is the main character, moreso than nep, since you can almost guarantee her appearance in nearly every scene after she's in your party, and she's by far my favorite character, ditsy and a bit lazy, and in her HDD a total 180° as she turns insanely sadistic and nigh impossible to please, almost anti hero... but still really cares for her friends, willing to do anything to protect them.. even from themselves(which causes a bit of trouble).\n\nAnyways, if you like the neptunia franchise, this is a must have!\n\nV Generation > Re;Birth 1 > Sister's Generation","December 3, 2015","true","22.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The combat system isn't incredibly deep, but it works and is fun enough (though I still feel the Break chain of attacks is relatively useless). HDD attacks feel a bit more balanced and not nearly as broken as in Rebirth 1.\n\nStory wise, though the Neptunia games have never had strong stories, but this one feels the best to me. It follows Nep as she is transported to another dimension, the world of the 1980's game industry, which is a novel idea and leads to fun geeky jokes about the era. The characters have always been what drives the Neptunia games, and this one brings back nearly every previous character in some form, which I adore.\n\nI found the game relatively easy for most of the main story, but that post game content, dungeons, and Colliusum battles require strategy and will kick your ♥♥♥ if you aren't prepared, which I really like. It's an appreciated difficulty bump for more hardcore players.\n\nIf I had complaints, the biggest one is the continued recycling of dungeons and enviroments. There are only a handful of dungeon layouts, and "new" dungeons are simply old ones with a new enemy coat. This was a problem in Rebirth 1 and 2 and it's a bit irritating it coninues here. The required amount of level grinding is also very grating.\n\nBut overall, Rebirth 3 is my favorite of the Rebirth games and I don't regret putting in the time. Had a lot of fun!

I only have a small handfull of things to pick with this game:\n\n1. The contents of hidden treasures are too rare. To obtain Vert's School Uniform outfit, took me 56 attempts. For Noire, Uni, Nepgear and Neptune's idol outfits, it took more that 347 attempts in total. (Yes I actually kept a tally as I went)\n\n2. There are waaaaaaaaaaay too many Chirper events that are not necessary to the plot advancement, and  do not give you any items, which leads a lot of people to miss the missable chirper events, so they have to play the whole story out a 2nd or even a 3rd time.\n\n3. A few FPS issues. Framerate drops exponentially when a dungeon first loads up, and even though activating HDD is faster overall, battle scenes take longer to load than necessary\n\n4. The Chiba characters that pop up on chirper events are always really jittery. I've been told that this can be fixed by modifying your .exe file so that the game has more allocated RAM. (If that's the case then that's some poor coding done by IF) I haven't tried it myself since I'm no expert in that field\n\n5. Jumping is very glitchy on occasion. (regardless of whether you have the Jumping Star plan active or not) Sometimes when jumping underneath a hidden treasure, it does not trigger the hidden box, and sometimes when jumping in general, the player Y coordinate movement becomes extremely jittery.\n\nAlso this game has plenty of FanService moments in it, in case you're one of... those people... and they use the word 'conjecture' ALOT.\n\nOther than that, great game ^-^ The graphics are beatiful, a massive improvement over the previous 2 games, and the Guard Break Lag glitch that existed in Re;Birth2 is mercifully gone c:","December 14, 2015","true","134.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU HAVE YET TO PLAY THIS GAME AS WELL AS RE;BIRTH 1 & 2.\n\nNow, just a disclaimer, I have yet to complete the game, so I am only explaining what I have experienced throughout my total playtime.\n\nOkay, now that that's outta the way, I shall review this game.\n\nWhat I like about the game is;\nTons of humor.\n\nVery good graphics.\n\nThe customisation of characters.\n\n"Stella's Dungeon", a so called "mini-game" that helps you grind for items in real-time.\n\nPlutia, or rather the sadistic "Iris Heart".\nPersonally, I don't find anything I dislike about the game, besides the fact that it's a little difficult to fight the "Tough Enemies" early on, as you don't have much in game currency, or credits to purchase better weapons. Other than that, everything else is fine.\n\nThe reason why I stated, "DO NOT CONTINUE READING IF YOU HAVE YET TO PLAY THIS GAME AS WELL AS RE;BIRTH 1 & 2.", is because they are all linked. In certain dialogues, they will mention things like, "...from the previous game...", etc. "Stella's Dungeon" was brought into Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation, which previously was introduced in Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2 Sisters Generation. So there's that.\n\n10/10 Would repeat the scene where Noire was "lectured" by Iris Heart.\n\nThat is all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TriDaTrii/recommended/353270/","TriDaTrii","Compa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TriDaTrii/","20 products in account","Neptunia Re;Birth 3\nThis game is a great one. I've played all three Re;Birhths(Which are remakes of the original Neptunia, Neptunia MK2, as well as Neptunia Victory). Although, I kind of regret playing Re;Brith 2. Stay away from that if you can.\n\nCharacters and Story\nStory wise, this game does not follow after Neptunia Re;birth 1, but it does chronologically take place after the events within Neptunia Re;Birth 2. Re;birth 3 begins with the 4 goddesses, Neptune(Nepu Nepu), Noire, Blanc, and Vert playing a game. As they decide to team on Nepu Nepu to have a greater chance of winning, the game "breaks". Nepgear, Neptune's sister, takes this moment to test out her new "N-gear"(I think that's what it was called), and she tests it upon Neptune so Nepu Nepu can dive into the game and see what is causing the game to be so bugged out. Eventually, after being ratted out for being so lazy dispite being the Goddess of a Nation, Nepu Nepu is forced to go do work for once. How could someone be so mean to my Nepu Nepu!? Anyways, Neptune ends up running into someone and she is then sent to a different dimension where she thinks all is the same, but it's not.\n\nCharacter wise, I love every single one of them. With the exception of Uni. Uni is a bland, over the top Tsundere.(Noire is a better Tsundere) Neptune is the goddess of Planeptu- I bit my toungue -_- She usually likes to break the 4th wall constantly and she's pretty lazy compared to the hard working tsundere, Noire. Now Noire is the goddess of Lastation and is your typical tsundere. She has a hard time being true about her feelings and Neptune is usually the one to put her in that spot. She's probably my 3rd or 4th favorite character. Vert is the goddess of Leanbox. Vert generally acts like a princess. She has that look, AND that chest to fit the type too. Blanc is the goddess of Lowee. She is the quiet, "I'm going to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of you if you make fun of my chest" kind of girl. She's generally like that through out the game.(Though it's pretty funny when Vert constantly teases her about it)\n\nI've only talked about the four main goddesses because I don't want to go into the 20+ playable characters avalible for your pleasure.(Broccoli, Tekken, Mages, and Marvelous AQL are my favorites).\n\nBattle System\nNow the battle system is an updated version of the combat system used in the orginal "Hyperdimension Neptunia Victory" and is combination of Breath of Fire V's and Persona's battle system. You go into dungeons and monsters or enemies are placed in certain parts of the dungeon. Now if you strike the enemy before they attack you, you are granted the first turn. This is called a "symbol attack". If the enemy attacks you first, they get the first turn. When you attack an enemy, you have addition attacks to perform. Those being rush, power, and guard attacks. Not only that, but you can swap partners, change forms(non goddesses can only "awaken"), use items, as well as skills. When you are facing an enemy, they have two bars. One for health, one for their "guard". Take out their guard points using "guard" attacks and you are granted the ability to inflict a larger ammount of damage on the enemy. They can regenerate this bar each turn though. Now like Re;Birth 2's combat system, and unlike Re;Birth 1's, you can use 4 party members. The bonus in this game's new battle system, is the ability to use 5 combos, as opposed to 4 in the previous games. Don't let this fool you. Each characters 5th combo slot have to be unlocked via the "remake system" and only certain characters can have a 5th combo slot for the earlier mentioned forms of attack.\n\nI really like the battle system because you have to choose which attacks to use against which enemies and when you use them. An example is trying to use your high costing skills on an enemy who's guard points have not been lowered. This is a stupid idea as you will not do as much damage as if the enemy didn't have any guard. Overall, newcomers will find this battle system difficult for the first 10 minutes of game play. After that, you'll be breezing through it like Nepu Nepu does with her puddings.\n\nGameplay\nRe;Birth 3 features the same map/area mechanics as the previous games. Every area/dungeon is placed on a map. You select the area and are teleported to the corresponding dungeon. A menu opens up if you click on one of the major locations such as Planeptu, I bit my toungue again -_-, Lastation, Leanbox, and Lowee. The menu that opens up allows you to access the shop, museum, Nepstation, as well as the guild. The shop is where you would buy usable, or equipable items. The museum is where you view past cutscenes, unlockable images, as well as soundtracks that are unlocked with the game's progression. The Nepstation is only avalible in Planep- I'm not biting my toungue again... The Nepstation is a bit unique. Each time you visit the Nepstation, you view an event. Now the even is where you either take a "one million Nep quiz", get certain items at discount prices, or to see some extra bit of dialogue. The guild is where you can take up quests, and complete them to earn small rewards. Some quests will have to be completed to progess the game. Every quest has a certain symbol or lettering next to them. This determines whether or not you can repeat them, or if they are story related.\n\nOne major aspect of this game, is the "remake system". Through out the game find "plans". Plans are used to alter dungeons, add certain bonus's to your characters, and to add items to the shop. To put these plans in effect, you need to get yourself some of Nepu Nepu's pudding. You actually need to get yourself some "memory". Memory increases are found at certain points in the game. One more major thing to put plans into effect, is materials you find from enemies. Most basic plans will only require low tier monster drops where as more advanced plans require drops from even certain bosses. Don't expect to be able to craft every single plan because you'll never be able to with the limited ammount of memory. You also won't be able to because you're only on your first play through of the game. Which is what I'm about to go into right now.\n\nWhen you complete a single player game, you're done, that's it. When playing Re;Birth 3, you are able to play "new game plus". Nothing new really happens in new game plus, but you are given more memory with the story quests and events that you come accros in the previous run through of the game. New game plus doens't offer you any new material except for the "good ending" and the "true ending". These can both be done without going into new game plus but you would have to create whole different saves. The reason you would want to do this in new game plus is your character data and items carry over. Got a level 100 Nepu Nepu and a swimsuit but you want to redo the game to get the true ending? Don't worry, new game plus has your back with it's ability to carry over data.\n\nAchievements\nThe achievements in this game aren't too difficult to get, but they require some grinding to do. You'll find yourself getting half of them by just playing the game, but there are some where they require you to do major grinding like the "lovable achievements". There's not much to talk about the achievements so I'll just end it here.\n\nAfter thoughs\nIn the end, was this game worth the $30(31 with DLC)? To me, yes. There's quite a lot to do and it can keep even hard core grinders busy for several hours. I would aim for this game on sale though since it's just SO GOOD for just $12. I totally didn't buy it on sale... Anyways, this game offeres lovable characters, great 4th wall breaking events, as well as relaxing gameplay that the $15 CS:GO would never do.\n\n10/10 would recommend with Nepu Nepu and her puddings again!","February 5","true","93.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As far as game difficulty goes its in between the first and second one, the first Re:birth being the hardest and the second being the easiest.\nThe easiest point of this game is the shear number of characters you get though DLC (which appears be to DLC mostly if you have saves from the previous games rather then buying) outside of the DLC characters it has the smallest cast of playable characters being only the CPU's, (so take it as you want on the DLC characters being bad by making it easier or good to make up for the lack of characters).\nCombat system is the same as the previous two with a few diffrences, first off collusium battles are easier now with the monsters being less OP, second off you are given the option of switching KO'd character with there back character, and third, the EX system of the game for combat has been drastly changed, rahter then a shared EX gadge that is shared by the party it is based on the individual characters SP, alsong with those changes SP regenerates a little per hit and all characters have there SP locked at 1000 (no increasing it this game). Along that some line of though I want to add this means you can't spam HDD all the time, your SP doesn't recover when you leave a dungeon, it only recovers from battle or items, but a small plusside (for the DLC characters at least) everyone has an HDD action, or rather none CPU's have Awakening, more or less a super sayain golden aura with boosted stats.\nMusic is still more or less the same with a few plans that can let you change the music (but only the default or a single alt.)\nAnother new addition (Which can be really annoying if your a completionist) is a challange system, basicly you do something a number of times and you unlock stuff (mostly small stat ups with the final level of the challanges being a large stat up, but also some plans), the ploblem here is that some of these are beyond annoying such as one challange where you have to run away from battle, the final level of the being run away from battle 3000 times (and again just one of several) and also it only applies to the active characters (meaning for the one were you have to walk around the map for so many meters you have to do with ALL the characters to competly complete it).\nStory wise you'll see a lot of similarity between the anime version with some base setting from the second game (and somehow a lot of refrensing to the first). The story was good and had a lot of good build-up with a bit of acualy game history in it (you'll more or less see the game industries history be built up and refrenced a lot, specially with processors for the CPU you unlock frequently at the start of new chapters). Fans of the series most likly already know that Plutia is a main character so lots of great stuff to expect (Including a priceless scene between Iris Heart, IF, and Arfoir).\nOverall tone of the game feels more like the first one with the more wacky and sillyness that you've come to love (or might come to love) from the series and managing to mix in nicely a somewhat serious tone channeling more of the same feel with the first Re:birth but with a lot more fourth wall breaking in this, to a point where even some of the villians do it.\nOverall if your a fan of the neptunia series, or wanting to play a less intensive/serious RPG this is a good game to get and unlike the second Re:birth without any major game breaking DLC (except an experience booster plan but easy enough to ignore)","April 15","true","71.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Also, by default I am not really a big fan of RPG games to begin with, so for me this is the best kind of RPGs I've played so far. Anyway, here's my 2 cents...\n\nHere's my first impression of the game so far. I think the game is very good. Its your typical JRPG turn based combat, but I like the laidback story, level and character design, etc. It is also filled with constant references and fourth wall breaking, which I find amusing.\n\nI haven't gone that deep yet in the game so I am still unsure what other new features they have introduced, but so far nothing much have changed since Rebirth 1 and 2.\n\nAnyway, I higly recommend you get this game especially if you like the artwork, animes, JRPG. You will not be disappointed. Not to mention you will get DLC content bundled in for such a good price.\n\nThese games will forever have my support. I hope they continue porting these kinds of games. I am gonna buy them all.","October 31, 2015","true","2.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Didymuss/recommended/353270/","Didymuss","Didymuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Didymuss/","194 products in account","Once again, I have left writing this review for far too longIronically, like my review of Neptunia 2, which was quite delayed, I am once again going to be reviewing Neptunia 3 mostly as a sequel, though I shall also try my best to review Neptunia 3 as it's own game, also akin to my review of Neptunia 2.\n\nIs it the best game ever?\nNah, still Valkyrie Profile. I doubt anything will change this fact for a long time.\n\nBut is it a good game?\nDefinitely. Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 Victory Generation is a brilliant game and well worth playing if you're even remotely tempted.\n\nI'm still lazy, and writing Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 Victory Generation everytime I wish to refer to the game is arduous and word count consuming, so Neptunia 3 it shall be.\n\nSo, what's new?\nWell, not alot, really.\n\nTo my knowledge, Neptunia V was the first in the series to use the current "freeish movement" battle format that has been used in the rereleases, the Re;birth series, so while a slightly updated rerelease of V nicely rounds out the first three games of the series, it does feel a little silly.\n\nNot that I care, I'm not buying a Ps3 just for Neptune. (I totally would, though).\n\nThat being said, the Re;birth series did also port Neptunia to the Vita and consequently, the PC.\n\nWhile I stand by my statement of "not alot, really", this isn't necessarily a bad thing. The format of the game they have works, can be quick for that post-story grinding and doesn't feel like a chore when you're near the end. It's good.\n\nSo, Tom, what is new? Tell us properly this time.\nOk, alright, I'm sorry.\n\nThe story is new, obviously. It's quite good, as well. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though in my opinion the story of Neptunia 1 is better, the story of Neptunia 3 is still very good, if not a little better in some aspects. With a new story comes new characters. Some are "new", while others are actually totally new. Plutia, Lady Iris Heart, is fantastic and shall hopefully be a staple character in the future games (She's not in VII ;<).\n\nWith a new story, we get a new dimension, but unlike Neptunia 2 to Neptunia 1, Neptunia 3 is set in the same universe as Neptunia 2, and is a direct sequel to it. This new dimension is effectively gaming in the late 1980's and early 90's, and it's awesome. Fun fact, this makes some of the characters in it older than my glorious self.\n\nChallenges have been lifted borrowed from Fairy Fencer F, and a little character scaling has been adapted into them. While they don't really do anything important, some of the challenges grant very nice and useful things if you manage to finish them off, but this may take a while.\n\nNeptunia 3 is also the first in the series to use in game cutscenes, albeit very few. They are enjoyable, and a nice break from Visual Novel presentation.\n\nNepstation! I almost forgot Nepstation. A mock TV show that is inbetween chapters and separate to the plot. 'Tis a fun little breather as well as having extra stuff to do and win.\n\nSo, what returns?\nNeptune, obviously, as does her sister and all of the other main cast. A good chunk of side characters also make an appearance but the Oracles are on holiday, or something.\n\nStella's Dungeon also makes a return; it's bigger and better and less invoking of your ire if you have any plans to 100% the game's achievements. Doing so will still take a great amount of time, however, and I personally cannot be arsed with that. Despite the length that Stella's dungeon lasts, it always gives you useful things and also gives you some key things, such as Plans for increasing combos.\n\nOther than that, alot of what you will expect from Neptunia returns. The game still retains it's humour, BAMs, optional dungeons, post game content and a large amount of attire for the girls.\n\nYou know what else returns? THE SOUND SETTINGS DEFAULT TO MAX. STOP THIS.\nThey did stop it, finally, in Neptunia VII. They only default to ~35%. Wonderful.\n\nSo what about that port?\nThere's... actually extremely little to say here that wasn't already said for Neptunia 2. As aforementioned, sounds still default to max, but other than one seemingly rare game breaking bug that I had, which can be fixed with a little help from Google (I don't know if the developers have fixed it officially at this point), there's nothing new or different.\n\nTo be fair, this is a good thing as the port quality of the previous two games was pretty solid and this is no different.\n\nSo, what else?\nAs with Neptunia 2 to Neptunia 1, all the dungeons and so on look nicer, there's some newer enemies here and there, while the UI and menus all look better and more streamlined.\n\nThe resource management has been rearranged a bit; the EXE drive is taking a break for this installment and the mana has been standardised to 1000 at all levels. I like this, skills no longer cost disproportionately high amounts of mana early on, and mana potions are now worthwhile past Chapter 2. Mana also regerates a little between turns, I believe.\n\nThe Mana is divided into four chunks, and special moves now use up to all four of those 250 mana chunks to cast, further providing relevance for mana potions. Sadly, nothing else has been rescaled,  combat-wise, so Formation and Coupling Skills are still fairly redundant, the tier 2 super moves are still generally the best, while the AoE supers are still blatantly the strongest. That and Neptunia still doesn't have a worthwhile final Power attack, though she does feel a little stronger.\n\nOverall\nMuch like with the rest of the Neptunia series, I'd happily pay full price for Neptunia 3 and enjoy it for what some may say is too long. As it happens, I once again bought the game on release sale for £13, Yay sales.\n\nI love this series, and as such, have since bought and played alot of the new Neptunia VII on the PS4 which is amazing. That does mean that I'm unlikely to grant you with another Magnum Opus review for a while, but I'm afraid we shall all have to deal with it.\n\nAlso, it must suck to be in your older sister's shadow. Especially when your older sister is so utterly perfect and amazing and there is now twice as much perfection for you to compete with.","March 11","true","80.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can safly say i am a fan of nep nep.\n\nThough there are some cons with this game sady i will get to those in a minute\n\n\npros\n. A much better port then the first two game i noticed no frame loss what so ever\n. Everything feels improoved upon and better executed\n. New menu layout took some time to get used to but once i did its a lot better then the old one I hear some people don't like the change\n.Getting to level 99 seemed easy in this game.\n\ncons\n. I do not like the sp change ... you need to attack enemies to gain sp instead of having a set ammount and the cap for sp is 1000 which is stupid it really limits you on what you can do. There are sp healing items but you get those later on in the game.\n\n. reused areas ..... seriously it felt like i went through the same area 3 times but with a different name attached to it and the treasure placement was different and of course different enemies . Come on guys ...\n\n. Near the end of the game i just skipped most of the story while still knowing what was going on to many side event things as well. I skipped most if not all of those\n\n\nI really hope that megadimension neptunia VII improved on the cons  a bit other then that if you have not played the first two games yet you should.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalalification/recommended/353270/","kalalification","Kali","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalalification/","252 products in account","Re;Birth3 V Generation is basically a direct improvement over the previous entries in the series, and in many ways is even superior to the most recent mainline release, Victory 2. The quality-of-life improvements in R;B3 from previous entries are substantial, and the game itself, for those who haven't played Victory, is superb.\n\nThe Neptunia franchise, for those unfamiliar, features fairly standard JRPG gameplay, but the main attraction are the visual-novel-esque story and character interaction segments. In contrast to mk2/R;B2, Victory/RB;3 features a story that is far more about the characters than an overarching plot (though one is present). Most of the time you spend playing the game will probably be spent watching the very colorful cast interact with each other. The initial party (and main characters in this entry) of Neptune, Plutia, and Noire is an excellent combination of personalities that really sells the more slice-of-life atmosphere present in R;B3 compared to its predecessors. I think it really should be mentioned that Kana Hanazawa, who provides the voice for Plutia, is near her best in this game, demonstrating an absolutely masterful range and stellar performance.\n\nHaving played and enjoyed all of the main games in the franchise, I personally find Re;Birth 3 to be the most entertaining and fun entry in the series, narrowly beating out even V2. If you have played any of the other games in the series, I strongly encourage you to purchase this game, and if you have not yet played a Neptunia game but are interested in the series I think RB;3 is the best place to start.","March 8","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's got some tweeks to it to be certain but it almost feels like an episodic game at this point.\nCombat is fast and fluid, has some customization to it and is fun to do. The cutscenes are as basic as the previous ones, slightly animated portraits that talk at eachother infront of static backgrounds.\n\nThe music is funky, the character visuals and animations look great, backgrounds are like a budget PS2 era game (as usual). Gameplay is broken into long sessions of dialogue dumps, then you can hunt for more chatter on the overworld map, then there's the dungeons where ....I'm sure there's a review here that dives into this better than me, there's a lot you can do to dungeons to alter them with enemies and item drops.\n\nThere's not a lot to say on it since a lot of the visuals are reused, as is music, animations and the like. It's as dumb and fun as before, just with more polish. The human characters are given more balance by being able to power up like the CPUs, so you have a better selection of characters this time....and a lot of them to be sure. Every character you've ever seen in the series so far.\n\nSeriouness aside, I enjoy the nerdy console/game jokes they sling around a bunch, getting more of them than I'd like to admit. The humor is dumb, silly and cliche at parts. Fanservice? Not so into that but it's there if you like it!\n\nMy complaint lies in the imbalance of the DLC characters, it's awful. Some are insanely OP because of gear, and others have sub par gear and you can't upgrade them through much of the story. Ex: Kid IF has really strong weapons that were great for 2 chapters, regular IF has crap weapons and even weapons bought later had her lacking behind any other character by a long shot. But then you get Histy or the like and they have vastly superior gear to anyone and everyone. At level 1 they'll best your level 30+ characters in damage.\n\nFun game, more of the same and hopefully now that they're done remaking they'll have more variety in the series.\n\nIF is the best character still, just FYI, the main character really. I dunno why they keep calling it "Neptune" when the only smart one of the bunch is kickin' ♥♥♥ and moving the party of GODS along.","April 11","true","53.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Anyway, let's get into this shall we?\n\n\n+ Improved Controls, compared to the last two? This game is a god damn saint as far as controls go. No more finicking with the accursed joysticks to move around.\n+Improved Interface and function. Don't need to play with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls anymore to move and select things.\n+Neps, more Neps\n+Did I mention Neps?\n+Options configurations are actually saved this time around\n+More Delicious Neps\n+Stella's Dungeon run are alot more...bearable this time around and I actually went through it all the way.\n+1080p Waifus as always. I'm a vert fanboy personally, even though I don't like the xbox that much.\n+The ability to search item drops via the ingame options.  YES, though some of it is still rather obscure.\n+Audio and Visual are great as always, very colorful and the game does not take itself seriously which is a breather from all the super srs no fun allowed games  that pops up as of late.\n+Nepneps\n+I Might be a masochist for Sadie now.\n\n\nAnd with all nice things, there comes with terrible things about this game as well. Most of my complaints are in of a more mechanical nature, the engine or system itself. So pardon, which in itself is a good thing, most of the time.\n\nAs of 11/20/2015 these issues have not been addressed yet so a warning and heads up but don't let it deter you too much.\n\n\n-Its poorly optimized. At times you will crash due to the game not utilizing and allowing the game to allocate memory as needed. There is a workaround but this should honeslty not be necessary.\n\n-Poor framerates at times. I Have a top end GPU, a XFX DD R9 290X 4gb and I can barely get above 30 frames in some of the levels. I'm not sure what causes this one but its rather infuriating at times. You might not care but it does for me. It could be the fact taht the game itself is not utilizing all the 4 cores of my i5 2500k and what not, which is oftne the case as lot of games now a days are CPU bottlenecked rather than GPU assuming you've been keeping your comp sorta up to date.\n\n- THe game does suffer from a gradual memory leak as well.\n\n-Not enough neps\n\n\nAnd then we have the more ambigious thoughts where they don't really fall into either category.\n\n? How they handled the EXE and SP unlock is a bit convoluted and I had to look it up how to unlock stuff. This should not be needed.\n? You are pretty much playing the same game but with a new coat of paint and story, but if you bought the first two games and bought this one too? You got no one to blame but yourself.\n? Your parents may disown you.\n\n\nOverall thought:\n\nGreat game from a great series with loveable girls with delicious yuri undertone but sadly plagued with poor optmization and okay port.\n\n9/10-  I would give it a solid 10/10 but the mechanical problems docked off a point. Not a big problem but definitely something that should be addressed in the future games.\n\nI would still highly reccommend it either way.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vecturin/recommended/353270/","vecturin","АlphaWhelp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vecturin/","1029 products in account","The game runs at locked 60 FPS in all areas.  Can't remember what the Vita version ran at, but my awful memory doesn't remember it being as smooth as this version--and even if it was, you're probably still better off playing it on the PC for the larger resolution/display potential.\n\nSome stuff you might want to know.\n\n- All the free DLC found in the PSN store for this game is included automatically.  You don't have an option to not download it as far as I can tell.  That said, there is no DLC like the 2nd game that gives you a massively overpowered sword, so you won't have to worry about that.  The oracles are kind of strong, but the best characters are found in the base game, anyway.\n\n- There appears to be DLC (included for free) that wasn't in the PSN, or at least wasn't in the PSN when I originally bought the game there, and I haven't gone back to check to see if it was added later.  Appears to have some minor amounts of new content.\n\n- The game still does not good resolution support.  I have a 1920x1200 monitor which is not a supported resolution (max appears to be 1920x1080, although I do not know if a 1440p monitor unlocks a configuration option unavailble to me).  This forces me to play the game windowed or stretch/distort the game when playing in fullscreen.  This is not really a huge deal, but given that they've had 3 games to address this issue and still haven't bothered to, I feel it's worth mentioning at this point.\n\n- Going off the basis that everything else is the same as the Vita version, I'm going to go on and say that this is definitely the best game in the series so far.  It dramatically improves the system for ranged attacks, now allowing you to make ranged attacks at point blank range.  Every character has their own SP bar, so now you can't basically spam the hell out of EX Techniques to faceroll everything in the game (you actually can, but only with an extremely specific party composition).\n\n- Instead of tying everything to level, now, there are "achievements" per character that do things like unlock their EX move, leader skills, and other things.\n\n- The Chirper spam is significantly reduced.\n\n- Dungeon upgrades are more streamlines, you no longer have to worry about changing items, adding enemies, or changing dungeons.\n\n- Stella's dungeon is more interesting fun.  I recommend the DLC since some monsters apparently inflict 9999 damage if Stella can't kill them quickly enough (like an unlucky string of misses) even if she's otherwise invulnerable and easily capapble of clearing the area.  There is a way to get the DLC bonuses normally sort of, but it requires equipping/partnering with specific people for the dungeon.  The DLC allows you to get those bonuses while using completely different set ups.  It's also only 99 cents.  That's less than what most of you probably pay for garbage shovelware on Humble Bundle that you will never play.\n\n- I also buy many games from Humble Bundle that I will never play.","October 30, 2015","true","0.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","5","9","3","0"

Here's the run down, each area of Gamindustri has it's own CPU and CPU candidate that looks over each area. This time around however, you aren't going around collecting the mascots power or anything like that, instead (Spoiler warning) Neptune gets sent to an alternate dimension that is in the 80's (Y'know, when cassets where still a big thing for games) and must find her way back to her dimension while at the same time, helping that dimension with it's problems. As always, you can expect a lot of references to the actual game industry, videos games and anime while poking fun at them. It's a series that loves to reference everything it possibly can but if that's not your thing, you may find the comedy to be a bit dull or repetitive.\n\nSimilar to the other games, it feels very JRPG esc so there is little you won't be familiar with. It leads me to think if Idea Factory will ever do anything different from the other Neptunia games since almost every aspect of this game is identical to the others that are currently available on Steam. I sometimes like to think it's a "Stick to what you know and what you can do" situation but that can sometimes come off as being lazy or re-using assets, since there's hardly anything different about this game compared to the others, apart from new characters and story. Briefly onto the options menu, there's hardly one again but on the plus side, the game does run at a solid 60FPS.\n\nYet again, the dungeons themselves aren't anything to write home about since they're fairly small with some consisting of several floors. They're pretty standard dungeons, as far as JRPG's go and don't have much in the way of exploration, just a small amount of enemies littering the area and random items and material dotted around. You would think that they'd do something more with the dungeons, since many JRPG's do but you gradually grow bored of exploring them since there's hardly anything to explore.\n\nMoving on to the combat, there's practically nothing different here except for one change. Previously, you had to fill a guage everytime you entered a dungeon to pull off an EX finisher at the end of your combos by fighting enemies and would empty the moment you left the dungeon. Now however, your EX finishers are tied to your overall SP guage which makes the combat more enjoyable, albiet a bit easy. The games focus is it's strategy elements while being fast passed at the same time. In each battle, each character and enemy takes there turn when it's there's (Duh) so both you and the enemy can move each of your characters around the battle arena and position them carefully to get the most out of the battle. During one characters turn, you have multiple options for what you can have her do but only specific characters can do one special thing. There's:\n\nAttack,\nEXE skills,\nDefend,\nSP skills,\nHDD on/off,\nSwitch,\nItem,\nFlee.\n\nWhichever one you pick (Apart from HDD) will consume the characters turn and move to the next one in line. If you choose attack (Which you'll do a lot of the time) you are given the option to choose between three attacks that are tide to one of three buttons. These allow you to do different attacks which will have different effect but once you pick one, it'll move onto the next attack tab. Break focuses on depleting the enemies guard which if you accomplish that, the enemy will take more damage till it's there turn. Power which focuses on dealing damage and rush focuses on filling your SP guage. It leads to you having to mix and match your attacks together to deal with an enemy faster and effectively. The rest are pretty self explanatory apart from HDD on. Characters who are CPU's or CPU candidates have the ability to transform in the middle of battle, which increases there states but use up 20% of the SP gauge. Since it doesn't have any downsides to using it, you'll more then likely use it a lot of the time. Also, characters who aren't CPU's can also do there own transformation called Awaken which does practically the same thing.\n\nAs I've previously stated many times before and the main part of these games that I love so much is the art style. I adore how the environments are done, as well as how the characters are designed. Each are just so gorgeous to look at, they're colorful, bright and the way the colors blend together is fantastic. Speaking of the characters, we are introduced to a new character who goes by the name Plutia and I have to say, I find to her to be quite enjoyable. Her naiveté and simple minded attitude to almost everything everyone says is one of the amusing things. But, I wouldn't get on her bad side as she can also go HDD and that leads to her becoming sadistic. It can lead to some really creepy dialogue but I find it to be quite enjoyable.\n\nAt the end of it, I still find this to be quite an enjoyable experience, it's comedy focuses on referencing things from video games and anime and poking fun at them for there tropes and problems without it getting old. It's combat is very strategy focused and fast passed which is what I enjoy, leading to you blasting through each battle one at a time. Each character is unique in there own way and have there own personalities and characteristics that suit them perfectly, but also, because of who they are it can lead to a lot of mishaps and occasional funny moments to happen. It may disappoint some people though with how it is practially the same as the others with very little difference's. As some people have pointed out, it's like you're paying for the same game again just with a different story.","November 16, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game seems to have trouble running on older GPUs (even if the first two ran fine on the same hardware) and personally I've encountered a problem where enemies get stuck on their turn (music and animations still play but enemy just stands there) forcing me to restart the game.

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","By this point you should know exactly what you're looking for; the same exact game with more neps.\n\nOriginally posted by previous reviews:Just like the first...\n\nIt's repetitious & grindy as hell, has a lot of dumb references & jokes mainly relating to video games, almost all enemies and dungeons are recycled like no tomorrow, many locked dungeons and items can be missed on one playthrough thus must be retrieved on another because a lot of them can only be unlocked when you already have the plans (schematics) for unlocking them in a specific chapter (2). However screw all that because it's got Nep-neps.\n\nBut now...\n\nYou can have 4 members in your party\nThere are a buttload of new endings which are mostly actually just extra scenes after the credits\nLily ranks and EXE Drives are introduced much earlier\nA lot more new potential waifu party members are available for a choosin'\nA little "mini-game" where you send someone off to a dungeon for a period of time where they barely bring anything useful to you. (This little feature also presents a ginormous pain-in-the-fanny achievement.)\nThis time now...\n\nThe base game itself is a bit harder even without the difficulty altering, meaning that not being properly prepared can get you killed pretty fast\nThe SP bar is also now your EXE gauge which makes EXE drives more troublesome to use but requires you to think a bit more on when to actually use them\nCharacter specific EXE drives are unlocked via in-game achievements per character\n(via "Challenges" like "run a certain distance, jump this many times, etc.")\nAll of the previously released DLC (with the exception of the one in the Steam store) is included\nEvery character available for use in the previous Re;birth games are here\nSome of the side scenarios are out of order as if they don't belong in a specific chapter\nOnly three endings are present this time around (Normal, Good, & True)\nStella's Dungeon is relatively easier, even without cheating with the system clock\nShares are no longer relevant to the gameplay even though there's still a bar that shows them\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=547317661\n\nEnglish voice actors still suck and the audio should still remain in Japanese.\n\nBecause the localization regarding the translation is rather ♥♥♥ and often looks like it tries too hard to be funny you could try waiting for the Neptunia re-translation mods coming out soon that replaces the current game's text with more accurate & less cringe-inducing translations.

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","By this point you should know exactly what you're looking for; the same exact game with more neps.\n\nOriginally posted by previous reviews:Just like the first...\n\nIt's repetitious & grindy as hell, has a lot of dumb references & jokes mainly relating to video games, almost all enemies and dungeons are recycled like no tomorrow, many locked dungeons and items can be missed on one playthrough thus must be retrieved on another because a lot of them can only be unlocked when you already have the plans (schematics) for unlocking them in a specific chapter (2). However screw all that because it's got Nep-neps.\n\nBut now...\n\nYou can have 4 members in your party\nThere are a buttload of new endings which are mostly actually just extra scenes after the credits\nLily ranks and EXE Drives are introduced much earlier\nA lot more new potential waifu party members are available for a choosin'\nA little "mini-game" where you send someone off to a dungeon for a period of time where they barely bring anything useful to you. (This little feature also presents a ginormous pain-in-the-fanny achievement.)\nThis time now...\n\nThe base game itself is a bit harder even without the difficulty altering, meaning that not being properly prepared can get you killed pretty fast\nThe SP bar is also now your EXE gauge which makes EXE drives more troublesome to use but requires you to think a bit more on when to actually use them\nCharacter specific EXE drives are unlocked via in-game achievements per character\n(via "Challenges" like "run a certain distance, jump this many times, etc.")\nAll of the previously released DLC (with the exception of the one in the Steam store) is included\nEvery character available for use in the previous Re;birth games are here\nSome of the side scenarios are out of order as if they don't belong in a specific chapter\nOnly three endings are present this time around (Normal, Good, & True)\nStella's Dungeon is relatively easier, even without cheating with the system clock\nShares are no longer relevant to the gameplay even though there's still a bar that shows them\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=547317661\n\nEnglish voice actors still suck and the audio should still remain in Japanese.\n\nBecause the localization regarding the translation is rather ♥♥♥ and often looks like it tries too hard to be funny you could try waiting for the Neptunia re-translation mods coming out soon that replaces the current game's text with more accurate & less cringe-inducing translations. (Re-translation mod for Re;birth 2 is already out)","November 15, 2015","true","158.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And I'm here to tell you...\n\nShort version- YES!\n\nLong version-\nFirst off, the story focuses on just the CPUs. While the side characters can still be there, they're included as dlc when you download the game, so you can choose whether to have them in the game or not!\n\nSecond, there's changes to the gameplay. While the core gameplay exists (rush, power, and break attacks), it's a lot more different that 1&2. Now, instead of an exe drive, you know use the sp bar for exe related attacks. Meaning you can't spam the exe attacks like you use to, and you also have to plan how you use your other sp attacks. Meaning the game is a lot more strategic!\n\nThird, grinding is a lot more fun now thanks to some additions. Each character can level up by doing certain tasks. For ex. Neptune finding 10 items as a lead character can level up her luck. And this goes for EVERY character, giving you a reason to swich who you leader is. (Oh, and btw, there's leader skills too!)\n\nAnd even though there's much more, the last thing I'll say is that THIS ISN'T A BAD PORT! If you ran rebirth 1, you'll have no trouble running rebirth 3. :D\n\nSo what are you waiting for, get the game!","October 31, 2015","true","634.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is indeed the best Neptunia game I have played so far compared to Re;Birth 1 and 2.\n\nMy reasons? It's because this game literally references back when Sega and Nintendo were fighting.\nIf you don't know ANY of this, you will NOT enjoy this. I repeat, if you seriously don't know about history between where Sega does what Nintendon't and when Playstation comes in to make both Sega and Nintendo's life hard, please don't say this game is bad because you simply don't understand what the creators tried to show here.\n\nThat was literally the purpose of this game. Though I'm only in chapter 3, I'm already laughing my butt off because of the references to these old consoles with their pathetic weaknesses. It also shows how old game companies used to live and die and if you did a lot of research, Neptunia references a LOT of game companies and of course other games.\n\nIf you have played the first 2, you'd love the fact that in the third installment, you don't have the SP gauge no more, in other words, no more worrying you'd run out of SP and instead, more beating up stuff. Sure it gets repetitive, but to complete the game, it's not that bad. Unless of course if you are like me who tries to 100% the game. I've 100% Neptunia 1 and 2 and trust me, it can get a little repetitive, but very worth it. I may change this review again after I finish the game, but I seriously enjoy this game too much already due to the references and better mechanics compared to the first and second. Take my advice if you are into retro games.","November 25, 2015","true","27.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

A lot of the good things about Fairy Fencer F are in this game. I do wish they didn't reuse so many dungeons. I will say that the new dungeons are a bit of fresh air, and absolutely gorgeous. However, the amount of reused dungeons is staggering. Well, they aren't reused as much as a bunch of dungeons were created / taken from Rebirth 3 / Neptunia V\n\nThey re-recorded the voices. A side-effect is that Neptune's Japanese voice has a higher pitch. Ugh. That took a while to get used to. Plutia is another paint-by-numbers character, but her interactions make up for a lot. Noire steals the spotlight though. I also like that IF and Compa aren't in the beginning of the game. I haven't gotten too far, yet\n\nI don't like Plutia that much. She was pretty good for a while, but they took her over the top. There's also improvements on item finding. You can now press Y in the requirements list to tell you which dungeon, if you have it unlocked, has the item. I guess they realized that we'd Google it anyways\n\nAs a budget game, it's good. I wouldn't buy it at $30 though.\n\nI also get some lags in the new dungeons. I have a Core i7 4790k and a Radeon 7870.

Now in May 2016, which is how many months after my first impression.\n\nThe story is fine, it's the reason why I bought this game. A couple of carefree female leads stopping an evil army or person (which in a shellnut, are the first two Re;birth games too.)\n\nGameplay is bland, just simply break the guard of the enemy, and constantly spam the attack button, with the additions of spells and support.\n\nThis game could be renamed to the "one frame per second simulator", cause that's exactly what I am experiencing right now.\n\nIt is so poorly optimised, that it may actually be possible that they just copied the PS Vita files, dragged and copied it onto the computer.\n\nAdjusting the resolution to the smallest possible does nothing to improve it. Everytime I move, or do an action, it freezes to a complete halt. It sporadically halts every minute or two.\n\nI could not continue if this is the case. The poor optimisation makes it impossible to load up boss battles, which probably takes up more to render the textures and whatnot.\n\nIt's a pain to close the game, as it slows down my entire computer too. It takes a million years to open up the task manager and close it manually, since the close button on the window does not work.\n\nIn summary, the gameplay and story may be interesting, but the game's not letting me play. It's not loading. The game window just constantly looses responsiveness.\n\nLike other reviewers have mentioned, this optimisation just seems to gradually worsen as more and more Hyperdimension games pop out.\n\nPlease get a better computer before buying this game.\n\nAlso.\n\nThis game is made for weebs.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________","December 31, 2015","false","31.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

If you felt the previous two titles had about the right amount of dialogue or too much dialogue you'll quickly get frustrated and start using the skip function, even when skipping you may feel you spend 50% of the game tied up in character interaction rather than gameplay. This issue is compounded by the free DLC that pretty much doubles up on the cutscenes in a game that already has a lot of it.\n\nPersonally I play it for the gameplay, which I really like, sprinkled with some amusing conversation.

Without the depth. Each character has a max of about 3 special abilities/spells. Also the characters are not balanced with each other at all, there are some characters that are clearly much more powerful than their counterparts, so really there is no reason to ever use them. The combat system is pretty important, because you will be doing a lot of fighting. And I do mean a lot, its pretty much grinding simulator, the game.\n\nAs for the comedy elements, its... well its just really not that funny. The game is self aware, but it just doesn't execute it all that well. The puns and the references are kindof fun for an hour, but after that it just gets repetitive. Here is an example of one of their recurring 'jokes', Neptunia/toher says I want to play video games, someone gets mad and yells at them, they are scared of person and call them a stupid name that signifies they are angry/unreasonable. Did you laugh? Well that is repeated about 59 times so you had better enjoy it.\n\nAnother thing is the side characters that you get while going through the game. What is the point of them? They aren't even acknowledged in the main game. It is entirely possible for you to have a character, that according to the story is in the castle doing important work, also somehow go around helping you destroy monsters to fulfill your daily quota. Some characters dont have any story at all, and seem to be shoved in just so they could have more characters.\n\nAlso it is very hard to play with a keyboard, this game was made for a controller and shows it, so if you dont have a controller, you will have a bad time figuring out the controls.\n\nOverall the game wasn't terrible, it just wasn't that good.","January 9","false","7.6"," 11 of 33 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","11","33","0","1"

It's more or less the same exact thing as the previous titles, with slightly upgraded visuals. The only thing it has going for it is the humor. The combat feels bland, uninspired, and dull, as it is literally the same thing as the last two, except now you can do one more attack. Whee.\n\nThe special attacks are also all copy/pasted from the previous titles, they didn't even give neptune anything new, which is really kind of silly and lazy, since she is the main character for crying out loud. This game, much like 2, just feels lazy and is kind of an insult to the fans. To charge this much for the game when it is all literally the same thing as the previous two is BS.\n\nThe dungeons are also all the same as the last two, the maps are also literally copy/pasted. The layouts are all the same, the asthetics have not changed one bit, and the music is all the same too. How does this game company seriously get away with doing this, whereas any other game company makes one minor mistake and the fans burn them at the stake?\n\nThe music is all the ♥♥♥♥in same. Not much more I can say on this.\n\nThe fans seriously need to get over their obsessive love for Neptune and see this game and the previous ones for its huge flaws and not buy into this kind of stuff anymore.\n\n\n\nThere are also huge plot holes in the story as well as inconsistencies with character development.\n\n************************SPOILERS************************\n\n\nYou recuit adult IF and Child IF, as well as child Compa and Adult Compa in the same party, That's cool, I guess, for people who prefer adult over child, but they don't even give us a small story as to why they are suddenly added. It's just "IF has Joined" "Compa has joined."\n\nOn the subject of IF and Compa, you progress into the story, you are introduced to Baby IF, Compa, and Peashy. They are babies in one scene, Children in the next, then back to being babies. Really? This is so sloppily done it is apalling. No, I did not miss previous scenes or wait til later to do certain ones, I did the events right as they appeared.\n\nVert is introduced, declares war on the CPUs. Ok, cool plot, but hey, I have an event with MarvelousAQL talking about ♥♥♥♥♥ size. Suddenly vert is with us in Planeptune being all chummy with us like the main story isn't even a thing.\n\n*******************************SPOILERS OVER*********************************\n\n\nThere are many other inconsistencies that I am sure that I have not come to yet, as I have not yet completed the game, as well as events I may have forgotten about.\n\nIt's just ♥♥♥♥ poor game design that really should not be excused just because you happen to like a character just because she's a loli. It's a stupid reason. So if The order 1886's main character was a loli, you would excuse it for it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay and story? Don't answer that. It just shows how far the gaming industry has fallen because they can get away with anything as long as it includes A) Loli B) Boobs or C) Loli with boobs.\n\nYou are much better off watching this on youtube or just reading the wiki for a quick summary for the events instead of wasting your money on this like I did, or basing your purchase choice on the positive reviews which are all "Nep nep nep boobs nep desu loli I am lonely my friends dont talk to me hurp derp" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, useless reviews, which pretty much makes the rule "Never read the positive reviews" a requirement. Those help no one, and they aren't funny or cute.\n\nNo doubt this review will be downvoted to oblivion by the fans of this game, but I spoke my opinion.\n\nThank you and have a fantastic day.\n\nSide Note: Negative/Flaming comments WILL be deleted.","November 1, 2015","false","44.2"," 97 of 222 people (44%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","44","97","222","9","30"

I'll tell the game is GREAT and i enjoyed it very much. So why i don't recommend? I will tell now.\nAs the game story and gameplay are good, the port to PC SUCKS. That's why i don't recommend it.\nAt start, when it say 64bit OS, believe, it IS. Doesn't matter how smooth it runs on 32 bits it will stuck, soon or late. Done that, you start a random bullet on head. Your PC may or may not run the game. Doesn't matter if you have or not the required to run (I have above and still crashes). You might want ask Idea Factory for help with game issues, as crashes and bugs. They will reply your email only to check your comp settings and hardware. Done that, forget more help. So, unless you use the Steam Guide for crashes and bugs, you won't advance on the game. It can't stand longplays. At least with me, the sounds start bugging and at some point, it crash. Usually when having a long battle. Crash.The game lacks a manual too. Nothing will say what or how to do and the ingame help is very basic as "jump button for jump". I'll say. If you buy it, be aware that it may crash like hell and you will have to find solution on your own.\n\nNow the game. The game is good. Funny. Pure comedy with tons of subliminal yuri content and hot anime chicks. Good action with the fights and as soon you get used with the gameplay (as menus and arraging your charact combat skills) it can become funny and keep you busy for hours.","February 5","false","167.9"," 8 of 28 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","8","28","0","0"

This version has an abundance of puns, conversations, quirkiness, and of course, nepneps. Only con that I have come across so far in my 4.7 hours of playing this game is the following: the game stops loading during battle. You sit there staring at the screen wondering if the mob or your characters are going to attack or take their turn; however, the game just sits there... idling... but the game isn't freezing or crashing. No, the game is still going on. Stella just finished her dungeon! But, you're still sitting there... waiting for your turn. Yes, I waited at least 10 minutes thinking, "Maybe, the game is still loading..." Sadly, it didn't continue to load. I had to restart the game, and yes, I lost my progress because I was in a dungeon and in mid-battle. Sigh.

It was an overall peaceful and somewhat dull experience, but I did like the relatively calm story which was unprecedented/unusual, & some of the choreography of the animations as well as some of the gimmicks (though I thought the animations were bad), I felt the combat system was deeper than all other other JRPG I played (eternal sonata, quest 64) which is something I enjoyed.\n\nAfter playing through the entire game, and getting all of the steam achievements (didn't do new game+) I finally feel qualified to make this review.\n\n\nPLAYSTYLE/PERSPECTIVE\nFrom the perspective of an western gamer, who can only speak/read english.\nI played as a semi-completionist, searching through most of the dungeons as they became available, cataloging the monsters and loot drops, but not fretting too much over missed content (locked behind RNG) too much.\nI played as a binge player, who would commit entire days to this game.\nI actively avoided the free beneficial DLC content (I dislike most/all? DLC on principle) perhaps so I can experience the game as "it was intended" for the average (non steam) buyer.\nI came in expecting something of the quality of dota 2, tribes 2, fallout 3, deadcore, perimeter, stalker, delta force 2, halo, the total war series, serious sam, eternal sonata, ETC. Generally things that are AA or AAA quality (sometimes A).\n\nBEGINNING\nIt was an awful first impression, after even downloading the game I met technical difficulty, where I did not have the required download installed for the game, I came in expecting to be submerged into a pleasant fantasy land of anime girls in a gamey world immediately and conveniently, too bad I had to have my experience halted by this rather rude intrusion of "reality" (the technical problematic lens). Once I got the game to work (by downloading a somewhat vaguely described redistributable on my internet browser), and being relieved, I was met with what I thought was a shockingly bad introduction, where upon my character gets beaten down, but what was bad about it was that the animation quality was surprisingly bad (like a good quality MMD fan animation) and that my character made only 1 pain-scream when being struck, giving the impression of a bad Wii game (might sound small, but it was huge to me). Usually games like this want to leave a good impression, but this one left an awful one, heck, even the game "chex quest" somehow left a better first impression than this game (and that game literally came out of my cereal box). I was planning to get this game refunded during this disappointing phase, but knowing I had 2 hours to "demo" the game before steam refunds were disabled, I continued until I got a better look at the game. In a way, it is quite shocking that a game like this would leave such a bad impression so quickly, as if they aren't aware that there is a refund policy in place.\n\nBEGINNING 2\nIn a bit of a haze, I proceeded in the game, expecting further disappointments, which showed rather quickly when I found my first segment of storytelling that lacked voice acting, me coming from games like fallout 3, skyrim, and eternal sonata expected that all or most of the lines displayed in the chat box would be uttered by some voice actor, but rather, only about 50% of the main story is voiced, and only about 20% of sidequests (if any) were voiced, I was again further negatively surprised, but this defect was somewhat beneficial/mitigated; as the lack of the voice acting let me fill in the voice acting with my imagination (such as replacing some voices with voices from other games, usually inappropriately), and in a way this somewhat added to my experience. Though, I doubt others would rise to this "challenge", and is still a fault to be considered, I really would have preferred a 60-70% voice acting on the story dialog, but sadly, it was not the case.\nThere were 2 notable flaws in the game that left somewhat lasting impression which is the dominatrix's lost 3 second static pose when she "transforms into existence" with bad english lip-syncing, and a camera that clips through her segmented sword, and the playstation character's sometimes cringe-worthy "tryhard" deep voice, though I was fond of some of the defects (tryhard voice).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMIDDLE/LATE\nThe middle of the game was perhaps the best enjoyed part of it, after I had my expectations passively beaten down my the overall quality, and this was a time of discovery. I really started to get into the more difficult content, and I started to notice some of the complexities of the combat system, like how one might want to align turns to initiate a guard break, and use ultimates, and typically having enough complexity to cause me to delay and think what action to do sometimes, and with enough complexity to prevent it from getting too formulaic too quickly, (though formulas are naturally developed) in fact, this would be the most tactically deep JRPG I have played, and I enjoyed it, though the system tends to degrade later on and problems started to crop up (formulas were developed), since I was playing as a semi-completionist, I would do dungeons, but most of the dungeons would only have 1 formulaic way of "clearing them"; 1. beat each enemy until it dropped all of it's items, 2, fight the boss 1-3 times, which typically require 1 of 3 strategies with some permutations (1. power attack spam/use ultimates, for the weakest bosses, 2. Buff your characters, break guard/weaken enemies, then kill with ultimate, 3. buff, weaken guard, buff, align turns (making it so that most of your characters will be able to attack before the bosses turn), use ultimates, then finish off.), 3. Run through the dungeon again, ignoring the enemies, and headbutting the camouflaged boxes so that you can better "catalog" the items that come out of them (because it tends to be random). Then rinse/repeat for every other dungeon you unlock, skipping step 1 for upgraded dungeons that recycle enemies. In a way, step 3 was relaxing, (after I got the upgrade that trivializes finding the boxes but hellish before) so it wasn't that bad. But the boss fight distinctly lacked variety in methodologies to beat, there were some helpful differences such as the 7 elite boss type, and the boss with disabling helpers, but much too rare to be really helpful (about 4% are different), which is surprising, I'd think that more exotic bosses would be easy to implement. There is also a minor concern of stats, there is no explanation of them, while some stats can largely be figured out (like strength being attack power) some can be mistaken for others, one could think that vitality is related to HP amount instead of it functioning as "armor" or "men" (mental?) having some affect on SP(mana) regeneration instead of it being "magic armor", this is largely irrelevant since you cannot really "build" characters to have extreme stat imbalances and/or character specialties, and how the game is generally very easy, (even going so far as to send some story bosses in waves, instead all at once even though it is explicit that the bosses are in a group) thus not really requiring understanding of the stats, but another rather small deficiency.\n\nDue to the character limit, you will need to search the last 3 pages of the comments to find the remainder of the review.","December 6, 2015","false","224.5"," 12 of 44 people (27%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","27","12","44","3","22"

The odd,yet very interesting thing is that the girls are all based or represent game consoles or game engines.\n\nPros:\n+Very fun story and dialogue between the characters\n+ Cute and likeable characters\n+4th wall breaking- Adds a certain charm to the game and makes things funnier\n+Battling- You will be doing a lot of battles in which you will be doing the same thing over and over again,but because of the pretty animations and cool Special abilities,it doesn't get boring\n+Design of characters- All of the characters have some things,like ribbons,hairpins or clothing that clues and hints on the game console or engine they are representing\n+Customization- Many accesories and clothing to dress your characters into\n+Do a lot of stuff- There is a lot of grinding to be done and for the most part it is well done\n+Story is easy to get into- Playing the previous Hyperdimension games is not necessary to understand the story,since it pretty light-hearthed\n+Light yuri and ship-teasing\n\nCons:\n-Technical Difficulties- Had to mess a lot with the properties and install some other stuff to get the game to function properly. Sometimes the game stilll crashes for me on one of the two PC's I played this game on.\n-Too difficult to grind- I said that the grinding was well done,but there are some things that require an insane amount of work and time spent to be achieved. Getting all of the endings is one of those things. (to get them all you need to beat the game 3+ times!)\n-Dungeon and enemy recycling- This is a very big game,which uses recycled maps and enemies to great amount. While I can tolerate the recycling of enemies,since a lot of RPG's and other games do that,I can't tolerate the recycling of the same map for 4+ times.\n-Repetition of tropes- This is an anime-like game and expect to see a lot of stuff you saw a million times before (There is the topic of breast sizes,which the characters talk about quite a handful of times. It may be funny the first or second time,but after that you feel like you are watching you saw already and know the ending of it).\n-Not enough yuri - Moar is required\n\nOverall,this game is/was very fun to play and I will spend more time playing it. Hyperdimension is one of the best RPG's I played and will be a big favorite of mine. Looking forward to more Hyperdimension Neptunia games and I may play the other games aswell.

When I first started playing I felt it was a bit too cute and boring, but then after a little time I totally enjoyed it as the story is very good. I love the way the characters are different with some great lines.\n\nSo, yep, I am happy to have this game in my collection! :D","November 7, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are the other returning mechanics from the previous games as well like HDD what now has a human counterpart called Awakening so now every human or the oracles can use this ability to gain buff like the hdd but no physical changes to the character.\n\nThe story is almost the same as Victory (the original game) with some added things like a line about the re;birth 2 added routes. The story this time unlike the writing in re;birth 2 is better and is quite enjoyable and had me laughing at many parts of the game and actually enjoying all of the characters unlike a certian character in re;birth 2 (damn it underling!).\n\nThis time in the game  you have access to a whole load of characters with it mainly being everycharacter shown in the main series of the games which rounds the roster up to the near 30's or over that with each one having different traits what make them unique.\n\nThere was also some features what seemed to be borrowed from another game Fairy fencer F (i dont know if this is true this is something i thought of) and thats random rewards for just playing the game like battling alone 10 times gives you strength what is helpful but is required to get some plans for the character (meaning 100% the game will take a while).\n\nI would recommend that you pick up this game if your a fan of the series in general or wanting to find a enjoyable game to play and probably newcommers aswell due to there is little to none mention of the previous games (well there is a slight hint towards re;birth 1 and 2).\n","December 3, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I've clocked over 35 hours in the game according to the save file.\n\nSo, a return to the Hyperdimension Series. Frankly, as far as i'm concerned, Compile Heart and Idea Factory (US)/Marvelous AQL (EU) can't pump out these games fast enough. Each is good in its own right.\n\nDo note that if you're expecting a serious plot with high drama then this is not the game for you.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 returns to the universe first introduced by Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 and sees the characters of that universe once again battling the forces of piracy in abstract form. However, where Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 tackled this basic plot in a rather anvilicious manner, R3 is altogether a better game. This is largely because of the reinclusion of Neptune as the main character and the antics she brings to the table; the Hyperdimension Series has never been about the story itself, but about the interaction with the characters that the writers bring to the table, and their interactions with each other. As such, HDN: R3 improves upon the formula introduced by the first game in almost every way but one: combat.\n\nPart of the fun, personally speaking, was being able in HDN: R1 to pull off insane attacks with little effort. R3 attempts to curb this "abuse" by making EXE attacks both unlockable via achievements and require most--if not all--of a character's SP. Until you get the "drill" disc modification in the latter stage of the game, this heavily limits tactical options, as maintaining one's SP in battle becomes a chore in its own right.\n\nan additional criticism of mine would be the game's performance even on relatively new machines. While the game is advertised as being playable at 60fps on 1080p resolutions, the reality is that the game presently locks itself into certain framerates and resolutions. with 8 gigs of ram, a dual core i7 5500U, and an AMD Radeon R9 M275--capable of getting upwards of 40 frames on fallout 4 at 720p and 50 frames on Warthunder on high settings at 1080p, I get a measly 27-30 frames on HDN;R3 at a locked resolution of 1280x720. Either due to a function of bad drivers or poor port-programming, all of the games in the HDN: R series perform poorly on systems which are well above the listed specifications. This may in part due to the games running heavily off of the CPU and not really using the GPU at full capacity.\n\nIn sum:\n\nPros:\n-more nep\n-shinier prettier graphics\n-more of the parody and cute girls doing cute things that the fans have come to expect.\n-more replayability\n\ncons\n-poor performance graphics-wise\n-combat system has been poorly revised, and fails to add tactical depth\n-annoying achievements to unlock potentially crucial character abilities\n-limited post main-plot-arc content; sequel hook seems like an afterthought\n\nOverall Score:\n8 neps out of 10.","November 20, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's quite some changes from the previous iterations but the core game play is still the same. It is a direct sequel to Re;birth2 and drops reference to it from time to time but it is much better story-wise. If you have played the previous ones, you already knew what you're getting into so it is a must-buy especially if you're a fan of the franchise and of this genre.\n\nNote that this is a game with a dose of JRPG-esque mechanics that caters niche audience so do not expect anything extraordinary.","November 21, 2015","true","186.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe because the protag was Gear-chan (too serious), but rebirth2 lacked a lot of the humor of the first game for like 80% of the game. This game definitely takes the best of the first game's tone and adds on a revamped UI and even more fun and humor. I'm only into ch 1 but I'm already in love with the game already!\n\nI don't know if I would recommend slogging through game 2 to get all the references here, but upon doing so you'll really feel the engine improvement between this and games 1 and 2.\n\n**EDIT 1: Into chapter 3, and there's a LOT of translation freedom here. It's a little hard to tell sometimes whether some things were intentionally mispelled or not.\n\n**EDIT 2: I finished the game, and to sum it up:\n\n+ A TON of content and new stuff to play with, and more characters than you'll know what to do with (all the DLC are included with this game except the one for stella's dungeon I think, which you should definitely get)\n+ You'll definitely get all the references Rebirth1 had to this game, making it feel like you travelled in time.\n+ Neptune is best protag. Plutia is love. Plutia is Life.\n+ The UI and battle system is vastly improved. Everyone gets "CPU form" in a sense. Equipping a backline makes sense.\n+ Stella's dungeon makes ingredient grinding much less grindy, and it's faster too and more interesting.\n+ The difficulty curve is the smoothest of all 3 games. Haven't had any major grinding issues.\n+ The story was better than 2. The writing was worse though. YMMV.\n+ Eggplant scene.\n+ The battle system has been heavily revamped in a sense. The EXE gauge has changed to a personal SP bar, and EXE drives were nerfed quite a bit. Slightly different system to play around with.\n\n- The writing is really bad. Like, Rei-stuttering-inducing levels of bad at times. The overall plot is not bad though.\n- The game feels a LOT longer to slog through for multiple playthroughs. Probably also due to all the loading screens inbetween areas.\n- If you don't play with DLC characters you probably won't get a full party till the end of the True Ending path.\n\n\nBest game of the 3 so far. Heavily recommend it. After playing this, going back to rebirth1 feels a bit like going back to a PS1 from a PS3.","November 7, 2015","true","78.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know who localized the dialogue for this entry into the Neptunia series but they really did an outstanding job here.  The banter alone really makes this game worth playing.\n\nCombat is flashy and fun to watch.  There is a fair amount of depth to developing your characters if you so choose.  Stats are influenced by discs, shares, different armor sets but it's not really necessary to beat the main story.  If you choose to beat the extra end game bosses however min/maxing your characters even at max level is going to be required so there is some challenge there to be had.  With that said it is a JRPG so the actual combat boils down to selecting an attack and watching it happen so if thats not your cup of tea this may not be for you.\n\nThe english voice overs aren't complete as with previous games but you can switch to Japanese in the menu.\n\nMajor con is a bug that causes the game to freeze and crash.  A fix has been posted by users but unfortunately IF/Compile have not released an official patch to address the issue.\n\n","November 25, 2015","true","86.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's standard Compile Hearts fare to improve slightly over time, so this game is technically superior over the previous two available on steam.\n\nSound is heavily rehashed.This may be a good thing or a bad thing,depending on how you like it before.\n\nGraphics are Japanese standard, with a focus on aesthetics rather than technical flair. That aside the graphics are par for the course of a low budget title ported from a handheld console.\n\nOverall pretty dope.\nMore Neppu so I'm happy.","December 12, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The "Blue Ninja Girl" was an erotic series which involved the protagonist fighting her enemies with... Sexual techniques. Don't ask me how I know this but I was very surprised that this game's knowledge of Anime, Manga and Games went so deep.\n\n3,The battle system is a mix of turn-based and action (although more on the turn-based side) The system is indeed unique to me when I started from Re;birth 1 and was definitely a fresh new concept. I found it very interesting and will probably be able to cater to the majority of the audiences whom are biased to one side between fast-paced combat and turn-based combat.\n\n4.Finally, Neptune Best Grill.","January 6","true","47.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know who localized the dialogue for this entry into the Neptunia series but they really did an outstanding job here.  The banter alone really makes this game worth playing.\n\nCombat is flashy and fun to watch.  There is a fair amount of depth to developing your characters if you so choose.  Stats are influenced by discs, shares, different armor sets but it's not really necessary to beat the main story.  If you choose to beat the extra end game bosses however min/maxing your characters even at max level is going to be required so there is some challenge there to be had.  With that said it is a JRPG so the actual combat boils down to selecting an attack and watching it happen so if thats not your cup of tea this may not be for you.\n\nThe english voice overs aren't complete as with previous games but you can switch to Japanese in the menu.\n\nMajor con is a bug that causes the game to freeze and crash.  A fix has been posted by users but unfortunately IF/Compile have not released an official patch to address the issue.\n\n","November 25, 2015","true","86.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are the other returning mechanics from the previous games as well like HDD what now has a human counterpart called Awakening so now every human or the oracles can use this ability to gain buff like the hdd but no physical changes to the character.\n\nThe story is almost the same as Victory (the original game) with some added things like a line about the re;birth 2 added routes. The story this time unlike the writing in re;birth 2 is better and is quite enjoyable and had me laughing at many parts of the game and actually enjoying all of the characters unlike a certian character in re;birth 2 (damn it underling!).\n\nThis time in the game  you have access to a whole load of characters with it mainly being everycharacter shown in the main series of the games which rounds the roster up to the near 30's or over that with each one having different traits what make them unique.\n\nThere was also some features what seemed to be borrowed from another game Fairy fencer F (i dont know if this is true this is something i thought of) and thats random rewards for just playing the game like battling alone 10 times gives you strength what is helpful but is required to get some plans for the character (meaning 100% the game will take a while).\n\nI would recommend that you pick up this game if your a fan of the series in general or wanting to find a enjoyable game to play and probably newcommers aswell due to there is little to none mention of the previous games (well there is a slight hint towards re;birth 1 and 2).\n","December 3, 2015","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

New changes include the removal of the EXE drive (SP is used instead and is generated similarly; SP potions are pretty much gone). EX Finishers are now selected one per category, which makes it easier to tell what they do and makes combat planning a lot easier. Beyond that it's more of the same.\n\nThe port is decent too, being stable everywhere aside from a couple areas. No FPS cap, though higher framerates tend to screw with the jump function sometimes (not a big deal).","December 17, 2015","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's so lighthearted and fun that it keeps me coming back day and day again. Over previous titles, this one follows suit with some additions to the formula. EXE gauge has been eliminated from Rebirth1, instead integrating it into the SP gauge for individual players. The tactics are much more sound and require slightly more thought than before, but then again, I've been playing with all the DLC from the first carried over to here. SO, I am barely halfway through the game, but with 20 party members. The choices are so variable.\n\nIn total, I find the humor and story to be spot-on, and the antagonists are memorable spare for a couple. I can't help but feel sympathy for Copypaste, as I really like the direction he took later on. Also, Anonydeath has been a favorite of mine since I saw the anime. I cannot ever forget his top tier line. "My metal gear may be Solid Snake, but my heart's as maidly as they come." Priceless.\n\nIf you like JRPGs and graphic novels, this may hit a soft spot. Also, Neptune's constant spewing of references, whether you pick up on them all or not, kills me. No joke, I pretty much do that myself all the time. I enjoy this game thoroughly and hope to see the colisseum fixed soon.\n\nI genuinely can NOT wait for Action Unleashed to be released on Steam. Since I don't have a PS Vita I am just dying to play a more active variant of a Neptunia game. AAAAAGH!!!","November 11, 2015","true","82.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CatFurever/recommended/353270/","CatFurever","Lewcina","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CatFurever/","44 products in account","Half JRPG, half Visual Novel; Neptune and our favorite characters of all shapes and sizes return for another game full of light humor, fanservice, fourth wall breaking and button mash-to-win. Compared to the previous titles, the battle system has been revamped, changing the SP/EXE drive system, introducing plans to extend combos, enabling up to four characters to fight simultaneously and more. Plus you no longer have to mash the Y key in dungeons while hearing the same sound over and over to find hidden goods. They're now in convenient boxes scattered across the world. Yay!\n\nStory-wise, the game sticks to its roots. Everything is taken lightly, cuteness and the occasional fanservice is everywhere. Some jokes are taken a tad too far - the size of Blanc's chest to fourth wall breaking stacked onto fourth wall breaking. It's actually a rather refreshing Visual Novel, with a good portion of the story events voiced. Plus, the option to swap between the English and Japanese voices is a plus.\n\nIn terms of the combat and dungeoning, Re;birth3 does a better job at balance and dungeon progression, with a defined difficulty curve in the story dungeons and a large number of side dungeons in case one wishes to do some grinding. Yes, the dungeons are repetitive, often the same tileset with minor modifications, and most enemies (there are actually many different types) usually share the same sprites, but it isn't too big of a deal. The new combat system starts feeling a bit odd, considering SP and EXE are now one and the same, but eventually you get used to it and realize how ridiculous SP Boosters are. Unfortunately this makes Rush type skills far less valuable as SP Boosters now contribute directly to EXE Drive and Skills can be spammed less. The plus side is you don't have to grind EXE every single time a dungeon instance is entered or reset.\n\nLike the other remakes, re;birth3 has a ton of DLC (which is actually included this time for free! sans the mega-convenient one) adding in a ton of humorous events and characters. Stella's dungeon is back from re;birth2 with far more valuable rewards to be gained. Mostly the same system, but some bonus items can be scored by having a scout detect a new area upon clearing a floor.\n\nOverall, as a JRPG, the game is quite simplistic, and fairly grindy (even with Super EXP Up). Not really for everyone, especially those who aren't really a fan of the art/story/characters. As a Visual Novel, the game is incredibly entertaining, making events shy away from mashing a button hoping it ends to something worth savoring. Especially if it's voiced. If you're a fan of the Neptunia games, this is definitely worth it. If you don't mind grindy JRPGs and a bit of fanservice, this is definitely worth it. Eh. As long as you don't mind the art style, characters, JRPG elements and writing, this game is totally worth it.","January 4","true","67.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've clocked over 35 hours in the game according to the save file.\n\nSo, a return to the Hyperdimension Series. Frankly, as far as i'm concerned, Compile Heart and Idea Factory (US)/Marvelous AQL (EU) can't pump out these games fast enough. Each is good in its own right.\n\nDo note that if you're expecting a serious plot with high drama then this is not the game for you.\n\nHyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 3 returns to the universe first introduced by Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 and sees the characters of that universe once again battling the forces of piracy in abstract form. However, where Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 2 tackled this basic plot in a rather anvilicious manner, R3 is altogether a better game. This is largely because of the reinclusion of Neptune as the main character and the antics she brings to the table; the Hyperdimension Series has never been about the story itself, but about the interaction with the characters that the writers bring to the table, and their interactions with each other. As such, HDN: R3 improves upon the formula introduced by the first game in almost every way but one: combat.\n\nPart of the fun, personally speaking, was being able in HDN: R1 to pull off insane attacks with little effort. R3 attempts to curb this "abuse" by making EXE attacks both unlockable via achievements and require most--if not all--of a character's SP. Until you get the "drill" disc modification in the latter stage of the game, this heavily limits tactical options, as maintaining one's SP in battle becomes a chore in its own right.\n\nan additional criticism of mine would be the game's performance even on relatively new machines. While the game is advertised as being playable at 60fps on 1080p resolutions, the reality is that the game presently locks itself into certain framerates and resolutions. with 8 gigs of ram, a dual core i7 5500U, and an AMD Radeon R9 M275--capable of getting upwards of 40 frames on fallout 4 at 720p and 50 frames on Warthunder on high settings at 1080p, I get a measly 27-30 frames on HDN;R3 at a locked resolution of 1280x720. Either due to a function of bad drivers or poor port-programming, all of the games in the HDN: R series perform poorly on systems which are well above the listed specifications. This may in part due to the games running heavily off of the CPU and not really using the GPU at full capacity.\n\nIn sum:\n\nPros:\n-more nep\n-shinier prettier graphics\n-more of the parody and cute girls doing cute things that the fans have come to expect.\n-more replayability\n\ncons\n-poor performance graphics-wise\n-combat system has been poorly revised, and fails to add tactical depth\n-annoying achievements to unlock potentially crucial character abilities\n-limited post main-plot-arc content; sequel hook seems like an afterthought\n\nOverall Score:\n8 neps out of 10.","November 20, 2015","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes the game stilll crashes for me on one of the two PC's I played this game on.\n-Too difficult to grind- I said that the grinding was well done,but there are some things that require an insane amount of work and time spent to be achieved. Getting all of the endings is one of those things. (to get them all you need to beat the game 3+ times!)\n-Dungeon and enemy recycling- This is a very big game,which uses recycled maps and enemies to great amount. While I can tolerate the recycling of enemies,since a lot of RPG's and other games do that,I can't tolerate the recycling of the same map for 4+ times.\n-Repetition of tropes- This is an anime-like game and expect to see a lot of stuff you saw a million times before (There is the topic of breast sizes,which the characters talk about quite a handful of times. It may be funny the first or second time,but after that you feel like you are watching you saw already and know the ending of it).\n-Not enough yuri - Moar is required\n\nOverall,this game is/was very fun to play and I will spend more time playing it. Hyperdimension is one of the best RPG's I played and will be a big favorite of mine. Looking forward to more Hyperdimension Neptunia games and I may play the other games aswell.

It's so lighthearted and fun that it keeps me coming back day and day again. Over previous titles, this one follows suit with some additions to the formula. EXE gauge has been eliminated from Rebirth1, instead integrating it into the SP gauge for individual players. The tactics are much more sound and require slightly more thought than before, but then again, I've been playing with all the DLC from the first carried over to here. SO, I am barely halfway through the game, but with 20 party members. The choices are so variable.\n\nIn total, I find the humor and story to be spot-on, and the antagonists are memorable spare for a couple. I can't help but feel sympathy for Copypaste, as I really like the direction he took later on. Also, Anonydeath has been a favorite of mine since I saw the anime. I cannot ever forget his top tier line. "My metal gear may be Solid Snake, but my heart's as maidly as they come." Priceless.\n\nIf you like JRPGs and graphic novels, this may hit a soft spot. Also, Neptune's constant spewing of references, whether you pick up on them all or not, kills me. No joke, I pretty much do that myself all the time. I enjoy this game thoroughly and hope to see the colisseum fixed soon.\n\nI genuinely can NOT wait for Action Unleashed to be released on Steam. Since I don't have a PS Vita I am just dying to play a more active variant of a Neptunia game. AAAAAGH!!!","November 11, 2015","true","82.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The odd,yet very interesting thing is that the girls are all based or represent game consoles or game engines.\n\nPros:\n+Very fun story and dialogue between the characters\n+ Cute and likeable characters\n+4th wall breaking- Adds a certain charm to the game and makes things funnier\n+Battling- You will be doing a lot of battles in which you will be doing the same thing over and over again,but because of the pretty animations and cool Special abilities,it doesn't get boring\n+Design of characters- All of the characters have some things,like ribbons,hairpins or clothing that clues and hints on the game console or engine they are representing\n+Customization- Many accesories and clothing to dress your characters into\n+Do a lot of stuff- There is a lot of grinding to be done and for the most part it is well done\n+Story is easy to get into- Playing the previous Hyperdimension games is not necessary to understand the story,since it pretty light-hearthed\n+Light yuri and ship-teasing\n\nCons:\n-Technical Difficulties- Had to mess a lot with the properties and install some other stuff to get the game to function properly. Sometimes the game stilll crashes for me on one of the two PC's I played this game on.\n-Too difficult to grind- I said that the grinding was well done,but there are some things that require an insane amount of work and time spent to be achieved. Getting all of the endings is one of those things. (to get them all you need to beat the game 3+ times!)\n-Dungeon and enemy recycling- This is a very big game,which uses recycled maps and enemies to great amount. While I can tolerate the recycling of enemies,since a lot of RPG's and other games do that,I can't tolerate the recycling of the same map for 4+ times.\n-Repetition of tropes- This is an anime-like game and expect to see a lot of stuff you saw a million times before (There is the topic of breast sizes,which the characters talk about quite a handful of times. It may be funny the first or second time,but after that you feel like you are watching you saw already and know the ending of it).\n-Not enough yuri - Moar is required\n\nOverall,this game is/was very fun to play and I will spend more time playing it. Hyperdimension is one of the best RPG's I played and will be a big favorite of mine. Looking forward to more Hyperdimension Neptunia games and I may play the other games aswell. Recommending this to everyone who likes RPG,anime stuff or just colorful and fun filled games.\n\n\nPlutia/Iris Heart is the best! :3\n","January 21","true","88.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But then, the point of sale of Neptunia games lies with their charismatic characters and hilarious writing, so I didn't find myself bothered by the deja-vu and neither should you.\n\nSpeaking of Re;Birth 2, if you had the misfortune of playing it, you'll be glad Compile Heart took feedback to heart and castigated their prior game hilariously.\n\nWarning 2: Just as with Re;Birth 2, the last chapter and true ending require you to do some stuff. Fortunately, Re;Birth 3 is way more forgiving than 2 and the conditions are harder to miss. Just read a guide here on the forums and you're golden.\n\nMy only complain: If this game aimed for the early days of the console war... where are all the old discarded consoles?? Where's SNK? Where's Nec? Where's Panasonic? Where are Phillips and Bandai? Where's Mattel? That was one HUGE wasted opportunity. WARNING: COMMENT ON THE GAME's LAST CHAPTER I'd have actually left Planeptune in ruins after Ryghts' bombardment and turned Nep into a wandering Wuxia goof to remain faithful to what happened in the console wars. If they actually went into the part of cell phones in our current Second Videogame Crash, they could have gone all the way while they were at it.\n\n10/10, would Nep again (and probably will, New Game+ is an option).

And yet I still haven't finished the game :'(\nHere's my experience about this game so far\n\n->The gameplay has changed drastically from Re;Birth 2 and here's the reason\n-SP guage is locked at 1000 and also needed for EXE Finisher or EXE Drive which means you really need to think of the     way you are going to use the gauge\n-Challenges are implemented into the game which is originally in Fairy Fencer F (The game and I didn't even played for a long time) that means these challenges are useful for increasing stats in another way,and some of it are rewarded by Plans which can be craft to unlock Combo Slot or Leader Skill ( Or looking under the skirt ;) ) but they are quite grindy and can be annoyed at some point (Trust me I'm tired of grinding stuff since Re;Birth 2)\n-Non-CPU (the goddess) can now be AWAKEND to make them stronger and not useless\n-Hidden Treasure Box is now kinda like Mario's question boxes and not really hidden.....\n-Ranged Character can now attack the target within their RANGE! and not Area of target!\n->The interface also changed drastically but I'm not gonna explain about that :P\n->Plotwise still simple as always "Nonsense and lots of humor" I still laughed so hard in some cutscene\n->Opening Theme is actually pretty good. IMO It's the best out of 3!\n->A lot of side stuff are also added\n->Surprisingly Nearly every DLCs is already in the game woohoo!!\n\nNow for the rating\nStory (I've seen the finished story but not on my own gameplay) 7/10\n->Linear and Predictable\n->Lots of humor\n->A lot of nonsense stuff\nGameplay 7/10\n->SP management is tough at first\n->Unnecessary Challenges grinding\n->Battle system is the same except for the SP\nPresentation 9/10\n->It's just good I really can't say anything about this\nMore Nep-Nep!? Nep-Nep!/10 (This one not count toward my score)\nHere's the score I only give... The completion struggle 5/10 this game is too much for me! I've got enough since Re;Birth 1!\n->OMG the lily grinding is back and really annoyed me A LOT!\n->Too many challenges I'm gonna pass that\n->Only 3 Endings\n->Achievements are pretty easy EXCEPT FOR THE "LOVABLE ..."!\n\nHere's the final score from me It's 7/10 Please don't get me wrong I love the series! but for the sake of the review I need to be honest here,cool?\n\nI still recommend this game just to finish it but not complete it :D\nBuy It!

Story based game (Visual Novel) with a mix of turn based and fighting game... which is surprisingly interesting at times. In fact, I'm not a man who smiles very often, but I did smile a lot due to this game! :D\n- me, 14th of November 2015\n\n<If you don't want to read all the descriptive and narrative stuff... just scroll down to the lists, but maybe that means that you won't like the game since it has a lot of story>\n\nSo, I hope that you have seen the trailer and a few screenshots before reading this review. This game is a Japanese RPG with its iconic characters. It's a Turn-Based game with Fighting animations. The storry is very funny and if you don't like reading the story and you only want mindless slaughter... leave now.  The game itself is a remake of the PS3 version, I don't know the PS3 version of this game but I do know that the rework from the first game and that one had huge differences.\n\nIt's a port from the PSVita and you feel that, the interface wasn't actually remade for PC Gamers so this version still is PSVita, but enhanced with some mouse support and maybe some additional feature. I ended up playing only with the keyboard the entire time, and remapped part of the NumBlock to fit for combat, movement and navegation. I haven't played with a gamepad but I strongly recommend using one (Most likely Xbox 360 ro Xbox One if you don't want to get in trouble). It also has some optimization issues and has an FPS limit, quite low for my taste actually.\n\nThe characters are interesting, the story is funny in a simple way and the combat effects are wonderful and "hype",  I want to be punished by HDD' Plutia: Her Ladyship Iris Heart and you learn a few things... like some body parts in latin or references about the console wars.\n\nThe "Plans" system isn't good in my opinion.... most weapons end up being useless before I can even buy them after crafting.... I tend to have unlocked the next tier default weapons and their stats beat them easily. No gain by crafting most weapons (there are exceptions). Only Armor and Ornaments tend to have some utility in this game... the rest is just for decoration. The game isn't that challenging... and you can't actually change it, I have it in hard mode and I still end up slicing the boss with Neptune's special ability. Once again... optimization issues (laggy). The map design... and the textures (flooring and maps), they could seriously improve A LOT Some BGM could improve (specially the boss music when fighting the fellow goddesses) The SHARES system apparently is totally useless... shares get reset after cutscenes or however you want to call them...  I had 100% shares on planeptune and got set to 10% after a storybreak... AWESOME! (NO) and there are a few more and I will add them once I have meditated a bit.\n\nTL;DR\n+ + +\nInteresting/funny characters.\nNep-nep.\nWonderful skill animations\nFunny & simple story.\nPlenty of outfits to buy and to craft.\nYou may learn new things related to gaming and gaming culture... also maybe japanese culture.\nIt's KAWAII!+++\n\n- - -\nIt's a port and you feel it.\nNot or poorly optimized.\nMap design and textures are poor.\n[Personal objection] It's turn-based.\nMany plans end up being useless.\nThe shares system apparently has no impact... atleast it's not friendly.\nThe game is easy... if you get beaten by an enemy, just grind a bit and you'll beat it in no-time flat... so it usually isn't very challenging.\nSome boss-battle music ruining the atmosphere... It rather makes me laugh than feel epic for beating them. (Vs the fellow Goddesses)\nThe combat system itself is boring in terms of tactics, if not for the animations, I'd say it's too cheap [the system]. Turn-based but without advantages for tactical positioning (except that it's dumb to have all characters right next to eachother, because then AoE's can hit all of them)\n27.99 €? No, that's somewhat overpriced... I'd put it on 20€ so atleast reduce it to 25€.- - -\n\n\nAll in all, I was very happy with the game. I don't regret having bought it.\n\nPS: You want one of those x/10 , right? Well NO!  You can't mathemathically quantify ART, and if you think that you can you're a fool. Go and read or watch Dead Poets Society and you'll understand.","February 21","true","151.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game still runs choppy; can\'t blame it since I\'m running it on a laptop that\'s not fit for gaming.\n\nAnyway the game: I love this game.  There are so many references and the dialogue makes me crack up alot.  New to this game\'s main characters is Plutia who is a sleepy head and can be quite..... never mind; I\'ll let you guys find out about her....other...side. I\'m not too far into the story, but I am loving it so far.","May 31","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
