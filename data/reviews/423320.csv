Now is your time to change one of britains most famous stories.\n\nWhile it differs in quite some things  from the original (naturally), it catches the dramatic events of Arthurs way from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ son to Ruler of the Kingdom in it´s war against the evil Saxon invaders.\nOffering a special treat, Pendragon Rising includes the option to change the whole main cast from male to female, which also presents a different take on the story itself.\n\nWill you strive to make peace via diplomacy wherever possible or be a revengeful ruler without mercy? An opportunistic coward or a true hero, who inspires your folk with brave speeches?\nThe writing is also enjoyable enough to fit the theme, while friends of the classic adventure topic, where you rally your allies together with your close group of friends should feel right at home.\n\nConclusio: This has to be one of my favourite CYoA books up to now, as the atmosphere is really enjoyable, the characters likeable/hateable and it has enough content, to play it more than once, and even get a fully different setting.\n\nRating: 8/10","December 21, 2015","true","4.1"," 59 of 60 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","59","60","0","6"

You've chosen to be a mighty Warrior thus far, then in the set-up for a battle you choose a solid not-too-crafty strategy option - come the finale for that scene you might be shocked to find suddenly your low Leadership and high Warrior scores have completely switched, meaning "challenge their leader one-on-one" puts you on the receiving end of a almighty whupping.\nIt is - as ever - a robust game regardless, I just found this one quite flawed in terms of supporting role-playing.","December 6, 2015","false","1.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","1"

I will say that going into it I didn't expect much as my past experience with text based games was not great, however I am happy that Pendragon Rising was able to reverse that. It had some great reveals and for the most part delivered on the promise of the choices you make being something that matters. It is by no means perfect as sometimes I felt a lack of depth in the alliance building you can engage through diplomacy, but as I've only got 1 playthrough under my belt I bet that there is a lot I missed.\nOver all for the price it asks and the replay value I would suggest to pick this game up you won't regret it.","December 5, 2015","true","6.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Against your will, you get caught up in the war with the Saxons, and unwittingly become the Warleader of your people. Will you be able to gather enough allies to help you stand against the Saxons? And what kind of leader will you be -- a fearless warrior or a more peaceful diplomat? But the most important question of all: will you eventually take the crown for yourself?\n\nPros+ The atmosphere is fantastic; it oozes mythic warriors of long-forgotten times\n+ The author obviously knows a lot about Arthurian lore\n+ The relationships between the characters were superb; I felt really invested in my protagonist's friendships\n+ Despite it being shorter than most CoG games in length, it feels just as rich as the others\n+ You actually get to pick choices that are not "canon" in Arthurian legend\n\nCons- Despite the relationships feeling so real, there was no stat for them per character\n- No save points\n- Limited romance options (be warned of the famous incest relationship if that freaks you out)\n\nGreat game, and I was invested in my character and their relationships right from the start. Recommended for fans of interactive novels with Arthurian themes!\n\nNote: choosing to play as either the male Arthur or the female Arta swaps all the main characters' genders around to match that of the protagonist (except for Morgan/Morgana). Playing as Arta, it was actually really cool to imagine all those massive armies of women marching through old Britain!","January 26","true","2.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

It conveys the atmosphere of a fractured, post-Roman Britain quite well, and although it has some fantastical elements, these are quite subdued for the most part and maintains a more realistic approach.\n\nI found the writing to be engaging and enjoyable, and quite a few of the choices you make are recognized later on the in story, meaning that my decisions actually had some weight to them.\n\nSPOILERS INCOMING!\n\nI also greatly appreciated the fact that the game allowed you some flexibility in terms of the outcome. You do not have to stick to the classic Arthurian story. I actually deliberately avoided becoming king and prefered to work behind the scenes. You are not railroaded into taking the throne. You have the option of stepping down and supporting someone else instead, and this enhances the role-playing element.","December 8, 2015","true","2.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So bear with my rough assessment.\n\nPendragon Rising an old style text-based adventure where nearly, if not every decision you make matters in some way to the story. Unfortunately I missed the age of Text based games, so playing this as my first pure experience was quite fun.\n\nAs expected, the roughly 3 hours (per read-through) of gameplay consists solely of making decisions, leading to what kind of King Arthur/Queen Arta you will be. This consists of these main traits. Leadership, Diplomacy, Warrior, Compassion v. Ruthlessness, Bravado v. Cunning, and Old Religion v. Roman Christianity. But regardless of what kind of ruler you are, you are almost positive to get a rich story.\n\nPros:\n+Great and immersive story.\n+Fun experimentation with choices. Each one truly feels unique.\n+Romances (Or flings) feel pleasantly tasteful.\n+Writing is very strong, I don't recall seeing any spelling errors.\n\nCons:\n-Personally wish the read length was longer.\n-There was a choice or two I found were hard to understand what was meant in context.\n\nTaking everything I've said I strongly recommend this game, with a solid 9/10. If you've got a few hours to spare, or even more for several read-throughs, it's definitely worth the humble price of $4. I'm looking forward to more stories from this developer!","December 6, 2015","true","7.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The writing is very good, the characters memorable, and most noticably the story is paced very well with moments of, yes, conflict and magic, but also intimate spaces where you explore Arthur/Arta's place in the rapidly changing landscape of dark age Britain.\n\nChoosing gender is also a matter of simply choosing which sex is the dominant one in Britain at that time. It is very well implemented, with consequences to being female that feel true to the nature of womanhood while also not diminishing it unecessarily. There are a few gender / name replacement typos, but they are little more than a distraction.\n\nThe game lasted only two or three hours long, but at £2 it's still a steal. I was gripped thoroughly and played it in one sitting. Also there is some sense in replaying it - how would a less diplomatic, more violent Arta turn out? Ultimately I don't want to because I have a very clear vision of my version of Arta, but the choice is still there.\n\nOne downside was the lack of sound. There isn't any sound at all - music or otherwise. I put on a Celtic music playlist and it sufficed, keeping in line with the lore.\n\nFans of dark age mythos and history, or even roleplayers, should really enjoy this. I sincerely hope that I can continue Arta's adventures in the future.","December 8, 2015","true","2.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My main gripe - No saves. There is literally no way to go back and see what a different choice would have done without doing ALL the choices over again. Which means in order to do everything, to see what your decisions do, you need to make your own flowchart, because you can make multiple saves to do divergent paths.\n\n2. My second gripe - Achievements. The achievements are listed as not just being something you successfully did, but as having a "point value". This implies that those points could be used for something. They can't. Period.\n\n3. While you *can* fail, it seems like you can only really fail at the end, or very close to it. Even intentionally making the stupidest of decisions will leave you alive for quite some time.\n\nDon't take these things as me saying the game is horrible, it isn't.

My main problem is the lack of choices, now matter what it seems this or that is the outcome, sure there are outcomes that you can only get if you do this and that, but the majority of choices have the same outcome wether you choose choice one two or three.","December 7, 2015","false","6.8"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

I admit to having expected bit much.\n\nI call this sort of genre fantasy-war-trash. The "romantic" options are so out of place in the game that I wonder if they were added as an after-thought. If you choose to play as a heroine, the story is suddenly about amazon woman warriors with men being the weaker sex, who follow their leader women from the sidelines. Who wants to read something like that? I speak solely for myself of course, but I thought this change in plot was of very bad taste. Where was the part of princess? Medieval times! This game could have been much better.\n\nThe story was short and the plot was kept rather narrow no matter what decisions you made. I tried all sort of things, because I really tried to like this and not to regret purchasing it. I cannot think of anybody whom to recommend it.","December 9, 2015","false","7.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It is a good game, however, like others have mentioned, there is a lack of choices and replayability, something that is expected in a choose your own adventure type game.

The plot is enjoyable however, especially if immersiveness and general setting/story is of more value to you than just sheer action and bad-assery.
