While I've regretted buying some of them, NONE of them hit me like this one. $40 down the drain. If it's ever on sale for $5...DON'T BUY IT!\n\nLet me just state that I'm one of the biggest Dead Island fans on the planet. Spent much of my life playing DI 1 and Riptide on consoles and PC. So I essentially bought the games twice each with no regrets. I've even spent plenty of hours on DI.E. So yea, I'm a fan of the franchise, but this installment is starting to make me question Deep Silver (something I NEVER thought I would do). Why they would let the Dead Island name go to crap like this and actually publish something like this is beyond my understanding.\n\nGraphics/Sound: Looks like it was meant for tablets and smart phones. The voice acting is so bad, it's impossible to even try and immerse yourself.\n\nContols: Combat is terrible, stealth is terrible, gunplay is terrible. It's all just terrible.\n\nStory: I could not bring myself to finish this game. I tried and tried and pushed through as much as I could. Aside from the technical side of things being sub par, the story itself is anything but enticing. I wanted to know the origins of the virus, but not like this. I'd rather not know than waste any more time on this..."game".\n\nYou've been warned, Dead Island fan or not, stay away from this one.","December 7, 2014","false","3.5"," 469 of 540 people (87%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","87","469","540","26","31"

We play as Cliff. Him and his two friends Linda and Devan travel to a island Narapela to discover what happened in Banoi.\n\nThe game takes a different approach in the story telling department. The story takes center stage and it adds mystery elements making you question what's real and what's fake.\n\nFocusing on the story is this games biggest weakness. The story is a total mess and it's just all over the place and not to mention it doesn't fit into the franchise.\n\nThe gameplay is horrible. It's mostly a stealth game where you can go loud and it becomes into a beat em up. You have the same stamina bar that's in the original Dead Island games.  The stealth in this game doesn't work. The game expects you to go around the zombies or stealthily get to your objective, in reality the game spawns zombies in front of you so it's impossible to go around them and they spot you even when you are behind them.\n\nThe game has one thing I enjoy and that is the cell shaded look. I love the art style, but I can't appreciate it fully because of the terrible character models and the texture pop ins that happen way too often.\n\nThis game is also quite difficult. Zombies can take you out in two hits and checkpoints are far from each other, so you need to beg to God you have a run which doesn't mess you up.\n\nThe game took me 4 hours to finish. It's incredibly short and there's no replay value what so ever. So don't expect a second playthrough.\n\nIn the end I might say Escape Dead Island is one of the worst games I have ever played. The story is horrible, the gameplay is boring, the stealth is broken and not to mention the game is beyond broken. There is no reason to own this game cause it's a horrible. It's not even worth owning for hardcore fans of Dead Island.\n\nFinal Rating:\n\n2/10 - Do not buy\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 9, 2015","false","6.3"," 205 of 232 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","205","232","8","4"

Yes, I've read the negative reviews, and decided check it out myself.\n\nIt has often been noted (negatively) that this is not an Open World game, and for that reason, it's a bad game. Well, Resident Evil and Silent Hill weren't Open World, either. A lot of backtracking was involved with those games. Did those excellent titles suddenly become bad games? No, I don't think so.\n\nYes, EDA is quite linear whereas RE and SH were quite complex. But you know what - I enjoyed it nonetheless. There's a lot to be discovered if you leave the designated path. I'm still struggling with two achievements.\n\nAnother criticism that has been noted is that there's no multiplayer option. Folks, this is an action adventure with a fixed storyline. It's 100% focused on telling a background story, just like good old adventure titles. Could you imagine a multiplayer Monkey Island? This story is Cliff-centric. Introducing other playable characters just wouldn't make sense.\n\nAs I said, I haven't played the other titles yet (but I will) and as such don't know how the game blends in with the series, but as a standalone, linear, Metroidvania-style action adventure, it is good entertainment.\n\nMaybe I'm biased because I paid 5 bucks when it was on sale.\n\nAnyway, I enjoyed it!","May 26, 2015","true","43.2"," 238 of 301 people (79%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","79","238","301","10","2"

For me, the controls are fine, I like the graphics style and I don't mind how linear the game is most of the time. Not every game can be open world and not every game should be open world.\n\nSo what kills it for me? It's basically two things. For one, the placement of the cutscenes is just awful. When you die, it often makes you re-watch unskipable cutscenes again. Also, collectibles do not save after respawing at a checkpoint, so you have to pick them up again. That's just BS! The second thing is the very last level of the game, which just throws wave after wave of difficult enemies at you - with barely anything between them. This is by far the hardest part of the game and I hated it, because it is just extremely poor and lazy designed. It's the same problem that Deadpool has, where they couldn't come up with something better at the end of the game than throwing more and more hard enemies at you just to hinder you from progressing faster.\n\nThe last level of Escape Dead Island almost completely ruined the whole experience for me - which was otherwise pretty good I have to say. What a shame. With that being said, I cannot get myself to really recommend this game, although I liked it quite a bit for the most part.","March 5","false","9.8"," 61 of 70 people (87%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","87","61","70","5","6"

In addition to the main game and semi-sequel, we’ve also got a proper sequel in the works, a MOBA, and now a third-person action adventure game. Escape Dead Island is the latter. Swedish Fatshark are at the helm this time. The result is a more story-driven game. This franchise seems to be cursed, so this game comes with its share of problems as well. The audiovisual presentation is all over the place. It’s not really a bad-looking game, but the cel-shading is so overdone that the game looks extremely simple at times. One can wonder what it would look like if the cartoony filter was removed. The music is alright, but the voice acting is generally subpar. And once again, we’ve got a zombie game that takes itself far too seriously. So you can’t just wave it off and call it “unintentionally cheesy”, either.\n\nMost striking of all, is the complete departure from Dead Island’s core mechanics. No longer will you roam an open world, freely craft and upgrade your own weapons that you use to hack up and loot zombies. This is more or less linear experience, where you hardly find any weapons at all, and there are no RPG-elements to be found. Looking at the screenshots, you’ll be forgiven for thinking it’s some sort of interactive story á la Telltale fare. It certainly is more story-focused than any previous Dead Island games, but there’s much more actual gameplay here than in a Telltale game; but the gameplay is so simplistic and repetitive, you’ll wish there was none at all.\n\nThe story presented here isn’t all that bad. It’s nothing prize-worthy, but it definitely taps into some interesting things with its character gradually going insane. And it satisfyingly ramps up towards the end, too. You, as the player, will start second-guessing what’s actually happening and what’s only in protagonist Cliff’s head. It reminded me of Spec Ops: The Line; it’s got that same sort of “The gameplay is so mundane but I really want to see what happens next in the story!” vibe. Only here, the story isn’t nearly as good. And the gameplay is even less rewarding. And at nearly twice the price compared to what Telltale charge for their much better adventure games, Escape Dead Island is a damn hard sell. I’d only recommend it if you get it on a sale. And even then, you might end up bored.","January 7, 2015","false","5.5"," 85 of 118 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","85","118","2","0"

Visually it preserves vibrancy of a tropical island but the zombies lack menace. The rigid tropical island contains too many arbitrary barriers, and far too much backtracking through agonizing passageways. The story is vague and generic, easier to ignore and hardly necessary for fans of the franchise. There is a general inelegance to all aspects involved with killing zombies too, as the melee combat is clunky, stealth is flawed and the shooting is inconsistent. As a spinoff, it brings nothing compelling to the franchise while reducing the enjoyable aspects. Unfortunately there is no easy cure to the problems in Escape Dead Island, and future games in the franchise should avoid direct contact.\n\nRead full review[www.newgamenetwork.com]","July 18, 2015","false","7.3"," 118 of 172 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","118","172","8","0"

Most people had bad things to say about it, but I think that has more to do with expectations than anything else.  First, THIS IS NOT DEAD ISLAND!  Yes, it is a pre-quel, but that is all it shares with the series.  This has different graphics and game mechanics.  This is like a much more interactive Telltale game.  You don't upgrade your weapons or characters like Dead Island and it's not open world and very linear.\n\nFor what it is, a story driven adventure game with somewhat clunky combat, I enjoyed it quite a bit.  You take on the role of Cliff Calo, who, with the help of two friends, sets off for Narapela to find out what kind of experiments are going on there.  You explore the island trying to find the mystery behind the zombies.  Combat consists of melee and guns, with melee being my preference.  As you go further in the story, you open up more areas of the island and discover upgraded weapons, some of which allow to enter previously unaccessible buildings/areas.  The story builds up pretty nicely.\n\nNow, I will say that the end of the game is probably my least favorite part.  The story gets progressively crazier and unbelievable (even in a world with zombies) and the combat jumps in difficulty in the last two missions. Shoot, in the last mission it's like a completely different game with the bosses.  I lucked out that the game sort of glitched and had the last boss stuck on some rocks so I could just unload my pistol and kill him.  So, be aware that the end is not as satisfying as one would wish.\n\nAlso, I stumbled into the free Underwater Labs DLC story when I thought I was completing a different game mission and it turned out to be one of my favorite missions of the game.  So I would highly recommend you be sure to find the entrance to it and do that mission.\n\nOverall:  6 zombie headshots out of 10","June 7, 2015","true","11.4"," 58 of 84 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","58","84","3","0"

Now this isn't necessarily a bad this except you will end up traversing annoyingly long corridors many times over and quite often these paths are completely empty, oh did I mention long? What becomes extremely annoying is that often there is some sort of sound byte or even medium sized cutscenes after a save point. Guess what you don't get to skip each and every time you respawn.

Depends on your taste.\n\n+Good graphics\n+Good soundtrack\n+Good free DLC\n+Collectibles are..alright\n\nWhile not being 100% disastrous it is also not too far from that point, and that's a shame because it has potential for something more.\n\nAnd no, I didn't fall into the trap of expecting it to be like Dead Island or Riptide. I knew, or at least thought I knew, what I was getting into. I knew this is NOT RPG, I knew that it is mainly an 'action' title, with a small map, short length, etc..\nAnd these are true, and personally I have no problem with them. It's perfectly alright, and ever since I saw the trailer when the game was about to come out, it got my attention. Therefore I quickly grabbed it when it was finally on sale.\n\nWhile I guess you could say this game is worth at least those 4 bucks, and you'd be right, I still feel my time was terribly wasted.\nThis game is simply not all that fun, and, sometimes it does so in a cruel way.\nGameplay-wise, you would mainly run around some other zombie-infested island - a mostly linear experience - advancing with the story and smashing zombies along the way.\n\nAs I said earlier the island's area is relatively small, although appropriate for the game's type and length. YET somehow the developers arranged the game in a way that makes you BACKTRACK A WHOLE LOT. I Hate backtracking. And playing through the game, you'd find yourself walking through the same areas, threading the same caves, climbing the same ladders, using the same ropes, crounching under the same foliage, over, and over, and over, again.\nDid I miss something?\n\nOh yes, you won't JUMP over anything.\nOur hero is capable of sending zombies to their ultimate deaths but cannot jump.\nThis may sound like a minor detail, and if the game was done correctly it could have been. But doing all this backtracking just to run around some annoying not-too-giant obstacles just makes you think WHY CAN'T YOU JUMP CLIFF? WHY????\n\nThe combat, which is a big part of the game, won't save things either, for the simple reasons of it being repetitive and monotonous, but above all, way too laggy! The controls would always respond in delay, the combat mechanics feel flawed and clunky.\nAlso, our hero would die SO FAST. No matter how much medkits you'd collect along the way, (and these would tell yo that you've raised your max health, yeah right!), you'll just keep dying quickly, without even realizing what's happening!\nAt first these buggy mechanics are bearable, but later in the game on the parts which are meant to be more challanging, it becomes a pain in the butt.\nSwitching weapons is also not too quick or responsing, and the result is a combat which is not flowing at all, and you'd pray to end it as quickly as possible.\nYes, you will pray. Or just quit. Or just break your computer, as I almost did.\n\nThere are also MANY collectibles throughout the island. usually these are logs\recordings\etc you'd have lying around and well hidden, there are also snapshots which you can take with your camera. I actually found this aspect nice and enjoyable, but it grew tired soon enough, and didn't make up for the rest of the game.\n\nThe one thing which really kept me from leaving this game mid-way to rot in the depths of my "Don't Like" category on Steam, was the story. And as much as it hurts to say, it wasn't too good or worth it, as well.\nIt is very twisted, which is actually a good thing in my opinion. It is also very bland at some points, which is neither good or bad for me, and can be easily made into superb plot with just one single strong ending.\nThere wasn't.\nI guess the concept was alright and a somewhat original twist to the classic zombie stories (Some evil corporation spreads the virus because it wants to rule the world\it is just plain stupid), but still, the story is not getting too clear throughout the game. For many of the events, you'll never figure out if they ACTUALLY happened or are simply a fruit of our hero's rather limited imagination.\nThe ending doesn't properly close the game, there are many holes and questions unanswered, and it is simply not justifying the time spent on.\nNo need to say the chatacters have no depth or any development (storywise).\n\nMy expectations were high because this game is supposed to be "the missing link between Dead Island and Dead Island 2" as the description said. But it didn't really surprise or bring anything good. Oh, and there's one very notable connection to the previous titles: (again, storywise) Xian Mei (hope I wrote that correctly) would be our guest star, her purpose not too clear, and while on previous games she seemed like the kindest person on earth, here she's mostly an annoying ♥♥♥♥♥ with an annoying accent.\nNot being racist here.\n\nSo, there it is, with a heavy heart I would definitely NOT recommend this game, unless you like torturing yourself. There are some bright sides which are worth mentioning, although they fail to save the game from being what it is.\n\nThe graphics are actually pretty good, not too demanding and not too fancy but has a cool comic-style which is very refreshing to the series and I always like to see in video games.\n\nThe soundtrack is splendid! Feels like a waste for this game, but, it really keeps the atmosphere in a good place, very dramatic and tense, very fitting, very epic, simply great!\n\nUnfortunately, these make the game look like a nice package while the inside is an utter mess.\n\nThe Underwater Labs is also worth mentioning, for being a free DLC, it is quiet good and mostly enjoyable. While it doesn't have much connection to the main story, it would take you aside to an hour or two of something...else. It is probably the only portion of the game which was actually creepy for me. There was a special emphasis on sneaking around instead of storming your enemies, it was bizzare and twisted, tense, and, well, good. Until the game mechanics ruined it and it's final section almost made me quit the game for good.\n\nMaybe I should have.","December 4, 2015","false","13.4"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

The game will let you travel a very long ways and fight many enemies before throwing you against a enemy with crazy strength with no save inbetween. If you die you will restart at the very beginning and any collectibles you got will also reset.\n\nI also feel like this game struggles too much to try and implement jumpscares, which dead island was never about.

You wont find it here in this game. The zombie fights in the game gets repetitive with just swinging for the fences until you run out of stamina. The story isn't all that well either. You are a group of teens looking for a story about the zombie outbreak. And then after that, somewhere down the line the story leaves you wonder what is real and what isn't, and not in a good way. As for the last boss fight, there were times in the rest of the game where I had more of a challenge than the boss. Just run and gun it. And for bugs, as soon as I started playing not 5 minutes into the game I ran through a door just to fall out of the world. Should have took that as a warning for the rest of the game. And when you get to the end of the game you see what looks like the game was either rushed or the creators lost interest in it with dialogs running together with you trying to figure out which part is happening now. I liked the graphics at first where it looks like a comic book. But after a while it just runs together with lights flickering everywhere and rooms being tilted where you have to turn your head just to get through the level.

What results is a short hobbled version of a grander planned experience. Deep Silvers lack of faith radiates sharply with a complete lack of advertisement for the game leaving my discover of its release solely to pure luck.\n\nThe game is short, roughly 3-4 hours if you don't care at all about the collectables. I do, obsessively, so with them you can grind out an additional 2-3 hours. During which you'll be treated to a 3D metroid style world with hidden weapons, collectibles, and health upgrades galore. Through the collectibles and pictures you take with the camera you'll receive the majority of the back-story, of the virus's lore, the villains motivation, essentially everything.\n\nOn the other hand, the main story  is hobbled, short, and feels salvaged. It and its characters would be entirely forgettable without the flushing out the lore collectibles provides them. Without spoiling the ending, I must say it doesn't resolve anything, but there is a hidden ending. Unlocking it is as mysterious as unlocking the 4 bunkers in game, and help for doing so as of this writing is entirely none existent.\n\nGameplay wise the game does well. There is a simple stealth system that you will rarely use, but the main combat mechanics (Melee and guns) flows fluidly, with each blow results in a reaction from any creature. Once timing is perfected for the harder enemies they're easy although time consuming to dispatch. Dodge mechanic is responsive and a pure requirement for combat. Without its use enemies will auto lock onto you, rarely missing.\n\nStealth is deadly, especially after recovering the knife allowing for instantaneous takedowns. Sneaking up on unaware enemies allows for stealth kills, dropping the enemy instantly regardless of class. It is extremely satisfying to get a higher tier mutant this way. Unfortunately level design often hinders stealth, levels are often narrow and compact leaving little to no room to sneak behind enemies with only a few exceptions. Important linear areas typically boil down to combat only, with a few opportunities for thinning the horde.\n\nAesthetically the games comic book, heavy black lines and pop up sound effects give the game a fantastically fun feel. Hit walls, sound effect, hit enemies, sound effect, steam coming out of a pipe, sound effect. Without a doubt the sound effect popup were my favorite feature. Details are not skimped on, characters are detailed, while mutants/infected have a few variations are largely the same class to class.\n\nI had fun with Escape Dead Island, but what stops me from recommending this game is the lack of conclusion it has. It's something that is nearly impossible explain without spoiling what happens after the end so spoiler warning : The game circles back to the beginning of its own events. There are hints that something else is going on, but answers and satisfaction are relegated to the hidden ending. Price wise I feel good about the game, but I got it last minute prepurchase while on sale, giving access to Dead Island 2 beta and a first issue of the Dead Island comic. Without these perks I'd wait till the game hits around $20 to pick it up.\n","November 23, 2014","false","14.7"," 33 of 55 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","33","55","0","0"

Combat happens from a 3rd view perspective and attacks require more timing, however attacking is fluid enough once adapted to it. Stealth is a main component in this title and is implemented in a simple but efficient manner.\n* there are no RPG related elements like currency, custom weapons, item collection, leveling up, etc.\n* the game is more linear as in you need to get certain items and complete objectives in an order so the next area can be unlocked.\n\n"Escape" is an entirely different game experience from the previous titles which I found quite enjoyable and welcome. The game offers a lot of background information into the epidemic and some of the characters involved thus filling in some of the gaps. I recomend this game but be aware it does not play or feels like the previous Dead Island titles so do not purchase if you are expecting something close to the earlier installments or you might be dissapointed.\n\nEdit: deleted previous "Edit" note.","November 19, 2014","true","18.4"," 75 of 136 people (55%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","55","75","136","4","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/recommended/226560/","mokushiroku","Moku","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mokushiroku/","694 products in account","[Update] Having played this game for some hours into its "New Game Plus", I've become more and more frustrated with its clunky controls, uninterruptable animations (I was blocked from attacking for 8 seconds, while being attcked, while he took his gasmask off then equipped his melee), bad (or lack of) animation, hugely spaced checkpoints, and overpowered enemies. Play this game through once with an open mind and you might like it, but for me at this point, my review has changed from positive to negative. There are simply better, more fun to play games out there, and I'm deeply sickened at the thought of having to do the final boss again just to get 100% (two full playthroughs is an acheivement).\n\n[Original] Escape from Dead Island is not a bad game. It isn't great, it might not even be good, but it does what it set out to do competently. Do NOT get this game because you liked the main Dead Island games - this is nothing like that. I can't stress enough that this is NOT a horror game.\n\nEfDI is a metroidvania-esque character action game, having you explore an island from set A-to-B points using whatever item you just got to access new areas. There are numerous collectables, some hidden behind item-locked rooms that will require backtracking to get, and an extensive (and good) bonus mission thanks to the free DLC.\n\nDespite hitting a progression-blocking bug 15 minutes into the game (the next room simply didn't load, leaving a void, which inexplicably corrected itself after a system reboot), I have since spent a fair number of hours - dare I say it - having fun in this colourful universe of zombies and constant scouring to find goodies.\n\nThe combat is basic: Fast combo; Heavy attack (and I mean heavy, it takes 3 seconds to swing); Push (I think this is overlooked by most - it stuns any enemy out of their attack pattern!); and Dodge (which requires surprisingly precise timing to actually avoid an attack). Most of the time you'll be dispatching basic zombies with two lights and a heavy or 3-4 lights, or a Run-Push, which knocks down most enemies in one hit for an instant kill. One thing this game excels is making weapons feel good - the guns sound satisfyingly hefty and the melee really feels like it has force behind it (though they all use the same animations, which is odd for the Katana).\n\nStealth is managed quite nicely, using a large "!" that fills to indicate how aware enemies are of you. For basic zombies it's pretty leniant, for the advanced ones, less so, but all the more satisfying for it. The main flaw of this system is the requirement to crouch to stealth and stand to stealth kill - the game is VERY fiddly with where it will allow you to stand up. More than once I've snuck up on a zombie and mashed 'A', only to be given a "Blocked from standing up" prompt and for their alert meter to fill up.\n\nOne thing this game does very nicely, along with its cel-shading shaders, is the inclusion of 'insanity effects'. Cliff seems to be losing his mind throughout the game, which allows for some very bizzare effects to occur and keep things interesting. That said, Cliff is a fairly unlikeable jabroni, with his chocolate ice-cream hair, 'deep' tattoo, and recurring "I've got this" attitude. He's certainly not the worst character I've ever seen, but the three main student/investigative reporter characters fit right in with the FarCry 3 universe of rich, entitled daddy-issue trash. I mean, Cliff steals his daddy's yacht so he can get a 'scoop' to secretly win his affection.\n\nSpeaking of scoops, this game prominently features the use of a camera to take photos, which I was not at all aware of coming in to it. Now, this is entirely optional, purely for collectables, but it fits with the character and makes areas a little more interesting as you frequently flip to camera-mode to spont any new glowing objects to capture. This feature has its downsides though - for example, whenever you enter a new area, crates and beer bottles begin glowing again despite them already being captured. Cliff also includes a terrible one-liner with each, though only 10% of these are voiced.\n\nThis game hasn't received any awards for writing, and for good reason. Characters are mostly one-dimensional stereotypes ("the artist", "the reporter", "the mysterious badass") and references to other games are frequent and unfunny. Cliff is probably the worst voiced character of them all, often reading lines like he doesn't understand the context and sounding like he just solved a crossword rather than forcing a door open.\n\nThe graphics are actually really good, beleive it or not. The cel-shaded filter works really well to give you that comic-book feel, along with the little sound-effect pop-ups when you do anything noisy (though "scrounge" as a sound-effect is one of my favourites). Animation on the other hand, is not. None of the characters facially emote during animated cutscenes and Cliff doesn't even open his mouth when talking out of one. The game also has its issues with shadows and the transition between the ambient lighting of different areas, but that's hardly uncommon. The drawn cutscenes are stunning however, acheiving a level of 3D space using drawn art I've rarely seen before - truly beautiful and nicely styalised (though the characters can look fairly different between the different cutscenes).\n\nA major weakness of this game is the lack of an inventory. There is absolutely no way for you to remind yourself what key items you have, such as keycards, without going up to a door to see whether the prompt is highlighted or not. This uselessness travels over to the map, which is by far the worst map I've ever seen in a videogame. The map is non-interactable, an abstract representation with no points of reference besides a numbered list of locations, and absolutely no help if you're trying to remember where a certain previously-locked area was.\n\nSo, in summation, this is not a brilliant game. You probably won't play it again in the future, but you might have fun like me while you do. The combat is frustrating and can turn against you fairly quickly, but you are usually given all the options you need to survive one way or another (upon repeated deaths ammo spawns next to you), just make sure you scour the levels for Medkits, which permamently increase your max health (you'll need it). The nice art, Cliff's sanity and numerous collectables keep things interesting while you venture through this fairly uninspired, but serviceable game.","January 10","false","18.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

The first half of the game leads you to believe that it is a good game, then the last half is a mix of heavy backtracking over places you've been already two or three times prior, and a unbelievably long dream sequence with extremely frustrating fights. It took me no more than a few tries even on the hardest fight, but that doesn't mean they can't be horribly frustrating. When you have two spinning zombies, three spitters, 4 normal ones, and each time you kill a spinner a new one pops up, yea it gets a little frustrating lol. But the entire dream sequence at the end game as a whole is probably the biggest reason this game is a failure, that and the game has no rpg progression system and only 3 weapons in the whole game. A rpg skill gain system wouldn't have helped anyway because the game is just too linear. The last quarter or so of the game is a horribly long confusing dream sequence that is just not that fun because when it starts, you realize that from this moment on the game you were playing is gone and this dream sequence is going to lead you to the end. A huge disappointment of the last 1/4 of the game or longer. It made it all feel like everything I had accomplished, weapon upgrades and story progression, were all for naught. They copped out and threw the story in the gutter at the end into a nonsensical bunch of unentertaining crap.\n\nThe sounds and music are good, the graphics are good, and the game runs very smoothly.

Although it plays differently to the FPS original Dead Island games and the MOBA Epidemic. This is more centred around a story and sees you not only trying to survive the island but your own sanity with strange events being triggered, think of a cartoony Evil WIthin. I haven't completed the game yet so don't know the full story. Although this is good as stops me from spoiling it for you.\nYou get to use melee and ranged weapons and you will find various key items that allow you travese more and more of the Island. Sometimes this will make you go back to previous visited areas that were inaccessible before, so make notes as you go. The graphics although more cartoony than the other games look nice, as a fan of Cel Shaded graphics. The story will keep you interested and a few familar faces will pop into the game as you progress. I am over half way through and don't think this is an overly long game, although the Free DLC adds significant new content. However, if you are an achievement hunter, there is always plenty to go back for. I got the game on sale and think the original asking price was way to high, but if you can get at a fair price and are a fan of Dead Island games I would recommend giving this a whirl.","March 18, 2015","true","5.3"," 29 of 55 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","29","55","3","2"

One only needs to understand that it isn't a "real" Dead Island sequel nor Dying Light-type game. It is somewhat different thing and it can be enjoyable even if it lacks the complexity and depth of these titles. There is no real open world, only a feigned one. As in some older games, you cannot enter every area at first and you need to return to some places later (but I don't consider this a fault).\n\nCONS:\n- too expensive at 20 euros  (and it was horrendously expensive earlier), but when on a 50% sale, I think it's worth the money;\n- the character cannot jump nor walk over high ledges (it means you cannot fall over ledges, but hey, being not able to jump over a bench or table?);\n- the character cannot stand up from the crawl when too close to obstacles, and it spoils many "silence-kill" opportunities;\n- stupid old-console-like saving system;\n- voice acting - too exaggerate as for my taste, at least in the recordings you found during the gameplay.\n\nPROS (IMHO):\n- very nice, comic-style graphics (event if some textures ARE ugly);\n- funny ideas as visible words depicting sounds (consistent with the comic-style look);\n- a deeper insight into the original Dead Island incident (not too original though);\n- good music and sound;\n- nice character design;\n- just right difficulty (I hate games that are too hard, I don't have the time for many repeated attempts, I have my job and family to care for ;) ).","March 27, 2015","true","9.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I suppose it needed that banner flagship to get noticed on here but the similarities to that series stops at the name, barring a brief cameo from an original character and the occasional namedropping of Banoi.  You're not even on Banoi in this game!  Instead you're on another island nearby which has suffered from a similar affliction of the walking dead.  If this had been some new zombie-flavoured IP I think it would have a positive or very positive rating on here.\n\nIn a nutshell, it's a exploration-stealth-zombie-splat-adventure-a-thon.  People do rag on the combat and I can understand where they're coming from.  Sometimes, in particular, during heated close combat engagements where I'd be running away from whatever is currently trying to eat my face, all the while hurriedly reloading, I'd then spin round quickly to fire from the hip and I'd always find myself firing slightly to the right of where I intended and how the screen seemed to imply I was facing.  This led to me often missing things at point-blank-range.  Deliberate aiming as the horge descends on you works much better.  And the stealth kills I felt were a treat, having to stalk up on your prey, always on edge wondering whether I would be spotted by my target zombie or one of his buddies and turned into some prime chowder.  Not only that but shooting zombies from afar with your silent pistol as the rest looking around all confused was also very satisfying.  The melee combat was the standard quick button mashing affair and always came down to the two keystrokes of attack/dodge (don't even bother with the slow heavy attack).  By and large I think smashing away was easier than it needed to be but occasionally the close combat experience would just click and you'd find yourself swatting back zombies on all sides and finding yourself thoroughly enjoying every second!\n\nThe art style really works.  The cell-shaded visuals reminded me strongly of Borderlands and everything was bright, colorful and easily identifiable.  Of particular note are the gorgeous comic-book style stills between scenes.  The cartoonish aesthetic really was a welcome change of pace from the gritty depressiveness of the original series.\n\nStealthily exploring the island and picking up countless nuggets of backstory was where the game really shone.  Not only that but the storytelling was far more engaging than the original series.  Think spec ops/heart of darkness by way of the zombie apocalypse, drawing you ever deeper into the protagonist's madness.  Also, there was a gameplay impacting point to exploration with the inclusion of medikits scattered far and wide.  Though weirdly upon pick up the screen would flash up '+1' or '+3' health increase.  There was no indicator of health in any numeric/visual form beyond the standard blood staining around the screen border upon taking damage so what these numbers meant is anyone's guess.  You did at least notice over time that you could take an extra slash or two from the island bestiary.\n\nThere were a few other niggles and oddities, like the fact your torch doesn't alert zombies at all.  Would have been nice and a bit more realistic to have to turn it off to sneak up on the undead.  Also, the number of times I wished I had a grenade...  And I thought the dialogue was a bit odd and stiff to begin with but as it went on I got used to it and began to really enjoy the character's interaction and plaintive despair from the main character as he went further round the bend.  The cartoonish style of the game also helps smooth the dialogue a good bit and makes it fit.\n\nIn short, if you love zombies and want a break from standard FPS zombie blasing, and you enjoy some good old fashioned exploration and stealth killing with a swiftly ramping up in stakes story then buy this now.  And definitely pick it up if it's on sale!\n\n\n","May 8, 2015","true","12.4"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","10","18","2","0"

It is a linear 3-rd person single player action adventure game that is heavy on stealth and melee combat.  You can use guns but they make noise which typically results in you getting swarmed and killed.   Taken individually, eveything here has been done better elsewhere but, taken as a whole, the result is a decent game that could have been much better with a few more months in the oven.\n\nDepending on how much time you spend searching around for hidden supplies the game is probably anywhere from 6-12 hours of game play.

Mind you, if you have played Dead Island, you still won't understand it. You spend the first part of the game trying to save a random chick, but then she dies - or does she. She then spends the last half of the game being a nagging shrew - or are you dreaming that. You try and chase down the other person you landed on the island with - a guy, only to find that he may or may not actually exist. Then your dad shows up in a helicopter, but then essentially tells you to get stuffed, and flies away without picking you up. You then have a lightning strike, and a hoard of zombies show up. Throughout the game, you continually phase in and out of - well, something. Maybe an alternate dimension? Who knows - and who cares. The developers were obviously high as balls when they made this game. Still, if you liked Dead Island (I did), then you may as well get this game, it attempts to explain how Dead Island became Dead Island.\n\nSome parts of the game force you into third person shooter mode, which is unfortunate, as the game is not setup to be a shooter. The graphics are quite nice. Characters? Well, you will either care about them or not (more likely the latter). The enemies with the long bladed hands are EXTREMELY annoying as they can (and will) deflect everything you can attack with (melee weapons and bullets).

I would recommend this game to anyone right now, but preferably get it during a sale when it goes cheaper. I only got mine because of the pre-purchase offer for the Dead Island 2 beta.\n\nThis game really demonstrates a story quite unique in comparison to other Dead Island games. In the previous installments, the games were heavily focused around story-based RPG's, which were quite enjoyable. Escape Dead Island takes away some of those elements and leaves it down to the basic linear story, which in my opinion, is still quite enjoyable. The atmosphere in the game so far gives off a dark mood of a mystery so far in the beginning. (I can't yet explain the mood for the rest of the game yet since I have only gotten a couple of hours into it.)\n\nIt may not seem or feel like a typical Dead Island game, however it is very unique in its own way.

The ending totally disappointed me. Overall the script does not contribute to the original Dead Island serie.  First said us the epidemy started in Banoi, now resulted was Narapela. Frankly, when I saw Xian Mei, I thought that will be good connection with the events of Dead Island but not, not any really.\nGame looks nice and has good features of interest though. My other problem and that also made me to regret of buy it, were very annoying graphics issues: constant flashes of white light all the game, blinking screen, I got it totally white or sometimes red or green, which issues I could not solve with any driver for video card I tried or with any combinations of settings in proper game and in Nvidia control panel. Perhaps my card just does not  "like" the game.\nDo not buy it for this excessive price at least. I found it a bit cheaper but even though was too much.\nYou see 0,1 h in 2 weeks I played this game.

I almost didn't buy this due to the bad feedback and I can ensure you don't listen to most of the feedback's mostly just trolls who hate anything that doesn't meet to their perspective. The game is Cartoonish, you do need a decent Rig to play this at high Graphics, The Graphics isn't bad considering its cartoonish, its like Team fortress 2 Graphics. But in a good way to me, I love the Comic like details put in place of this game, some people will love it, some people will hate it forever, similar to the Cartoonish Zelda game also. It has basic Weapon Schematics in the game, basic Shoot em up and Melee'r weapons nothing fancy, But love the Upgraded Weapons. The game isn't easy, But once you get the hang of the controls, which I customized mine, your good to go, So don't listen to all the haters if your willing to add this game to your Dead Island Franchise, To me I think its worth the add-on, and I think its a fun game.","May 24, 2015","true","13.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

I still recommend to try if it's in good discount, it's very different to Dead Island but it still has some good moments.\n\nGood:\n- Some brilliant prank and surprise scene like your daily nightmare rendered on the screen, it's weird level close to the famous Silent Hill (but not the monster design)\n- Nice island design, some environments really disturbing like the under water lab\n- Auto saved check point and auto regenerate health\n- Strong start story mystery settings\n\nBad:\n- What I hate most, the Ending! Not enough explanations for what happened on all story characters, even I don't know they're real person or some kinds of ghosts.\n- Too few weapons variation, you won't even get the grenade, you got a screw driver from start to the end insteads\n- Too few zombie or monster variation. Very fixed attack pattern, you die bacause their health is much more than player only\n- Too many  un-necessary croaching tunnels areas and backtracking\n- Pathetic range weapon power, I can't accept or believe how weak is a shotgun in this game, even weaker than a fire axe! Zombie can BLOCK THE SHOTGUN SHELLS USING ARMS AND TAKES NO DAMAGE!! And fire axe actually is the strongest weapon in this game after level up\n- Ugly character textures, only some close up scene they make it little better for the media\n- Xian Mei is non playable\n\nVerdicts:\nAfter first 3 hours of game progress you can uninstall this game if you have somethings better to play, just watch other's walkthough to see the crappy ending and celebrate you didn't repeat the same mistake the uploader did.\n\nScore:\n6/10","November 15, 2015","true","8.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

This is on the basis that while it is technically worse than Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide, Escape Dead Island does not take 40-60 hours to complete, and it does not require roping in three friends who will disown you after having wasted so much time on a terrible action RPG in search of loot drops so you can kill zombies for the EPIC WINS AND MEMES. Unfortunately for the Dead Island franchise, being the best Dead Island game is like being the best corpse pulled from an alcohol-fueled fiery car wreck/explosion.\n\nEscape Dead Island is not a traditional game in the Dead Island series, so there's no co-op and no loot drops to be had. But somehow, it's even more poorly written and constructed. You're playing as an incredibly whiny and stupid spoiled rich kid with short cropped brown hair and even stupider friends who decide to single-handedly travel to an island full of zombies to find out THE TRUTH BEHIND THE ZOMBIE OUTBREAK IN DEAD ISLAND, which is the single most valuable piece of lore in video games ever. So if you're looking for more poorly written reasons to explain why zombie outbreaks happen, you're gonna get your money's worth here. Oh yeah, and there's also a heap of irritating daddy issues from the protagonist to go with it, all of which don't really get resolved. They're just there to be dispiriting, like most of the flavor text of Dead Island.\n\nSome of your favorite zombie types from Left 4 Dead are here, like The Tank, The Hunter, The Spitter, and even the Siren from Killing Floor makes an appearance! And you're going to meet them all inside of a game that doesn't know whether it wants to be a stealth game, a brawler game, or a survival horror game. Seriously - it tries to be all three, but it's a terrible stealth game because it keeps pushing you towards terrible, unskippable combat scenes, it's a terrible brawler game because fighting zombies basically comes down to mashing quick attack as fast as ♥♥♥♥ing possible, and it's a terrible survival horror game because you're not running out of ammo for your strong melee weapons and any damage you take eventually regenerates if you wait a while and take in the beautiful jungle resort view. (I'm being facetious, of course. Everything looks like it's been wrapped in clingfilm and marked on with a Sharpie.)\n\nThe game is dull as dishwater through most of the six hour run time. I didn't really feel the crazy difficulty spike that made Justin McElroy cry in his Polygon review, but that was because I accidentally stumbled into the Underwater Labs DLC that Fatshark so graciously provided to players as a free update (like a second, smaller fart deployed to distract from the massive atomic blast someone let off at the dinner table), and that hour of ♥♥♥♥ing dullness netted me an assault rifle that ate through all of my shotgun ammo, but took care of the most difficult monsters in seconds. (Also, in one of the final sections, zombies can charge off the crystal platform).\n\nI paid four bucks for this game during a Steam sale, and I still feel like I got ripped off. It's not even a good bad game, like Ride to Hell: Retribution - it's ♥♥♥♥ing dull and dreary and unrelatable, everything I expected from a ♥♥♥♥ing Dead Island game, but somehow managing to be worse than the norm. I don't feel bad at all for the people who saw this and said "Oh boy! Another Dead Island game, except it's single-player and they're promising access to the Beta for Dead Island 2, a game that's stuck in development hell and the developer filing for insolvency! Gonna drop my fifty bucks on a pre-order right nowwww!", because this is an object lesson on why pre-order culture is awful and benefits only the publisher.","January 4","false","6.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

At certain point later in the game, I decided it was unplayably bad for a number of reasons--glitches, lack of any sort of interesting story, zero creative aspects, tedious boss fights, etc. Frustrating and boring the player is a sure way to develop an absolute loser of a game.\n\nLet's be honest. Dead Island and Dead Island: Riptide were glitch-ridden horror shows, but the design and playability outweighed those issues and made for a tremendous amount of fun. Escape Dead Island lacks the playability, the creativity (weapon crafting, anyone?) and just the downright fun of DI  and DI: Riptide. Melee combat is poor, guns are next to useless, and locked-arena boss fights (haven't games evolved beyond this primitive trap?) are needlessly tedious. In short -- this game sports all the glitch of the previous Dead Island games and none -- NONE -- of the fun. I paid $6.79 for this game, but since it's worth less than zero, I figure Deep Silver owes me a few bucks for wasting as much time as I did with it. (Then again, I'm the idiot who kept plodding through this terrible game as long as I did, so I'll let them off the hook.)\n\nWe can only hope that if Dead Island 2 ever launches, it will surpass this POS.","May 7, 2015","false","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathsheeps/recommended/226560/","deathsheeps","DoodleBob SquarePants","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathsheeps/","228 products in account","I feel the need to actually go ahead and post a quick review on this particular game. A quick bit of background about myself. When I originally saw Dead Island, I had absolutely 0 interest in the game. All I saw was the beach scene, over and over again, as my friends attempted to play it. I gave up on watching, but happen to run into the game again when it went free on Xbox. I decided to give it another go, and became quickly addicted. The story, weapon customization, and enemy designs were enough to keep me going. I ended up cranking out the game in 2 days and Riptide soon after that.\n\nAs for Dead Island: Escape....well this is a different story. I will admit that I enjoy the art style of this game, and the combat can certainly be enjoyable at times. However, that is about where my enjoyment for the game ends. What Deep Silver had here, was an opportunity to create a short story in a fun artstyle that expanded on the Dead Island universe, so that we might be held over until Dead Island 2. What we recieved instead, was a game with unlikable characters, repetitive level designs and backtracking, rehased enemies and a dissapointing story. The last 15 minutes of the game had me so frustrated and disengaged that I considered just giving up on finishing the game. However, I pushed through and can safely say that I was extremely dissapointed in the direction that they decided to take with the story, at the end.\n\nIn the end, I managed to get this game and the DLC on sale for $5 on greenmangaming this past week. However, I can't not say that I would not pay that much again for this game. It had such potential to be a short, sweet log into the Dead Island universe....If you are thinking of purchasing the game, save yourself the money and frustration and just look up any backstory from this entry online.\n\nTLDR: Pro/Con List:\n\nPro: +Artstyle is appealing\n+Combat can be rewarding at times\n\nCons: -Dissapointing story\n-Rehashed areas and backtracking\n-Unlikable characters\n-Repetitive enemy design\n-No unique weapon custimization","July 28, 2015","false","8.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They're both just really fun games, despite any flaws. Didn't bother with the Dead Island MOBA.\n\nA lot of my time was spent inspecting almost everything, dying a lot, trying to stealth... It starts a bit slow but it's a pretty interesting game. Don't go into it thinking it will be like DI or DI:Riptide.\n\n**GRAPHICS / LOOKS**\nIt looks like a comic book, kinda a bit like Tell Tale's TWD. I like the looks and you can certainly see why this look was chosen as the story progresses.\n\n**STORY**\nTL;DR + spoiler - I think the story ended up just being a bit convoluted as some things weren't really clear. Maybe because it jumps back and forth in time and is kind of a mindbender as your character deals with having been infected and losing his friends.\n\n---\n\nTakes place 6 months after the events of Dead Island. There is a brief tutorial at the beginning where you play as some agent (who appears to also be a ninja) sent to collect intel of what happened on this island and what this company Geo Pharm has to do with it.\n\nIn the main storyline, you play as Cliff Calo and you're part of a 3-person group going to investigate and write a story about what happened on Banoi. You start off exploring the island, taking photos, and then things start to get weird...your boat mysteriously sinks and you think you can save it but start to drown, then you wake up in a cargo container far from the beach, friends nowhere to be found. It is now you actually run into zombies and have to make your way back to the beach. Once there, cargo containers start falling from the sky and hits you. You then wake up inside a container on the beach. You are bandaged and your friend says they saved you from the sinking boat. From here on out, it will jump back and forth in time, and you deal with different zombie types along the way. But that's only the start of the mindbending story, as your character deals with having been infected and losing his friends.\n\n**GAMEPLAY**\nIt kinda felt like it could end up playing like the original DI, but it only kinda did. Light and Heavy melee attacks, a couple guns, explodable barrels, some of the same special infected...no weapon modding, but you can find upgraded weapons as you progress.\n\nThe gameplay is linear and pretty simple but requires some good timing to quickly avoid attacks and then attack. I like the stealth aspect. It allows you to sneak up and silently kill zombies. Zombies lying on the ground will get up if you attract attention. If stealth isn't an option or you choose to attract attention, be prepared to fight off a couple zombies at a time. This is where the dodging might get tricky. But don't worry, you will regain your health. As for when you die, I think it's pretty cool how they handle that. You DO start back at the last checkpoint, but the transition seems pretty seamless. It's like you fall to the ground and then stand back up and you're back at the checkpoint. No waiting at traditional loading screens.\n\nI played with a controller and the weapon swapping is a gripe, mostly when surrounded, but it could maybe be changed in settings, but I didn't bother to check and just dealt with it.\n\n**VERDICT**\nAll in all, my verdict is it's kinda slow to start but then the story gets very interesting and trippy and the graphics help the story. It's kind of a mindbender because of the jumping back and forward in time and how the world changes to reflect the infection.\n\nWill recommend for those who love Dead Island and those who like mindbending stories.","November 20, 2014","true","10.3"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","25","52","0","0"

There are a ton of collictables to find and the most amazing thing is the story i am bloody hyponatized and want to keep playing just to find out what happens next and it is nice for fans to see some returning members even though it is a prequel .

First the bad: terrible script and voice acting, cringe worthy bad and not being able to remap the right mouse button. Why is this still a problem in games? For ♥♥♥♥ sake let me remap everything right from the get go. That’s it for the negative. I ♥♥♥♥ing loved this game, I loved the graphic style, the combat was satisfying, stealth mechanics worked well for me and it genially had some great horror atmosphere in certain parts. Even the story was interesting, weird and confusing like Silent Hill. Default FOV was fine although pushing it, any narrower and it would have been bad. I loved that your characters clothes and equipment changed visibly throughout the game (reminds me of Freedom Fighters). It even had that Metroid vibe where you go back and revisit areas once you get the right gear and never got repetitive. I really don’t understand all the negative reviews regarding this game it’s like they played 5 minutes and decided it sucked. Stick with it and it really stands out. I love finding games like this that are generally hated but I really enjoy, Trespasser, You are Empty etc.\n\nIf you are a Dead Island fan or a zombie fan try this game out.

This cell-shading and those comic-book sound-words suit it. And I like that it is an original story with loose (at least currently) connections to original game. Adds more depth to the lore of Dead Island, IMHO. In terms of gameplay I am still on the fence at the moment: it started off, practically as a slasher, then turned into stealth. Stealth is not bad and this approach does seem a bit more realistic, that brute head-bashing of the original (although it was fun). The story also has some intriguing points. I only wish there was ana ctual health-bar and ability to jump (jsut for some extra fun), but I can live without them.","November 21, 2014","true","1.4"," 15 of 33 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","15","33","0","0"

Escape Dead Island is a Survival-Mystery game set on the enigmatic island of Narapela after the events of the zombie outbreak of the original Dead Island. The story lets players unravel the origins of the zombie virus through the eyes of the would-be documentary journalist Cliff Calo. There are no superpowers to keep Cliff alive, just a few makeshift weapons against hordes of infected zombies.

But its great.\nArt is really strange but interesting, adds some freshness into the game.\nControls are also pretty decent, I am using controller for playing and I am happy. Cant give any proper words about keyboard+mouse controls, but I recommend controller.\nThere is a prologue mission that cannot be skipped where you play as an unknown character and search through an unknown place. I must say its a really good start of a story, even I wasn't expecting.\nRest of the game is set on the island of Narapela in Banoi archipelago. You play as Cliff Calo, the you son of a, I think its a reporter or someone similar. He and his friends want to uncover the mystery behind the mysterious events on islands...\n\n*SPOILER AHEAD*\nCliff stole his fathers boat to be able to sail to the islands. Cliff's friends thought they are going to visit Banoi, but when they reached the island Cliff says they are not going to Banoi.  It was Narapela. The island seemed pretty peaceful, but they soon found a problem, if weren't zombies, but earthquake hit them and sunk their boat. Cliff was trying to save their stuff, but he was hit by an explosion and drowned. That's where the fun begins.

And is not fitting into the Dead Island series.\n- Strange story mode, strange hallucinations trhough the whole game. This makes the game completely diffrent from the Dead Island series.\n- Strange and sometimes quite difficult ingame action controlls.\n- Automatic save point, which are followed up with "ingame movies" which can not be skipped. So when you die, you start again at this automatic save point, and you have to watch these ingame (sometimes quite boring) movies over and over until you get to the next save point. This makes the game verry annoying.","November 10, 2015","false","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Turns tedious along the way though\n- Voice acting is okay for the most part\n\nThe average\n- The controls take some time getting used to, at least using a control pad\n- The cel shading graphics fit the setting, nothing special here though\n\nThe bad\n- 99% linear gameplay\n- AI is awful; the challenge is based on confined level design w/o room to maneuver\n- Especially towards the end ecounters get very frustating. I guess they had to stretch the game in order to resemble the   struggle you're going through\n- The ending leaves to be desired: no closure. Perhaps they want to catch up on that in EDI 2...\n\nIf you're bored through a free weekend it's worth a shot at 80% discount - don't bother otherwise.\n\n3/10","September 21, 2015","false","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good enough to keep me occupied and the controls arent TERRIBLE but there are certainly moments that make no bloody sense. It seems like the collision control when you are crouching is glitched because I have been crouched with NOTHING around me and it said I couldnt stand up because there was something in the way.\n\nOh wait, a soda can...that must be the reason I cant stand up while being attacked by enemies who CAN stand up xD\n\nRandom litter is always an excuse for things not to work.\n\nBut hey it kept me curious on what comes next and I kept playing despite that its an irritating bug.","May 8","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But watch out if you want a typical FPS. There is no jump move, so you are tied to the ground like a rail shooter unless the game needs you to jump or do something.
