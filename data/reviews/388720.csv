Well the difficulty scalling is really well made and the mechanics are really good which provides you a fair challenge BUT the more progress you make the less room you have to breath and think of your next move (especially the last level) which is really good and give a right sense of accomplishement ( I have yet to try the No Urgent Ascend challenge QQ).\n\nI really enjoyed playing the game so far, as you may have read on some other reviews the controls sometimes aren't responding or have some kind of input lag (i was using a 360 controller so i don't know about the keyboard users) but that doesn't stop you from having a good experience.\n\nThe graphics are really cool even if some level looks kinda poor in details compared to other and the animation of the character is kinda meh when you just run around but it's not really an issue.\n\nI kinda missed playing good 3d platformers which become way too rare these days and would love to have more levels or maybe a map editor to have fun with :)\n\nThis game really deserve more attention for i like to see more of these in the future, hats down to the devs because the gameplay got me hooked up as well as the soundtrack which is by the way really cool !\n\n10/10 would like to get more levels :D","November 22, 2015","true","3.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nyazgriz/recommended/388720/","nyazgriz","Razgriz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nyazgriz/","709 products in account","This game is flawed as hell but damn if I didn't have fun with it. It's a platformer with an emphasis on speed running and mild puzzle solving where you play as a girl trying to escape a virtual world called the Nexus. You can double jump, air dash, and ground pound. You can also bounce of the heads of enemies or kick them around with an air kick. You also have an emergency jump that's on a timer that allows you to jump really high every 30 seconds. You basically just race to the finish while doing all these things in order to progress.\n\nThe big flaw of the game is that sometimes the controls just feel like they don't respond. You go to bounce of the head of an enemy that is your ticket to the next platform and then suddenly you fall past it to your death. This maybe happened 1 in every 30ish enemies but it was really annoying. However, I feel as though the developer may have understood this was an issue which is why I believe the emergency jump was put in. It saves you from mistakes and keeps you going when you should have failed. The only other real issue was the final level's "boss." The boss uses different attacks at different stages but sometimes you advance into the next stage when an attack from the last stage is happening. It results in a mechanic that was easy to avoid in the last stage killing you in the next since it is not really fair for that stage.\n\nThis all seems bad but the game does so many things right. Movement is fluid and the music is amazing. The graphics are not great but there are still a few moments that look really good. I would recommend it on a sale since the game is short but for 5 dollars I would say it's worth it.","August 31, 2015","true","5.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRyDesigns/recommended/388720/","TheRyDesigns","TheRyDesigns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRyDesigns/","750 products in account","Link: The Unleashed Nexus is a fast-paced action puzzle platformer made by Reminisce. You start off as an anime girl who seems trapped in some sort of void or chamber filled with ethereal beings which you can pass through. Afterwards, you jump into the actual puzzle platformer aspect of the game. There’s a very helpful tutorial that teaches you the basics of dashing, moving, flying, etc that should appeal to newcomers to this genre and game overall. Soon after the tutorial is finished, you get placed into the game where you have the freedom to dash, fly and move around the area to reach the goal piece which is a glowing statue of sorts that you have to hit in order to proceed to the next room or level. I’m going to list some pro’s and con’s this game has to offer and finish off my final thoughts on this game.\n\nPro’s+Intuitive Gameplay let’s you make your own choices and act accordingly\n+Japanese and English layout and subtitles\n+Challenging to the point where I got stuck on room 2\n+Fast Paced\n+60 FPS\n+High resolution settings\n+No cutscenes or dialogue saves the developers a lot of money\n+Full Controller Support (I personally use the Xbox One Controller)\n+Only $10\n\nCon’s-Single Player makes it so there’s no interactivity with other players (not even leaderboards)\n-Little sense of direction\n-Decent Graphics (if you’re looking for Unreal Engine graphics, look elsewhere, they’re decent enough)\n-Very few graphic settings. (Only “resolution”)\n-Not an original concept (lot’s of other devs have made games like this; i.e Cloudbuilt)\n-Hit detection for certain models slightly buggy\n-ONLY Japanese and English layout and subtitles\n-Puzzle layout’s feel familiar (copypasta)\n-No cutscenes or dialogue makes the gameplay slightly stale\n\n\nHonestly, this game is pretty decent for this dev studio’s first indie release and for being only $10. If you don’t mind the slightly repetitive levels, little sense of direction, no cutscenes or dialogue, the game offers a cool experience if you’re looking for something you can play for a little bit at a time and if you’re a fan of the genre, you should get it. I recommend it for the price tag and the fact that it’s a generally decent game for this studio’s first release.\n\nBy the way, you can also find this review on my review site here[www.tacotaku.com]","August 21, 2015","true","0.4"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","16","23","2","0"

Story being displayed in small white text in the middle of your screen in a timed game is a little annoying and the menu likes to exit full screen. If you can get past the UI issues, it is a wonderful and beautiful game.","August 23, 2015","true","0.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtechnetia/recommended/388720/","xtechnetia","» ∞ TDM xtechnetia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xtechnetia/","71 products in account","There's a lot that could be held against Link: The Unleashed Nexus. The menus are oddly difficult to navigate, the controls are sometimes janky (which makes a huge difference in a 3D platformer like this), the story is alright at best, the cartoonish art style of the protagonist looks weird against the more realistic backgrounds...in short, it's not the most polished experience you'll see.\n\nBut all of that can be forgiven by how awesome the whole thing feels. Ever wanted to be a girl who can jump, air dash, and platform with the best of them? You do now. A short experience, but a fun one and recommended as long as you're ready to tolerate some platforming frustration.\n\nOh, and: awesome soundtrack.","April 30","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Somewhat of a short game, yet still enjoyable. Does have a few performance issues with jittering, and a lack of graphical settings.\n\nI'd rate it 8/10\n\nPick it up during a sale, then sell the trading cards to recoup 1.50 of what you spent.","May 1","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
