This game is genius.\n\nStoryline: Basic breakdown is that you are trapped within some funky arcade machine that has gone vicious thanks to the devil himself deciding to be a programmer. Take the cover of the game.. Take what you expect the game to be and throw them out the window. Already as you begin, it's clear that something isn't right - Having to fix a broken and glicthy menu from the get go before you're able to commence the gameplay is a sign that the devil may not be as good of a programmer as he likes to think.\n\nAs the cursed player of this hellish demon-game, you get whisked around from a chaotic, glitchy, broken world to a cutesey, diabetes-inducing pastel nightmare, with random logic puzzles thrown in, to fix Satan's buggy code. As you guide your pony through the devil's glitchy game, you can catch brief glimpses of who your character used to be before they were killed and trapped in the game. The story is gritty, blurred and as twisty as the day is long. Basically, it's fantastic.\n\nGameplay: I feels as though I had to make an extra section *just* for gameplay because it's honestly that damn good. The ingenuity of the puzzles, the level designs and the text communication alone make it note worthy. Pony Island as a whole is magnificent and shows incredibly unique ideas put together insanely well. When something like this, running on such simple mechanics can set an atmosphere so well, it raises the bar for many other games to do the same.\n\nAlso! Passcodes to keep tucked away until needed; Baphomet and 2023\n\nGraphics: The look of it makes it feel like a genuine ported arcade game. It's pixely, it's box-like, it's all kinds of good while been fairly simplistic.\n\nMenus: Broken because of Satan.\n\nSoundtrack: This goes from being an eerie and abrasive glitchy, retro, electronic style base for the tension and horror-ish atmosphere and then completely flips a coin to be colorful, cute and innocent with its uncomfortably cheerful electronic notes. The changes in this set the scene and is yet another thing that makes this game so unique, it's unlike anything you've heard before.\n\nFinal Conclusion: Get this. Seriously. It's rare that games can really spice things up with something new. With that been said, unique ideas are one thing, but it's the fact that they are brought together well that makes Pony Island stand above the rest. It keeps you thinking, provides great atmosphere, keeps you on your toes and has so much hidden content perfect for those willing to look for it.","January 7","true","10.2"," 40 of 48 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","40","48","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/recommended/405640/","AestheticGamer","AestheticGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AestheticGamer/","3606 products in account","Pony Island is a game best experienced knowing as little as possible, just know the game is about a couple hours long to beat normally, there's hidden collectibles that unlock the true ending, the base gameplay is a Runner-type of game with a few twists, and it plays with the idea of game development.\n\nNow slight spoilers ahead, but I'll try to avoid any major spoilers, just things you could figure out from the first 30 minutes of play.\n\nThe idea of a 'corrupted' video game is not an original idea at this point, but this may be the best it's been executed thus far. Pony Island has you playing a corrupted Runner-type game starring a Pony, and the game at various points wants you to stop to "Insert Your Soul," to continue in some way. The game is extremely meta in a number of ways, and is more about breaking the game than completing said tasks... Though breaking the game comes in a multitude of types, some feeling more natural, others more from a series of mechanics. Outside of the Runner Gameplay, the game mixes itself up quite often, with the most common mix-up being these puzzle type of scenarios that are supposed to represent programming where a key goes down a list with variable-changing stats, you need to get to a certain stat to unlock Red 'block' gates, and you do this by inserting commands into blank slots to perform some sort of function. It sounds complicated on paper, but the game paces these extremely well so that they're simple to understand at first and slowly build on themselves.\n\nThere's a story here that develops, and one difference in this game compared to many other 'corruption' type games is its narrative angle. We seem to be playing some guy playing a cursed arcade machine, his 3D hands sometimes pop-up on the screen and sometimes we break off of the arcade screen to see glimpses of the world off the screen. There's another soul trapped in the game trying to help us out to make sure we don't meet the same fate, and we get a direct line of communication with the maker of the game who is updating the game based off of our 'playtesting,' and gets mad when we 'cheat' at his game and, 'don't play how it was intended.' The game is never scary, just sometimes a bit creepy and also has a good sense of humor, as well as some semi-commentary on aspects of game design, including author's intent and gratification they look for when making games, which I haven't seen explored really in any other game I've played.\n\nIt's a fun ride, sometimes challenging, tricky to get the true ending without a guide, but an experience worth taking I would say. The gameplay is fun most of the time in all of its different forms, there's many twists and turns along the way, the narrative is nice backdrop to everything else, and the game successfully may catch you off-guard multiple times during its course. Probably the best realized attempt at a corrupted game to this point in time, and even outside of that, a fairly fun multi-layered experience in its own right.","January 13","true","4.5"," 36 of 42 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","36","42","2","0"

Neat story, interesting puzzles and elements. Great music. Got $5? Worth.\n\nYou start up the game and immediately are confused by the title screen. So you took action and begin playing the game. You play as a happy little pony, where you are galloping across the field and jump past the fences, in hopes to beat the game, only to find out that something is wrong with this game called 'Pony Island'.\n\nIt's hard to give a good review of this game without spoiling what it really is about. That being said, I would advise to go in blind (no playthroughs/walkthroughs), as you will find to be more satisfied of the game but I'll try my best to make it short and sweet while not including spoilers in here.\n\nThe game isn't really scary (except maybe for some that were really looking for a 'pony adventure' game) but the 'psychological horror genre fits, as it does makes you think. The game isn't very long, I would say that the average one would need to complete the game would be around 2 hours. However, it makes up for it by introducing neat new elements as you progress, like 4th wall breaking interactions, new puzzle elements, and more interesting secrets to discover.\n\nAll in all, I think this is one of those indie games that stands out and for the right reasons. Good story, interesting gameplay, good music (at least I personally think so), and cool game elements. The game doesn't cost very much, so I would say that it's very much worth for the price.","January 26","true","6.4"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","33","39","2","0"

It will be in the guise... of a pony.\n\nAfter repeatedly having to fix the arcade machine that houses PONY ISLAND's game-within-a-game by re-routing code and battling mysteriously uncooperative menus, you will be faced with a monochrome fence jumping simulator designed by the Devil himself to keep you in a Matrix-style state of placidity while he attempts to harvest your soul.\n\nIf that opening spiel seems simultaneously baffling, disturbing and blackly humorous then I have succeeded in communicating the beautiful madness of Pony Island's struggle to escape an almost perfect trap; as soon as you start to succeed at the game, your unholy adversary changes the rules by bombarding you with unkillable demons, reinventing his tedious jumping simulator as a full-fledged adventure game or unleashing his vicious lieutenants upon you, at least one of which is genuinely unnerving.\n\nWhile it has a tendency to overplay a few of its puzzles, the astonishing imagination, wit and variety you'll encounter in Pony Island make it nothing short of an essential part of 2016's library.\n\nFull review below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3_rHhADWBc","January 4","true","2.4"," 36 of 48 people (75%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","75","36","48","17","0"

The start button doesn't work, so you go to the options menu and tick "Fix Main Menu". Now your game launches properly.\nThe best part about the game is the creepy atmosphere throughout, and how you attempt to figure out what the backstory is, and how to progress. Without giving away much, I will just say what the game advertises on the store page. The game you are playing is possessed by Satan, and therefore messes with you.\n\nFinding secrets is intuitive and fun. You feel smart when you complete puzzles and progress.\n\nThe story is actually pretty interesting, and well told, however I don't want to get into it in this review as it's something best experienced first-hand.\n\nThe music is great, and really helps set the mood. There are so many small details that just add to the general creepy atmopshere.\n\nThe gameplay mostly consists of a few specific gameplay types:\n\nYou've got sections where you jump and shoot as a pony, avoiding obstacles. It's very simple, but actually has new mechanics added throughout to make it fun and rewarding.\nThe second is a type of programming minigame, where you need to guide objects around using different types of symbols. A refreshing change of pace compared to the other stuff, and again quite fun.\nLastly, you navigate a computer-like interface, figuring out secrets.\n\nI've completed the game, yet there's still incentive to replay it to 100% all the fun collectibles. So it has a bit of replay value.\n\nOverall, I really think if the game even slightly piques your interest, you should definitely try it out.

Here's why:\n\nPony Island, is well, not exactly a "pony game" But I wont spoil anything story related.\nJust like the game description says, You are a trapped soul in Lucifer's hellhole of an arcade\nwhere you have to survive buy playing his game. Its a pretty intermediate puzzle game, making it\na more casual play style if you are familiar with it. Excellent for new players as well.\n\nHowever the game only contain's 3 game mechanics;\n\n*a side scrolling platformer in which you have to avoid obstacles and fight enemies*\n*redirection puzzles which most puzzle-gamers might not find enjoyable about a 2 playthrough because the solution is the same*\n*A click and scroll computer and graphical interface while may seem to be challenging only because you are rarely shown and told where you need to go, it often takes alot of random luck and fumble to go where you need to advance\n\nThe story is great, original and replayable to a point where its not repetitve . I defintely tip my hat to the developers for this wonderful concept\nof a horror-esque arcade wonderland.\n\nIn short\n\nDemonic Art style is 8/10\nStory 10/10, koodoes\nGameplay 9/10\n\n10/10 would definetly be a soul trapped in a pony and trying to escape Satan's arcade all over again\n\nIts 5 bucks, just buy it and enjoy","January 6","true","2.7"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","19","25","3","0"

Yeah, alot of it has been done before, but Pony Island is still quite fun to play and has a good deal of gameplay considering the modest price tag.\n\nWhat you should know: the gameplay is reminiscent of the flood of recent indie-programmer-sims or logic puzzlers. You have to use really basic logic structure to guide a key into the keyhole. Thats as basic as I can explain it. Yeah that mechanic gets tedious, but thankfully theres lots of other mini-game-like elements to break it up.\n\nIf you really don't want to drop the five bucks, just watch a LetsPlay and I'm sure you are getting 90% of the experience.","January 9","true","0.9"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","65","22","34","9","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceAdmiralLaika/recommended/405640/","SpaceAdmiralLaika","Space Admiral Laika","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SpaceAdmiralLaika/","242 products in account","Pony Island is reminiscent of some old experimental Flash games, adhering to the genre which mischievously bullies the player and encourages exploration in a sort-of-point-and-click interface, albeit more refined and containing elements which would be technically impossible in a Flash container.\n\nThe story is cute, amusing and not overly serious, although the game did have some welcome, unexpected points of intrigue. The writing could be better, one may feel that the concept of the game could have been realized much more convincingly had the writing been wittier, but I found it to be adequate.\n\nThe game is fairly short, but fitting for the type of experience it offers: it is not so short that it feels underwhelming, and not so long that it outstays its welcome. Secrets are plentiful for those with a keen eye and creative mind. Additional playthroughs to uncover more secrets rewards those with a completionist mindset, although the replayability of the game is lacking, with little to no variation.\n\nThe soundtrack is catchy and appropriate, bearing (largely) a sense of doom and desperation, with flares of ferocity and determination; erratic and enjoyable.\n\nIf the premise of the game and its promotional material appeals to you, then I think that you will likely find Pony Island to be a fun, novel experience.\n\nEasily my favorite pony-themed non-pony game.","February 4","true","6.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/recommended/405640/","emperorgandhi","[CotC] King Conga Gandhi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emperorgandhi/","194 products in account","Pony Island has interested me ever since I first learned of its existence when it first came out. It looked interesting enough, so I figured I would probably pick it up and give it a go whenever I had some spare money on me. That day came, and after going through this game in my freetime, I'm pretty content with the end result. Pony Island is one of the most original games in years, and my brain needs some repairs after I got through with the game.\n\nGraphics\nThere isn't really much to say about the graphics. It's all sorts of things. On one hand, it's a happy pony game that a brony could probably enjoy, while on the other hand, the game is black and white with some other colors to make the game feel a lot more demonic, which pretty much sums up this entire game. There are hints of "realism" here and there, but for the most part it's a Unity game with a unique twist to it.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay doesn't have much to it either. The overall idea of it is simple enough. Shoot lasers at bad guys and jump. They didn't screw up with that (although it was difficult to mess that up anyway) and the puzzles are pretty solid. They're usually pretty simple but occasionally you'll run into one that makes you think long and hard. However, I do have my complaints here. Although the gameplay is simple and more reliant on the story, there are some parts to the game that feel really tedious. I will not get specific for the sake of spoilers. Also, again with the spoilers thing, the final boss did feel a little disappointing. It was very easy, and I was expecting a challenge considering who it was.\n\nStory\nHere's where Pony Island is truly special. I don't think I've ever seen a game get more crazy with breaking the fourth wall as much as this one. Actually, this game showed me the most creative and clever fourth wall break I've ever seen in anything: movies, shows, video games, everything! I won't spoil it, but it's towards the end of the game, and I was genuinely shocked and tricked, something I don't say very often considering that I'm a ruthless and manipulative dictator. The rest of the overall story was very interesting. I was on the edge of my seat every minute, and I was waiting for some other trick to come my way and screw me over. This was the entire game, well, until the end. Although I was excited to finish the game and see what the finale would be, I felt it was very underwhelming to be honest. The ending wasn't THAT bad, because I don't mind endings where it's open to interpretation but I felt the game was missing something. With the final battle and that overall part of the game, I was bored and just wanted it to get overwith, simply for the reason you couldn't lose. I wish the fight had some more buildup, and the fight itself was actually exciting. However, it felt more like a chore and the story ended on a rather blegh note. However, the rest of the game was really interesting, and the finale was nowhere near as disappointing as something like Firewatch.\n\nAudio\nNot much to say here, but I am actually pleasantly surprised with the music. It felt very fitting, and made the game a lot more intense and enjoyable. Not to levels of something like Undertale or Mega Man, but it was still very good for a game like this and fit the mood perfectly.\n\nReplayability\nI cannot get into detail about the replayability without spoiling part of the game, so check the score at the bottom for my opinion.\n\nVerdict\nIn the end, Pony Island destroyed part of my brain, and I'm going to have to fix it whenever I get an oportiunty, uh, I mean, opportunity. It feels fresh and creative, something rare to say about games today. I don't see this game as something revolutionary that will be remembered as a huge cult classic, but for what's it worth, it should be remembered for how clever this game was when it comes to toying with your mimed, oops, I meant mind.\n\nGraphics - 7.5/10\nGameplay - 7.5/10\nStory - 9.0/10\nAudio - 8.5/10\nReplayability - 6.5/10\n\n.:8.2/10:.\n\n+Creative presentation\n+Mind-blowing plot\n+Fun puzzles\n+Surprisingly good music\n+Extremely clever 4th wall breaks\n\n-Underwhelming final boss and ending\n-Occasional tedious segments","March 21","true","3.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

(and spoilers can ruin this one a lot more than the other recent sleeper hit Undertale) This isn't going to be a very meaty review.\n\nIt's not so much a traditional horror game as it's really just more of a mindscrew, an evolution of many of the themes from the .EXE craze but with many, many innovations of its own. Also, a lot of in-jokes if you've at least even experimented with programming...not needed to beat the game of course.\n\nIt's worth the $5 asking price. It seems to be a 2-5 hour experience depending on how much ticket hunting you do, though there seems to be a bit of meta/AR going on in the community and the developer is very active in supporting this title.

Let's do it!"\n~The Two Drunkards who came up with the initial concept of Pony Island.\n\nLets start with this, if you plan on buying this game at all, DO NOT SPOIL IT FOR YOURSELF. Most of the fun from this game comes from the "What's next?"\n\nAnyways with that said I rate this about a 7/10 overall.\nPrice - 10/10 - you can't get better than 5 bucks.\nGameplay - 8/10 - the game play overall is fun and enjoyable, with a few simple mechanics that kept me intrested and puzzles that were fun and somewhat challenging near the end.\nStory - 7/10 - The game overall has a story to it yes, and it's engaging and keeps you intrested. To be honest I liked it a lot, but it's not going to compete with games like "Life is Strange" and "Clannad" and so on. The story at its base was crap, however incorperated into this game it was funny and very entertaining.\nReplayability - 4/10 - This is where the game falls off significantly. You play through it once and you've seen it all, okay maybe twice, but you're not going to have the same experiance or challenges. It's a one time game, which for 5 bucks is perfect.\n\nAnyways I wont be writing any oppions about Pony Island story so as not to spoil the game. I would recomend pick the game up for sure, it's a very well done game and worth the play through.\n\n","February 13","true","3.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoarsehorse/recommended/405640/","hoarsehorse","SCP-1471","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hoarsehorse/","68 products in account","Pony Island: Ponies. Yeah ponies. Comedy ensues?\nJust know of you read any further into this review, you might end up spoiling the game for yourself. This one thing hate about alot of clever indie games that are trying to follow in the steps of games like Undertale. So just know, I might end up mentioning certain things that will spoil parts of the game. So, here we go!\n\nAlso, it's best you go in blind.\n\nI supported Pony Island when it started off on Steam Greenlight. When checking out the free Game Jam version and playing it all the way through, I saw potential in this game and made sure Steam knew that I wanted that game and I guess many others did too.\n\nPony Island, like Undertale, meta-games a decent bit but more towards the end than anything else. It is also kind of clever in it's execution of how game tells a different story then what you shown. From what some people have speculated, it shows how some game developers go through hell developing a game. I kind of support this idea but meh this is a review not an episode of Game Theory starring MatPat\n\nThe gameplay of this game is sub-par. The Platforming is solid and fun and the hacking minigames aren't too bad durning the first act. Then the second act comes in and then these parts of the game become repetive. They are really nice break though and give the player some interaction side from navigating a desktop or moving a pony across the world map. The first two boss fights aren't that great.\n\n[SPOLIERS STARTING]\n\nThe first is just four hacking minigames where it's like Connect Four in a way as you and the demon take turns placcing certain code blocks. The final hack of this fight however, brings in the challenge and makes you plan your moves a bit better. The second boss fight is the platforming sections where you are chasing a demon as it throws down giant rock spikes and creating fissures for you to jump over while you shoot the glowly bits on the demon's face. The third fight however... lets just say it was clever. Really. Damn. Clever. This is where the meta-gaming truly comes as the demon uses your computer to mess with you durning the battle requires you to stay focused. The final fight is just another platforming section where you try to keep as many souls alive as possible while trying to survive the game having it's memory dumped.\n\nThe games plot is kind of cryptic, requiring you to really look at things from different angles to understand what is going and having you find the secert demons that lie with in the game. Also, to get the final ending, it requires you to collect 24 tickets that are hidden throughout the game. Some aren't that hard but others are like hidden to point that you need the guy who made the game tell "There is a ticket if you do X task and go to Y location."\n\nThe music in this game, as with alot of great indie games, are freaking amazing. The small 8-bits tunes you here as you play the game are very good and they match each situation well and can work well outside if their intended area if you want to play a different game with Pony Island's music.\n\nI like Pony Island and it's great if you are looking for a game to kill some time with.

The entire premise itself is cool. I just really loved this game.

It’s a game about playing a game that isn’t really a game; it’s a sentient arcade cabinet – that just happens to contain a game featuring the odd pony – that wants to drive you mad and swallow your soul. But sometimes it’s more; there are hints of grander schemes shifting in the shadows, hidden beneath the code. Pony Island is a game about ponies.

Even if you do have your guard up and expect the game to fool you, it'll probably manage to at least once anyways. It plays out as both a runner game and a puzzle game, and uses both in interesting ways. I can't say much more and frankly I feel like I've said too much already, but Pony Island is an extremely interesting game and totally worth $5.","January 12","true","4.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

It's meta nature keeps things fresh and is likely to keep suprising you during your experience - a game that manages that is worth the pricetag attached to Pony Island in my book.\n\nAdmittedly it's not very long to finish - in my case, first playthrough took about 3h; after that it's going back to hunt for all missed secrets (where I found about half of the 24 total after my first run). There's also some replay value as little things change if you play the game a second time or approach matters a bit differently when there's a chance.\n\nLast but not least, it has a nice soundtrack that fits the glitchy theme of the game and helps create and maintain the atmosphere it aims for.","January 30","true","12.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Plenty of twists and turns in a fun, compact, game that's easy on the wallet.\n\nAbsolutely recommended, play it before watching any LP's or extensive reviews.\n\nPros:\n+ Really cool concept and great execution.\n+ Genuinely creepy moments, a very fresh take on horror.\n+ Puzzles get progressively more challenging, and feel great when you complete the trickier ones.\n+ Only $5.\n\nDebatables:\n+/- Short, at about 2 hours long.\n+/- Ponies may be offputting to some, but as the trailer says, it's not really about the pony.\n+/- Offensive to religious people? Maybe? I dunno.\n\nCons:\n- You'll probably only play through it once or twice.\n- Some sound effects are a little irritating.\n\n----------------------------\n\nCheck my video review too:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/7DYJbL0OCwY\n\nNote: The custom thumbnail isn't displaying correctly.

I bet they'll even call you a "brony" and you'll get to feel REALLY COOL as you correct them.

There are a few bugs to be worked out I suppose (I'm currently waiting for the developer to patch a fix in for an issue I pointed out), but the fact that I care enough to wait is basically proof that it must be doing something right.\n\nI'm hesitant to say more because, like Undertale and The Magic Circle and Stanley Parable before it, most of the enjoyment here comes from being surprised, so yeah.

It dances around Meta-fourth-wall-breaking gaming territory that is covered by Undertale.  The overall tone is quite similar to Undertale too only the darkness is a lot more in your face.  The game is mainly about puzzle solving and thinking otuside the box when it comes to games.  The plot is very engaging, posing a lot of questions about who you are, where you are and how you got there and your only thing to go on is this possessed arcade machine.  Yes.  That's what the game is about.\n\nI got about 2 hours out of the game to finish the main plot once, I'm tempted to revisit to unlock more achievements; I haven't discovered everything the game has to offer it turns out.

When I played it, I was amazed that this game isn't more popular.  What a remarkble little game for $5, and while the name of the game and screenshots might confuse you, this game is deceptive on a variety of levels.\n\nThe premise involves you being trapped in an old video game trying to escape.  This involves solving very creative and often funny puzzles made by the creator to figure out how to bring down the system.  A narrative told through the visual style of an old run down operating system has a lot of memorable moments.\n\nIt's not a super long game but I think it's worth the asking price, if only to show support for what I think is a remarkable idea for a game that is executed masterfully.\n\n","February 23","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhoenixSpectre/recommended/405640/","PhoenixSpectre","MuffinWizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PhoenixSpectre/","175 products in account","It is incredibly hard for me to say what I liked about this game. Perhaps it's because I like My Little Pony and even a small mention of ponies brought joy to me. But that is only a small part of what drew me and why I liked it.\n\nThough I don't think it will help to say it (in a reviewing context anyways) I loved everything about this game. That off the table, I'll try to give a productive review:\n\nI've always been a fan of puzzle games, and this has to be one of the more interesting ones I've found. The puzzles start out easy and steadily get more complex as the game progresses. I wouldn't say they get terribly hard, but I did end up spending 10-20 minutes on one of the later puzzles in the game.\n\nBeyond that, though there isn't much to go on in the story at first, as I learned more and found out more things, I became intrigued. So much so that after a certain point in the story, I actually felt myself becoming extremely invested. I wanted to finish it and to help... well... I'll leave out the rest of that due to spoilers. But I can say that I was gripped. Beyond that, when I finally unlocked the games secret ending, I had to pat the developer on the back for multiple things. Firstly, to make me feel bad/sad in so few words from a character, or to throw me into a situation where I was no longer sure I wanted to complete the game, but simply live out the peaceful catharsis I had been given by the original ending. For the style it was presented in, I was feeling things. And I was feeling them rather strongly.\n\nThe wealth of easter eggs and secrets also made me happy. They are hard to find, but if you derp around for long enough, you should find them all. The only advice that I can give is to look everywhere and to try clicking on everything. And I do mean EVERYTHING. I can't recommend a guide as the feeling you get when finding everything yourself is rather awesome, since the developer hid a good deal of things in some rather obscure or neat ways.\n\nThe way that the story and puzzles are presented, the way that the game will occasionally reach out from the fourth wall and give you a pat on the head and a cookie for being a clever little gamer, it all somehow works together to make an experience so entertaining... so unique and undefineable, that even all the words I'm typing here can't quite do it justice. And perhaps that is why I have such trouble describing what exactly I like. Because what I like isn't so much aspects of the game, but a few moments that it presents to me. A few quotes the characters say. It isn't so much the composition, but what I am given by what has been composed.\n\nWalls of text aside, let me make my point clear: I preordered Fallout 4. I played it on launch day and have since sunk over 100, maybe even 200 hours into that game. I love it that much. I also plan to play Dark Souls 3 once I can afford it. But I would recommend Pony Island above and beyond those games, though for two main reasons:\n\nFirstly, it costs a LOT less. Just $5 (from when I'm writing this, anyway). About the price of a beer at an upscale bar. It can be bought as an afterthought and will provide you with an amazing experience and a little bit of replayability to find all the secrets you missed. And secondly, in my humble opinion, this game presents a story coupled with a unique an memorable experience that you won't be able to match. Fallout 4, though a great game, is another Fallout game. As Dark Souls 3 will be another Souls game. But this stands on its own.\n\nIt stands on its four majestic hooves, galloping through the fields of your memory, leaping and soaring over gates whilst burning its place into your mind with its laser blasts.\n\nWhile I realize I may have over-hyped it, I truly love it that much. If this makes just a few more people play it, it's worth it. It really is.","April 1","true","6.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was just waiting so looong to get a game like that. ( Not because of satan tho ). Cause' of pixels, quite dark atmosphere of the game which i like.\n\nThe price of game - that game is very cheap in my opinion. I got it for free anyway (  thanks to my friend ).\n\n\nThe gameplay could be little longer doe.\n\nI prefer that game to everyone who likes dark atmosphere, hacking into devil's "core", pixels and a lot of things that are in that game.\n\n9/10.\n\nP.S Sorry for my bad English though.","February 6","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It dances around Meta-fourth-wall-breaking gaming territory that is covered by Undertale.  The overall tone is quite similar to Undertale too only the darkness is a lot more in your face.  The game is mainly about puzzle solving and thinking otuside the box when it comes to games.  The plot is very engaging, posing a lot of questions about who you are, where you are and how you got there and your only thing to go on is this possessed arcade machine.  Yes.  That's what the game is about.\n\nI got about 2 hours out of the game to finish the main plot once, I'm tempted to revisit to unlock more achievements; I haven't discovered everything the game has to offer it turns out.  So this game has more depth than it may first appear.  4 pounds for 2 hours may not seem appealing but those 2 hours will ♥♥♥♥.  YOU.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dumpfmoebel/recommended/405640/","dumpfmoebel","eigenwillige frucht-pizza","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dumpfmoebel/","72 products in account","I heard about Pony Island while looking for innovative horror games, and my expectations were equally met and disappointed. Disappointed regarding the "horror" aspect, as it was not really a game that scared me - and trust me, I'm a HUGE weenie - but met regarding a good and enjoyable game experience. Pony Island is cheeky, amusing and thoroughly fun; I often found myself grinning at some events during the game, thinking about how much the developer must have giggled while implementing those ideas.\n\nStill, I have to say that while the game is certainly entertaining (and has a super catchy soundtrack) and innovative in some aspects, I found some design choices to be rather foreseeable and cliché, maybe because I've read too many creepypasta already. I think it works if you see this game as more of a comedy thing that pokes fun at those tropes, but if you are expecting to be seriously creeped out, it might make you groan at some points. I also found that it could've been a bit more unconventional and daring in its actions... this way, it was fun, but there are some points where I thought the whole shtick could've been taken a little further.\n\nAlso, I highly advise you to play the game in the language your operating system is set to, or some errors will occur that will definitely have a negative impact on the game's enjoyability. I can't delve into it further, but it's a thing.\n\nEither way, all in all I recommend Pony Island if...\n... you enjoy games with a distinct Indie flavor that toy with conventional game mechanics\n... you think you'd have fun going through an easy-on-the-skills mix of logic puzzles and jump'n'run\n... you want to jam to some 8-bit-y tunes accompanied by the nostalgic whirring of an old computer's fans\n... being pranked and fooled makes you laugh along\n... you love adorable ponies!!!!!\n\nOn the other hand, don't spend your money on this if...\n... you're looking for a good scare that leaves you sleepless\n... you want gameplay that challenges your skills\n... you expect a deep, thoughtful and elaborate storyline that stays with you for days after completing\n... you hate being the butt of a joke\n... imagery and topics related to the devil, demons etc. have a serious negative impact on your health (I'm serious, I know some people who have a problem with stuff like that)","May 28","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After the massive underground success of the 4th wall breaking darling that is Undertale, I was prepared for the onslaught of indie titles that pushed the button of being self aware. But what tickles me about Pony Island in particular is that it’s clear that its developer, Daniel Mullens, wasn’t making an attempt to ride any meta coattails. Pony Island was released in January of this year—just a fistful of months after Undertale arrived to the delight of gamers and DeviantArt account holders alike—far from enough time to take the derivative route.\n\nWhich means that as an artform, video games are taking a turn around the bend, here. We’ve gotten past what graphics and clever plot twists can teach us, and developers are responding to that by questioning the position of the player within the game’s universe. Which is sort of amazing. Of course there were isolated incidents: Psycho Mantis reading your memory card is fondly remembered for a reason. But we’ve reached the point where the meta role of a player within the game is being examined far more closely. And that’s exciting as hell.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoERkB0MDTs","June 5","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a hard game to review  because giving any details about it would end up in me spoiling it. If I had to give this game a genre, I'd say it was a puzzle game for the most part (although there are some light platforming sections that are in the game but never really get too diffficult). There is a character that you interact with (which I won't spoil) that reminded me of Glad0s from portal with how sadistic yet funny they were. In fact, the entire game has a great sense of humor. The only problem I have with it is that it is a little on the short side. Although there are some collectibles that extend the life of the game, going through main game without getting them can be done in about a couple of hours. So be warned that if you're expecting this game to keep you engaged for tons of hours you may end up disappointed. But, if you're just looking for a game with great quality for a few hours then you should pick this one up. I give it a solid 8/10 for it's creativity and being a nearly flawless game.","January 5","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It has some hacking elements similar to the mini puzzles in Digital: A Love Story, but instead of being mostly interactive fiction it's a simple arcade game. Then occasionally it's a programming/puzzle game.\n\nAn interesting twist for this type of game is that instead of revealing spookiness behind a facade it starts with everything being broken and satanic.

It's a hard game to review  because giving any details about it would end up in me spoiling it. If I had to give this game a genre, I'd say it was a puzzle game for the most part (although there are some light platforming sections that are in the game but never really get too diffficult). There is a character that you interact with (which I won't spoil) that reminded me of Glad0s from portal with how sadistic yet funny they were. In fact, the entire game has a great sense of humor. The only problem I have with it is that it is a little on the short side. Although there are some collectibles that extend the life of the game, going through main game without getting them can be done in about a couple of hours. So be warned that if you're expecting this game to keep you engaged for tons of hours you may end up disappointed. But, if you're just looking for a game with great quality for a few hours then you should pick this one up. I give it a solid 8/10 for it's creativity and being a nearly flawless game.","January 5","true","2.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This one is more about the journey and the writing than the "gameplay" but poking around and finding how to progress is pretty fun, lots of puzzles. The writing for some of the characters is pretty solid too, though no one sticks around for too long.\n\nOnly real complaint is it's short (3 hours?) but the price matches the length just fine. Doesn't waste your time, which I find to be a bigger problem than being too short.

Pony Island may be one of the most interesting, and one of the most fun game released so far, and it's only the fourth day of the year. If gaming keeps going this way, this may be a huge redemption, and Pony Island is just the start.\n\nThe game switches between genres. It initially starts off as a sort of puzzle game where you use timing, critical thinking, and precision to place tiles that maneuver a cursor over to a correct line of text that modifies the game itself. The second part of the game is a simple platformer where you play as an actual pony, where you can unlock wings and a projectile to fire. The platforming itself is simple, and does have some rather difficult parts, but the puzzles are easy to learn and hard to master. There's a lot of trial and error in this game which requires you to use your head, and like the game description says, think outside the box. Sometimes literally.\n\nWithout spoiling this game, (yes, Pony Island has a plot.) you take control of a person trying to play a game called "Pony Island". But when you start off, the new game button won't start a new game. How do you fix this? Go to the options menu, and you'll see some pretty regular options. Anti-aliasing, sound volume, a code in binary, and an odd symbol to name a few. Once you find the option to fix the menu, things start to get... grim. You suddenly get harrassed by a being that is known as "HIM", or as he calls himself, "Lucifer". Lucifer wants to stop you from progressing down his little rabbit hole and simply wants your soul, you see. So, really, the wise choice is to ignore him. But he won't go down without a fight. But there is a lot more to Pony Island than just a malicious being inside...\nBut that's for you to find out on your own.\n\nWould I recommend Pony Island? To those looking for a game with a fresh concept and good tension, absolutely. For the ones with epilepsy? I'd stay away.","January 4","true","1.8"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

I would recommend this game to gamers who enjoy being toyed with and gamers who love Puzzle/Cryptic solving games.\n\nI would avoid this game if you get easily stuck with Puzzle games or just looking for ponies.

That's a rather incidental aspect of the game. If it was solely about cute ponies jumping over stuff I wouldn't have wanted to play/review it.\n\nDisclaimer #2: I was provided press-access to Pony Island by the developer.  My opinions are my own.\n\nIt's a brand new year and I was so stoked to have it start out with PONY ISLAND. Just for the fact I never thought I'd type that out in a review; but this game surprised me in a ton of ways and I chalk it up to the developer's ability to disarm me and then throw something crazy at me from left field.\n\nIf you enjoyed games where you break the rules, like Don't Touch Anything, The Stanley Parable or The Talos Principle you will be right at hole with Pony Island.  Yes, that is some seriously great company to keep. :) Daniel Mullins who developed the game stopped by my livestream of Pony Island and was a very cool guy, as well.\n\nPony Island is a clever 4th wall breaking indie game where you don't just play a crappy platformer called Pony Islane but you have to break it and manipulate it from the inside out in order to... well, save your soul.  Yep, everything is on the line in this occult adventure.\n\nEach boss is unique and needs different skills to beat! The end sequence is really epic.\n\nPROS:\nFantastic old-school pixel graphics that hold up even as the style of the game changes so often.  I especially enjoyed the old-CRT monitior effect you see while you play a majority of the game it was pulled off very well.\nA game that rewards your curiousity! You find secrets EVERYWHERE and they are all purposful. Whether it progresses the story or leads to answering questions about the characters I spent a ton of time poking around the game to find all the hidden stuff. Pony Island tickets are collectables for serious out-of-the-box thinkers and I couldn't even find them all but was told the payoff is huge.\nPony Island has a kick ♥♥♥ soundtrack that definitely fits with the visual style. The music kicked in at the best possible moments and I was jamming to it as I played.\nFrom beginning to end I was drawn into the world of Pony Island and questioning everything.  The antagonist of the game has a great personality but your friend also leaves you with questions about motive.  In a game that is so meta it's hard to take anything for granted.\nThe actual controls are not over explained but easy to use; the mouse is used 100% for the platforming sequences but the keyboard is needed for the text based stuff.\nA fantastic hacking mini-game awaits you; it is not over explained so learning while doing was a real treat. The game amps up difficulty perfectly with the hacking games throwing just enough new stuff at you each round.  Like I said, these are a part of the overall payoff of progressing the story or finding secrets so there is a real incentive to beat the machine.\nThe price is super affordable for gamers of all types.\nPony Island trolled me harder than any game has trolled me and it was worth playing for that one moment. It was epic. It was legend.\nCONS:\nPony Island is not a long game. It graduated from a 10 minute Ludum Dare entry to about 3-4 hours in it's current finished state.\nThe last two hacking puzzles are less than ideal; they rely more on blind luck than the clever thought processes needed to solve the others.\nThe hitboxes on some of the games targets can be iffy. Luckily there isn't a huge setback when dying/hitting the wrong thing, but still.\nI am sure that most players will not be able to find all the tickets on their own. Some are so esoteric that a walkthrough would be required.\nThe disarming nature of Pony Island is going to be a big hurdle (lol) for most players given the serious bias on the internet about this type of subject matter.  This is a shame as it has a lot to offer.\nI highly recommend playing Pony Island.  It was made with a lot of detail and care and I had a blast beating it.  While it won't appeal to everyone I think this niche indie title deserves some serious kudos.","January 4","true","6.2"," 21 of 42 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","21","42","3","4"

It's a game about a game about ponies made by Satan. And as much as that sounds like the terrible pitch of a 14 year old, it actually works pretty well. The first act is kinda cheesy, but since the game makes no attempt to conceal what it actually is that works out fine. The second act may feel a bit tedious at points, but trust me that it doesn't last and the game finishes strong.\n\nIf I have a complaint, it's that the puzzles are not particularly difficult or interesting. There's one that threw me a little and was not very satisfying when I did complete it, but otherwise they're all pretty easy. The "Pony Island" gameplay is pretty reasonable and only briefly dips into tedium in the second act, otherwise remaining a light challenge that is nevertheless engaging.\n\nI suspect there's a lot of hidden material I didn't find, and probably an ARG burried in there too, if that's your bag.","January 9","true","2.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's pretty long, so here's a TL;DR:\nIf you want to try something different OR if you liked Stanley Parable, this is a must buy, imho.\n____________________________________________\nDisclaimer: Key provided by the developer for review purposes.\n\nIt's hard to write a completely spoiler-free review for this game, since basically everything is a spoiler here. Have you seen description on Pony Island's steam page? Well, that's a spoiler, too…right? Anyway, I haven't read anything more than that before I jumped into it…that, and also I knew there will be a couple of weird twists along the way. Would my experience with Pony Island differ substantialy, if I didn't know even that much, I wonder? Well, honestly, I probably wouldn't give a rats ♥♥♥ about it, like anyone who doesn't care about unicorns (btw, why are they called ponies nowadays? someone please explain this to me…please.)\n\nLong story short, your goal is to figure out who you are, why has Satan inprisoned you in his game and how to set yourself free. Gameplay consists of nothing more, than…well..a set of minigames. It doesn't sound particularly interesting, does it? Two of the minigames you'll encounter the most are the hacking puzzle minigame, and the runner segment, where you have to jump over obstacles, as one does. And to be honest…these are terrible, especially the runner one. It's absolutely primitive, it doesn't present player any real challenge, and therefore, it can't be rewarding. There's nothing to these things. Nothing.\n\n…And that's the point, isn't it? After all, you're a prisoner of devil's machine. The game is supposed to be your eternal torment. The real genius of Pony Island lies in the narrative that connects these elements, providing experience that you've maybe never went through in a videogame before.\n\n\nI wrote "maybe" there. It's not that long ago, when a lot of people were excited about a similar game - Stanley Parable. (I guess I could mention Undertale here, but I won't since I haven't played it…). Stanley Parable, the game that was consistently breaking the fourth wall, adressing the player, refererencing itself and the its creators. The choices presented to the player were merely an illusion. It was provokative and urged us to ask ourselves: is this a videogame? What is a videogame, exactly? What do we really expect from videogames?\n\nAfter playing Pony Island for the first few minutes, Stanley came to mind. It uses similar tricks, which are still pretty novel, even though other games have attempted/used these before. "Breaking of the fourth wall" as a term is adherent to theater and cinematography, but the way Pony Island (or similar games) can utilize these principles is something, that is only possible thanks to interactive nature of videogames.\n\nPony Island is very linear, it guides you to where it wants you to be. It let's you see the glimpses of story every now and then. There's more to it than it seems at first glance. You'll quickly figure out there something more outside of the devils game, despite him trying the best he can to stop you. In your attempts to escape, you'll have to destroy a couple of core files of the game. That's where afformentioned hacking minigame comes into play. It's not terrible, but it isn't really challenging. It's OK, I guess.\n\nHowever, the important thing is…hacking makes you a cheater. And let's be frank here, cheating feels good, doesn't it? It's thrilling. A little bit of cheating is fine…just a little bit.  You're cheating against the devil himself! Isn't that incredible? HELL YEAH it is! (heh)\n\nThere's a chatch, though.\n\nDevil sees you. He knows what you're up to.\n\nAs you progress, a lot of tricks and surprises await. Some of them are incredibly clever, but even the cheapest tricks don't feel…as cheap? It is very clear that the developer is fully aware how lazy and cheap they are. He's just messing with you, he winks at you. And that makes all the difference.\nHe's making fun of game mechanics we know, and generally, the things that we've learned to expect from videogames. Pony Island uses them to progress the story, while constantly mocking you and crushing your expectations. That's why I think that people have to have some experience with videogames to really enjoy this one. I'd say it is kind of a "minimal requirement" you have to meet, otherwise it's pointless.\n\nIt's a pretty short experience, where it will take you roughly 3 hours to get through the main thing. You won't know the whole truth by the end of it though, so there's some replayability for you. A good thing is you can access a specific part (or as they are called here, "acts"), instead of playing the whole thing through. But after you've seen most of the game, it's just not that great anymore, you know. The element of surprise is mostly gone, although there are still some surprises left. I guess my main gripe with Pony Island is that even though there still stuff to explore in the game, I just don't feel the drive to complete it. I'm glad I'm done with those repetitive, godawful runner segments. It's over. Finally…I'm free…\n\nSpeaking of runner segments, the is the real Pony Island… Yes, I understand that that was the punishment I had to go through. I get it…but still, I feel like there was too much of it, and that it was the weakest link. On the other hand, these repetitive and boring segments dumbed me down enough to get surprised again and again, when game actually did something cool. The more I think about it, I realise how devilishly briliant (ok, I'm done with puns, I promise) design decision that is…but still, I'm torn on it. Is this my punishment too? Is this the real punishment?\n\nIt doesn't matter. The fact alone that I'm forced to question my own opinion makes Pony Island more interesting title than it has any right to be. It's not flawless, but I'm not sure if it's reasonable to expect perfection from a 5$ experimental indie game. There were moments when I felt like Pony Island set the bar too high for itself. I knew it could do better, because I was already spoiled. Pony Island spoiled me, and than let me down. He never called me back, even when he promissed he would.\nWas all of that by design? I don't know, but I felt like it was breaking the immersion. Was that the point? I don't know. I just don't..I don't know anything anymore…\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you're not sure if 5$ is a reasonable amount to pay for a anusual 3 hours long experience, I can't solve that problem for you. If you've read the whole thing through, at this point, you should already have an idea if you'd enjoy this game or not. But what I'm sure about is that if you're looking for a game with great gameplay and replayability, this isn't the one to buy. You only buy this game if you want to experience something different, surprising and mindboggling. Pony Island is great even at times when it's the most boring thing you could possibly play, and that's a hard thing to pull off I feel.\nThere are games where you feel smart when you find a solution to a problem, or overcome some obstacle. Pony Island is the game where you feel like it's creator wants you to know that he is smart, because he probably is.\n\nIn Soviet Russia, Pony Island plays you.\n\nOverall score: 8.5\n\n+ presentation\n+ intelligent and witty narrative\n+ unique experience\n+ everything has a purpose\n+ consistently surprising\n\n- lack of motivation after completing the main part (this is probably a personal thing)\n- linearity\n- one too many runner segments","January 22","true","4.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Just... amazing. There are no words to describe it.\n\nYou are welcomed by two purple ponies who surround the letters "Pony Island". This game is a great way to experience alicorn powers, including meeting some extraordinary characters in-game.\n\nYou are an pony, frolicking and leaping over gates. This game is a way to show true beauty and friendliness in the best way possible.\n\n\nPony Island is really interesting. You learn a lot in-game and make new 'friends'. It makes you 'wtf' all the way. I mean, the start is obviously very misleading, but the trailers include actual gameplay that makes you re-think your choices, which is also a good way to understand games. At the start of Pony Island, I knew what I was getting into. Some parts actually made me want to lend my soul to Satan (yes, it's actually very sad if you think about it, smh) which is mind-boggling. The way this game can control the real you without actually controlling you surprises me.\n\nIt's a good way to learn how to puzzle, too.\n\nI recommend you do NOT watch any videos on people playing it, (a mistake, I have done it) it'll ruin all the fun and excitement.\n\nOverall, this game is pretty good, def. recommend it.\n\nThe saddest thing is that trackpad gameplay is hard, (I'm using a trackpad, and I'm still in adventure mode!) and if you don't have a mouse it can be challenging. Although, challenging is fun sometimes. x)","February 8","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/405640/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","Below is a review and comparison of Pony Island and similar game Calendula.\n\nBoth Pony Island and the less well know Calendula have come out recently and both games are similar in the sense they are ‘Meta’ puzzle games featuring a self-aware game that is trying to stop you from being able to play it.\n\nThe general premise is playing what looks like an early Spectrum game called Pony Island and the game is trying to capture your soul. While the game itself is about jumping a cute white unicorn over some fences the bulk of the game is spent navigating the glitch infested menus trying to actually progress with the game trying to trip you up at every possible opportunity.\n\nA lot of the puzzles involve moving around code to get a set of rotating instructions to finally reach the end of the code.\n\nThis starts off very cool but I must say towards the latter stages of the game it became a bit tiresome. This game is truly a mix of really stand out unusual moments alongside some tasks that start exciting and then quickly get a little on the repetitive side.\n\nThat being said during the back end of the game things take a little bit of a turn for the crazy and really pep up.\n\nComparing this to Calendula which on the face of it  is a bit less flashy and definitely less complicated. In Calendula you are trying to play a game and load save files. Most of the save files are password protected and you must do a number of different tasks to work out each password whilst the self-aware game tries to screw with you.\n\nEvery time you manage to load a save file you walkthrough a small section of trippy horror game before being kicked back out to the main screen. The best way I can describe the visual style of this game is a computer game version of the video in the Ring. Put it this way I am going to be keeping an eye on any wet pale dark haired girls for the next few weeks.\n\nThe key difference is the puzzles in Calendula are a little bit less like puzzles and more working things out by manipulating the menu screens and playing with the settings. While I can see a lot of people will find this game a lot more simplistic than Pony Island I actually found the more natural less contrived puzzles of this game more enjoyable than the more obvious puzzles of Pony Island.\n\nSo which one to play? Both games are good and well worth a play through and both are different enough to warrant some attention on their own merits. Both are cheap and neither outstay their welcome. If you must pick Pony Island is a little bit more of a puzzle game and Calendula is more of a detective game.\n\nBoth however are good fun that I would definitely recommend picking up if you fancy something a little bit different.\n\nPlease check out our comparison video below if you would like to know more...\n\nhttp://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-compares/160207_game-tutor-compares-pony-island-and-calendula\n","February 6","true","4.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hiding behind the guise of a cutsey side-scroller, Pony Island is a game about attempting to fix or escape an arcade cabinet that was crafted by the devil himself. Your mission involves abusing the games mechanics, changing the flow of code, and beating the actual game by any means necessary.\n\nPony Island won't go down without a fight! The cabinet constantly changes the rules, spawning enemies to slow your progress and torturing you by locking certain elements of the game, or straight-up crashing itself or enabling security protocols to keep you out of important parts of Pony Island's programming.\n\nI've always had a facsination with games that brought up the idea of being self-aware, and Pony Island is a great example of this. You're never certain if the machine in the game is talking to you or your character, which adds a whole new level of creepiness and paranoia to this already grim game.\n\nPony Island doesn't punish the player permanently, and the difficulty level is pretty solid for a possesed puzzle sidescroller. There is enough challenge to guarantee you'll fail a few times, but it's not so infuriating that you want to give up after a few tries. The only issue I had with the game was my mouse leaving the screen on the side-scolling\nparts of the game, and that was fixed after I stopped taking huge strides with my mouse and clicking in my second monitor.\n\nOverall, if you like interesting puzzle games, and you're interested in the demonic side of game crafting, you couldn't have a better game to play than Pony Island!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAYMoSokJ0","January 5","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Then again, all of this meta-game horror was being done 5 years ago by 9 Hours 9 Persons 9 Doors which you probably didn't play, AND 14 years ago by that masterpiece psychological horror game you definitely never played called Sanity's Requiem.\n\nDon't get me wrong; this game is rad and you should buy it. Just, you know, play Sanity's Requiem and 999 and Undertale first.\n\n01110100010101/101010100101101","January 12","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not in terms of quality: graphics, sound and programming are all perfectly fine, and generally used effectively. The problem is conceptual. The game starts off with a lot of interesting ideas and then just never really goes anywhere with them, resulting in something that feels more like a really, really well-developed game jam idea than a full, honest to goodness game.\n\nThat said, I hope this is only the first of many from this dev team.

It's a game about ponies, and yet at the exact same time, it's not.  It's a bit difficult to describe the game without spoiling anything, but here's the main gist of what you should know about the game.\n\nPony Island is a puzzle game that revolves around the gimmick of trying to "break" the game.  You are playing an arcade game devised by Satan himself and he is doing everything in his power to mess with you and give you a horrible time.  Therefore, your goal is to beat the devil at his own game and break his game before the game can break you and steal your soul.  It's a game of two cheaters combating against one another and seeing who comes out on top.  And though you'll think your tactics are great and you'll be accomplishing much, you'll be very surprised to what lengths Satan will go to in order to break you.\n\nIt's a short play, clocking in a little under 3 hours for me, but I felt it was well worth the 5 dollars.  So if you have a little extra cash on you and want to have an interesting and potentially unnerving time, give Pony Island a try.","January 13","true","4.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LoganicPlays/recommended/405640/","LoganicPlays","LoganicPlays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LoganicPlays/","449 products in account","Full Disclosure: I was given a copy of Pony Island by the developers, as can be seen by my gameplay in the videos and screenshots section of the page.\n\nPony Island is a strange, yet refreshing experience in a time where games try to be more than they have to be to catch the eyes of gamers. Hiding behind the guise of a cutsey side-scroller, Pony Island is a game about attempting to fix or escape an arcade cabinet that was crafted by the devil himself. Your mission involves abusing the games mechanics, changing the flow of code, and beating the actual game by any means necessary.\n\nPony Island won't go down without a fight! The cabinet constantly changes the rules, spawning enemies to slow your progress and torturing you by locking certain elements of the game, or straight-up crashing itself or enabling security protocols to keep you out of important parts of Pony Island's programming.\n\nI've always had a facsination with games that brought up the idea of being self-aware, and Pony Island is a great example of this. You're never certain if the machine in the game is talking to you or your character, which adds a whole new level of creepiness and paranoia to this already grim game.\n\nPony Island doesn't punish the player permanently, and the difficulty level is pretty solid for a possesed puzzle sidescroller. There is enough challenge to guarantee you'll fail a few times, but it's not so infuriating that you want to give up after a few tries. The only issue I had with the game was my mouse leaving the screen on the side-scolling\nparts of the game, and that was fixed after I stopped taking huge strides with my mouse and clicking in my second monitor.\n\nOverall, if you like interesting puzzle games, and you're interested in the demonic side of game crafting, you couldn't have a better game to play than Pony Island!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAYMoSokJ0","January 5","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Hiding behind the guise of a cutsey side-scroller, Pony Island is a game about attempting to fix or escape an arcade cabinet that was crafted by the devil himself. Your mission involves abusing the games mechanics, changing the flow of code, and beating the actual game by any means necessary.\n\nPony Island won't go down without a fight! The cabinet constantly changes the rules, spawning enemies to slow your progress and torturing you by locking certain elements of the game, or straight-up crashing itself or enabling security protocols to keep you out of important parts of Pony Island's programming.\n\nI've always had a facsination with games that brought up the idea of being self-aware, and Pony Island is a great example of this. You're never certain if the machine in the game is talking to you or your character, which adds a whole new level of creepiness and paranoia to this already grim game.\n\nPony Island doesn't punish the player permanently, and the difficulty level is pretty solid for a possesed puzzle sidescroller. There is enough challenge to guarantee you'll fail a few times, but it's not so infuriating that you want to give up after a few tries. The only issue I had with the game was my mouse leaving the screen on the side-scolling\nparts of the game, and that was fixed after I stopped taking huge strides with my mouse and clicking in my second monitor.\n\nOverall, if you like interesting puzzle games, and you're interested in the demonic side of game crafting, you couldn't have a better game to play than Pony Island!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZAYMoSokJ0","January 5","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You will be toyed with, played with and have your brains picked as you try and navigate your way through the levels.  It was not far until I got stuck but unlike most people I'm pretty dumb. The 'static' vibe to the game got me pretty scared. The game revolves around mouse and keyboard. So using controllers/gamepads will not work well.\n\nPositives:\n+ Challenging\n+ Dark Twist\n+ Puzzles are fun\n+ Game is not what I expected it to be\n+ Music and Atmosphere created in the game\n\nNegatives:\n- Not really clear, if you are stuck it will probably be the end of the game for you (Unless you look up a walkthrough)\n- The frame can be annoying\n- Sometimes the graphics disorientate me\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the darkness and being messed with as the Devil manipulates you as you try and progress. I would recommend this game to gamers who enjoy being toyed with and gamers who love Puzzle/Cryptic solving games.\n\nI would avoid this game if you get easily stuck with Puzzle games or just looking for ponies. The game is very unique and that means it may not appeal to a lot of people due to its setting but I would recommend this game to all.\n\nI have added a video preview to give you a better idea of the game.\n\nThanks again.\n","January 4","true","2.5"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","16","32","2","2"

There are two types of gameplay, one involving puzzles (Yay!) and one involving boring and repetitive platforming (Nay...). I get the vibe that it's aiming for the same sort of teritory as Undertale, but Undertale worked because the weird mechanics and 4th wall breaking were incorperated well into the story and characterisation. In this, the gameplay often feels completely seperate to the plot, and the antaganists do not feel particularly ominous. I like the idea of villains taking over the game, with the player losing control, but I feel it could have been pushed further. At no point did I ever feel panicked or caught off guard. On the other hand, this game is only £4, won't take up much of your time, and a lot of people seem to like it.","April 3","false","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What it actually is is a devil-possessed mind-trip of a puzzle game that will have you begging for death, if you're not already dead.\n\nBut no, really, it's a pretty inventive puzzle game with some really intriguing and unique aspects.  It's hard to put this into words, so take a look at the first ~15 minutes of the game in action:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UChkseayFx8\n\n*Adding more because I keep getting thumbed down as unhelpful.  Let's fix that!\n\nI originally left this review mostly empty because the game really needs to be experienced first-hand, the way The Stanley Parable or The Beginner's Guide really needs to be experienced first-hand.  While it is neither of those games, they're good references for explaining the way Pony Island tries to screw with you.\n\nThe game starts off innocent enough but it quickly derails into the machinations of a demon who really just wants nothing more than for you to play his game.  Desperately.  The problem is, he's not a very good game designer AND he keeps asking for your soul so you have no choice but to keep being a ♥♥♥♥ to him.\n\nThat's the premise in a nutshell.  As far as gameplay goes, it's a mouse-driven puzzle game.  Various minigames (along with an ever evolving puzzle game) make up your tasks.  It's a completely weird experience, but a fun one.  Simple, but diverse.\n\nKey provided by developer and Dietrich Online Services.","January 4","true","1.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","0"

It's quick to mess with your perception and expectations of how games work and play, and little moments in both the game and story will leave you wondering if you’re playing the game or it’s playing you. It takes between 1-2 hours to complete the game, story and achievements and all, so the otherwise simple mechanics don't feel like they're overstaying their welcome. Also, I feel the experience is greater if you go in blind; try to avoid spoilers, especially for the third half of the game.","January 22","true","3.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Im glad this game came out because all you see is FPS and RPG games but pony island is unique.Also it was fun going back to the game and trying to find all the easter eggs (like for example,To find all the tickets and the missing no, which was the most difficult to find, but it was fun).It even had great humor in the game (not telling you when cuz i dont spoil games).thats it....\n\nGraphics- isnt really something people would care about in this game since its kinda 8bit.Luckly, its not E.T from the atari and the game has good graphics.\n\nStory- There has to be a lore in this game (something like the fnaf series).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQUESTIONS:\n\nCould you describe the game in 3 words? - Cute,Funny,Satanic!\n\nWould you rate this game 11/10 - For an indie game,Yes.\n\nis the game worth it? - for 5 dollars uhh yeah,since the game last about 2-4 hours depending how aware you are in the game.\n\nIm religious and idk if i should play the game..Should i? - If it bothers you that much then dont play it. But if you dont care then play the indie game...its good.\n\n\nDoes it contain pop-ups (or jump scares)? - No it doesnt trust me, I thought it would but turns out its A-ok!\n\n\nAre the acheivements hard to get? Well If you look around hard enough, You'll eventually find them\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI STRONGLY recommend this game to be played with other people and to turn off those lights to have a better experience.\nOne more thing before you go on with your day, If you're religious and get offended relating to god,Dont play it because since this game is very satanic.\n\nOther than that enjoy the game and thank you for reading my review!  -TheMainEngineer","January 6","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I came in blind, didn't even see the trailer. Once I realized I was playing a horror game of sorts, I expected to get bad creepypasta, and I absolutely got better than that. It's tongue-in-cheek, and while that makes me roll my eyes from time to time, most of the time it works well. Puzzles aren't obtuse, there's an appropriate degree of silliness (ie not too much), and exploring the broken machine is satisfying.\n\nIt's definitely not without its flaws. The narrative shines when progressing, but all of the extra information you can get on the side (not just about the player character) feels meaningless to me at best, and complete nonsense at worst. And not that Undertale was the first game to keep track of things across multiple playthroughs, but it feels forced here and not nearly as elegant and meaningful as it was in that game. All the parallels to Undertale do this game a disservice, but they're being drawn for a reason; there are specific lines in Pony Island that made me cringe, they wanted so badly to be as good as Undertale's version of that line.\n\nI wouldn't say it's a must-play, but it's much better than I expected. I'd like to think it says more that it drew me in and made me want to collect every ticket, reveal the whole backstory, etc. than that I was dissatisfied with what I got from doing it.

Im glad this game came out because all you see is FPS and RPG games but pony island is unique.Also it was fun going back to the game and trying to find all the easter eggs (like for example,To find all the tickets and the missing no, which was the most difficult to find, but it was fun).It even had great humor in the game (not telling you when cuz i dont spoil games).thats it....\n\nGraphics- isnt really something people would care about in this game since its kinda 8bit.Luckly, its not E.T from the atari and the game has good graphics.\n\nStory- There has to be a lore in this game (something like the fnaf series).\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nQUESTIONS:\n\nCould you describe the game in 3 words? - Cute,Funny,Satanic!\n\nWould you rate this game 11/10 - For an indie game,Yes.\n\nis the game worth it? - for 5 dollars uhh yeah,since the game last about 2-4 hours depending how aware you are in the game.\n\nIm religious and idk if i should play the game..Should i? - If it bothers you that much then dont play it. But if you dont care then play the indie game...its good.\n\n\nDoes it contain pop-ups (or jump scares)? - No it doesnt trust me, I thought it would but turns out its A-ok!\n\n\nAre the acheivements hard to get? Well If you look around hard enough, You'll eventually find them\n\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS:\nI STRONGLY recommend this game to be played with other people and to turn off those lights to have a better experience.\nOne more thing before you go on with your day, If you're religious and get offended relating to god,Dont play it because since this game is very satanic.\n\nOther than that enjoy the game and thank you for reading my review!  -TheMainEngineer","January 6","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I kept playing in the hopes that it would throw a huge curveball that would redeem the whole experience and make it worth the 5 euros that I spent on it... then it just ended.

I've already completed it, unless you count the achievements and little secrets. I just never felt immersed enough to care about getting them, you can find out why it's all happening etc but I just.. don't care. How am I supposed to invest time on something I have no real cares for? I actually found what happens if you collect all the tickets on youtube and the result is very underwhelming in my opinion...\n\nIt was pretty darn easy - there's the main mechanic of the bouncing butt stallion, then there's the puzzle side of it. I only got stuck once, and even then it was only for about... 10 minutes? (not to mention I was playing at gone midnight so sleep addled)\n\nThe ending was predictable, I saw it coming a thousand ponies away.\n\nThe music wasn't great. I mean it's not the worst I've heard but it's not great. I wouldn't pay the extra money for the soundtrack... I don't even remember any of the music anymore to be honest, so it's just not memorable for me.\n\n\nPros:\n\nIt's cheap. I mean yes it's short but for the a higher price a cinema could've ripped me off for a film about half the length so it's not like the money is.. completely wasted.\n\nThere are some moments, while few and far between, that can really throw you for a loop. There's one particular "boss" that might as well go around with a dang trollface on him. And I approve.\n\n\nNeutral:\n\nGraphics. I mean really on a game like this you can't put them as a positive or negative 'cos they're just.. how they are. Just make sure you personally like the kind of graphics they are and it's fine. I like some of the glitched out effects there are though.\n\n\nConclusion: Kinda wish I'd just watched someone else play it, the immersion isn't really there for me. I get the feeling some of the hype around this game has blown it a bit out of proportion though. I regret not finishing it quicker so I could get my money back.","January 17","false","3.1"," 22 of 46 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","22","46","0","0"

It is really hard to review it because it is very weird and you should know very little going in.\n\nThis game is unlike any other game I have ever played, and I knew nothing about it going in. This game is not about ponies. You are playing an arcade game that keeps glitching out, so you fix it. Then it crashes, and you find yourself on the desktop, and you start receiving strange messages. And you learn that there is more to that pony game that you first thought.\n\nThe story is really gripping, and I played the entire game in one sitting, for a total of almost three hours of gameplay. Some choices that you make are also carried over in the next playthrough, in a similar way to Undertale. The sounds are also very effective, and there are many secrets to discover.\n\nOverall, this game is a great thought provoking experience that messes with the player's mind. I think that if you like weird games like The Stanley Parable or you like games about video games, you are going to love this game. It is also very cheap, making this a must buy for any indie game fan.\n\nStory: 9\nGraphics: 9\nGameplay: 10\nChallenge: 4\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 8.5\n\nENJOYMENT: 9\nFRUSTRATION: 2\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","January 4","true","5.4"," 16 of 34 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","16","34","2","0"

However, I still agree with my old criticism as a whole: PI does not live up to either its promising beginning or its ambitions of medium commentary.\n\nPony Island advertises itself as a horror game, essentially using the "Pony Island" aesthetic as juxtapostion to make itself that much creepier.  From the steam page all the way through the game, Pony Island tries to put more beneath the surface than is immediately apparent.  However, while this brilliantly acontributes to the games unsettling atmosphere early on in the game, the story reaches beyond the skill of the writing, resulting in a dissapointing and ultimately skippable experience.\n\nYour main gameplay will consist of playing Pony Island, which requires increasingly precise jumping and aiming of your ranged attack, and the Coding sections, in which you solve puzzles in your quest against the game itself.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game. I enjoyed it quite a lot.  But my pleasant feelings drained quickly as the game concludes.\n\nThe developer was clearly not content with leaving the story as it was, and tries to reach for "meta commentary" that is neither consistent with the game's lore nor interesting.  Aside from some oddly humourous asides, the game has no more to say about video games than Undertale, and does so in a much less entertaining fashion, mainly due to the lack of meaningfull interaction with any interesting characters.\n\nThe game is cheap and will give you a few hours of enjoyment.  However if you are anything like me, the clear potential lost [edit: ad hominem attack was here] will take more away than the good begining ever gave.  Regardless of whether youre looking for puzzles, horror, or meta medium commentary, you would be better off looking elsewhere.","January 27","false","2.2"," 15 of 32 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","15","32","0","4"

Repetitive in order to fill it's vacant parts only to bare the developer artistic erectile dysfunction. The game is too afraid to explore it's own ideas, too scared to move outside it's well established medium. It's even more sad that the game makes fun of things it deliberatly uses a minute later in order to artificially increase it's time footprint. It's satire is weak enough even without the game being prime and worst example of all the issues it makes fun of. The game tries too hard to create another layer of creative abstraction it stretches itself thin, stumbes across itself and then faceplants in the most unfunny and boring way. And it's not even self-aware. Like a 13yo girl trying to be edgy and artsy AF on her facebook. Because you need smart content in order for this to work, be actually self-aware, or at very least have well thought writting. As you might guessed Pony Island is a dumb game, lacks self-awareness, and has writting of elementary school caliber with an obligatory bit of 'scary spooky skeletons'. It's not even 'so bad it's good', it's just bad. It has tremendous pacing issues on top of that so it's simply boring.\nPony Island is just an unfunny useless trinket that for some unknown reason became an injustified paid-for product. Are you that easy to impress?\n\nIn conclusion: a meta-game that miserably fails at both being 'meta' and 'game'. Want a real fourth-wall breaking horror experience? Buy Imscared.\n\nNote: Just to be fair asmodeus.exe encounter is brilliant. It's 5 minutes long though.","February 12","false","4.1"," 14 of 30 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","14","30","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s15cb/recommended/405640/","s15cb","Blizzard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s15cb/","113 products in account","I dunno. It's not a bad game. It might be the two reviews I read that ruined it for me. The two snippets I got were about "thinking outside the box" and "just go in blind, you'll get the most enjoyment that way," which to me seem like definite good signs when I'm looking to buy a game. I was excited, and ready to be hit over the head with something brilliant. I played through it in one sitting, and I finished feeling pretty underwhelmed. At the end of the game, you're encouraged to delete the game from your HDD once you're done playing it. My reaction to this encouragement was, "don't mind if I do," and that was that.\n\nSo the game, of course, is not about ponies. The title of "Pony Island" is part of the overly cheerful facade that the game literally immediately tears down the instant you start. You're going on a journey with the goal of figuring out what exactly is going on, all while playing through some minigames and fighting the big baddie. But this process is painfully linear. If you think to do something that seems like it wasn't part of the intended linear path, you're typically rewarded with a ticket (tickets don't do anything other than net you Steam achievements) or some tongue-in-cheek joke. And then you hop right back on that path because you've gotten your reward for straying from it. I have nothing against linear storylines where the player doesn't interact with anything going on, and that method has worked fine for other games. But if there's going to be a linear and uninteractive story, it has to be good. And it is not good - it is mediocre. The plot is straightforward and unengaging. I found myself feeling apathetic when moments meant to evoke a response came up. Maybe I was just in a bad mood or feeling grumpy or something, but the story just didn't work for me.\n\nAnd the gameplay is awful. The two core gameplay elements - a "hacking" puzzle and a hurdle-jumping platformer - are painfully boring. You can figure out what you need to do in a matter of seconds for both of them, and then you have to spend a minute or two executing that plan. If you mess up, you get to enjoy going all the way back to the start. Over the course of the game, new elements are added to these games as an effort to keep things fresh, but both minigames are so one-dimensional that it takes all of 15 seconds to have a solid understanding of what was just added, and then you're back to the grind. Now to be fair, the gameplay is clearly not the focus of this game. You're not buying the game to have fun jumping hurdles or solving rudimentary puzzles. You're buying the game for the rest of what's packed into it. But the literal and metaphorical hurdle-jumping of the gameplay just takes up so much time that it's hard to forgive it for being so dull, even if it's not the focus of the game.\n\nI really wanted to like this game. I just can't. It doesn't do anything new, and it doesn't improve on what has already been done. It's not bad, but it's not good either. It's meh. A resounding meh.","January 24","false","1.9"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","8","18","0","0"

For a game that's "not about ponies" I sure spent a lot of time running around as a pony, jumping obstacles and shooting laser beams from my mouth. Yes, there were some other puzzles, but maybe not enough non-pony activity. The game did earn a couple of well-deserved laughs, and there's a mystery in there I'd sure like the answer to, but to get that answer means I'd have to play it more, and I don't want that. Three hours is more than enough.","February 5","false","3.3"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/recommended/405640/","feuerzeuge","fleur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/feuerzeuge/","211 products in account","This game has some really neat moments, but I would only really say it's above average at best, as the few really cool moments are adrift in a sea of not a whole lot else. I don't feel I wasted my money, but I wasn't really dazzled, either - if possible, I would have given it a thumbs sideways. This review will include vague and mild spoilers.\n\nThe tone is a lot more lighthearted than I was expecting going into it blind, and the shooty jumpy puzzly bits can get repetitive after a while, but some of the stuff it pulls is downright brilliant. If I had to level any criticism at the game beyond what I've already mentioned, it's that it didn't go far enough. The narrative looked like it was going to go to a pretty weird place for a moment, and there were a few knowing winks and nods at the fourth wall, but by the end it settles down comfortably within the confines of conventionality. There's a bit of a payoff, but it's not much, and it really feels like meta for the sake of meta without much thought put into it.\n\nThe game's second biggest problems are the tone and the muddled focus, as well as the overall lack of a cohesive narrative. You play as a guy playing an arcade game. All the same, you as the player are also recognized as a participant in the story. I wouldn't say that the game is about the player character - he has no agency within the story to speak of, and we do not learn anything about him or his personality, goals or indeed character, beyond a few bits of biographical trivia locked inside some hidden areas. When we actually find out his identity, the revelation only hinders our ability to identify with him, and further distances the player from the player character. He ends up being neither someone we can easily self-insert as, nor a freestanding character of his own, which left me wondering why he was there to begin with. There's another actor in this story, but he's more of a plot device than an actual character, so I wouldn't really factor him in.\n\nThe game isn't about you, the player, either. Beyond the quick wink and the nod, it does not engage with you or speak to your experience, and the game certainly doesn't become about you - it looks like it might, but then it goes right on back to focusing on the personalityless cipher of your player character. It doesn't even comment on the fact that you're controlling him.\n\nOf all the characters in the game, Satan gets the most development, but his motivations seem muddled and unclear, and whatever development we see is undermined in the end, possibly because the developer wanted to have a climactic sequence. Satan isn't really scary, either. Neither is any of the rest of game. What seemed to get off to a promising start is undermined by the fact that we see far too much of him, that he's petty and that he's entirely ineffectual. He felt like a Saturday morning cartoon villain. Not a force beyond your reckoning against whose machinations you are entirely helpless, but a petty chatterbox and a complete pushover. Were he more aloof, more powerful and more sparingly used, I might've actually been afraid of him, but I'm afraid that wasn't the case.\n\nLikewise, the tone of this game is all over the place. It doesn't know if it wants to be funny or unsettling, and it kind of fails at both. There were a few sequences that got some hearty chuckles out of me, but there was not one instance of uproarious belly laughter. Nor was I really creeped out at any point. Religious horror relies hugely on exploiting the solemnity and gravity of religious symbols to induce fear. Moments of levity undermine that unless they're turned against the player - it shouldn't laugh with you, it should laugh at you. When you laugh too, it should grab you by the head and push your nose into it like you just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the carpet, all the while laughing at your expense. That you're a sinner, that you're filthy, that you're excluded, beyond all hope of salvation, that's what you should be feeling. Sometimes it feels like it's going to go all the way with that, but it always gets cold feet at the last moment and bolts off while apologizing.\n\nIn the end, you have a story that's neither about you, nor your character, nor Satan, nor your helper. A story where all the obstacles are effortlessly overcome through seemingly no effort and your antagonist fumbles and stumbles comically at every step, where the stakes are poorly defined and there never seems to be any risk at all of anything truly unpleasant happening. We're playing not to see the story of a character or learn more about a world or solve a mystery - we're playing to find out where they're going with this, as the game itself aptly points out. Turns out that where they're going with this is nowhere in particular. What's left, in the end? A few really cool moments that I do think are genuinely brilliant. If you think that's worth 5 bucks, all the more power to you.","March 13","false","2.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zethariel/recommended/405640/","zethariel","Wing Dancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zethariel/","258 products in account","I wish there was a neutral rating. At the end of the day though, I do consider having fun while playing the game, so I'll role with an upvote.\n\nMy reason for not entirely being satisfied was probably because I played "The Magic Circle" before this. To me it seems like Pony Island was heavily inspired on that title, and it tried it's best but just wasn't quite there. If I put the two games side by side I can easily say which parts of Magic Circle fit where.\n\nThe game did troll me once though, and I'll have to give it that. Other than that one amusing part (which is by the end of the game mind you) you'll be treated to a lot of puzzles that are both reflex and logic based. I'd rate them as being okay, but my playtime says more than enough about the complexity of those.\n\nThe idea behind the game is of course pretty novel and I love to see these kind of titles more often, but at the end of the day Pony Island still played it's ideas on the safe side by trying to appeal to completionists (Steam achievements can spoil the story for you, and there are collectibles that I don't really care to pick up as they are not relevant to the story) and have a token deeper/hidden story that I couldn't bring myself to care for. There are a bunch of things I found illogical about it, but I'd be spoiling it if I started discussing it in the main review (I will adress that in  the comments though)\n\nMaybe I'm just spoiled by my recent play of Undertale and fond memories of The Magic Circle this game dredged up, but I'd like for this to have a deeper layer I just altogether missed - which I don't believe is the case, as the end of the game kind of made me deadpan at the flat storytelling. Again, look into the comments for an explanation, if you don't mind spoilers.\n\nTL;DR - 5 EUR is a good price and I didn't mind paying it for Pony Island. The pony was cute and setting interesting. If you like small brain-teasers and a relaxing game after work, pick this one up.\n\n","January 4","true","2.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","2"

Under the pretense of a suspence/horror game, pony island is actually extremely linear and streightforward. Peering deeper into the machine might net you a few achivements but it doesn't change anything about the story or gameplay. Even the story itself is completely face-value - once you get the basic premise, you've seen it all. 4th wall breaks were entertaining but gimmicky. Nothing has lasting impact.\n\nI'm giving this a thumbs down in spite of myself because it's only 5 bucks and probably is worth playing, but compared to other games or to what it *could* have been, it doesn't make par. I'd be interested to see it improve if the developer keeps going - there's a lot of unexplored material to expand on, and it could be really excellent given more time and more levels into the conspiracy.","February 27","false","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's good fun, and always interesting, because it supercedes the game's mechanical limitations as to what the puzzles can be.\n\nWhat I can't look past, however, is that during the two hours or so it took me to beat the game, I was unbelievably bored a good half of it. The game's insistence on the game within the game heavily overstayed its welcome, even though that might've been the point. Still, it was tedious, and I'd rather have done something else during those times, the pony game and the key puzzles.\n\nInteresting premise, but ultimately not that satisfying as an experience.","May 1","false","2.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Trust me. You're...not half wrong actually.\n\nWhile at a first glance, this may seem like a cliche Creepypasta game, the story goes further than that and provides an interesting view on game development as a whole.\n\nTo summarize, you're playing as a "soul trapped in limbo," who is forced to play a mundane endless runner involving ponies constructed by a developer who refers to himself as Satan himself, who tries on multiple occasions to trick the protagon into "giving him his soul." The protagon must hack his way out of the computer with the aid of the "Hopeless Soul."\n\nThe fourth wall is pretty much non existent in this game, but you're not behind the fourth wall, the protagon is. But don't think you're safe behind that eighth wall, because the game can take it a step further. To see what I mean, go watch Nitro Rad's review of this game.

I was bored throughout most of it.  I spent the first hour or two trudging onwards, telling myself that all the cool stuff was going to start happening eventually, and I just had to wait it out.  Before long, though, I realized that that wasn't the case—that the repetitive pony shooter really was all there was to see here.  There's some ticket-collecting gimmick here for all of the virtual crack addicts, but not much of substance—nothing that really makes you laugh, or feel things, or stop and reflect, like a good indie game would, nor is there much of a challenge.  It's just kind of... a thing that you experience.\n\nWith that, I'm left wondering what the game's appeal was supposed to be.  It's not really funny—I think I laughed a sum total of once—it's not really witty, and the music doesn't do much for me.  The game is embellished with a few meta-heavy gimmicks and a narrative of "the game is possessed by an evil force that is being a jerk to you", but the bulk of the "gameplay" is split between a gallery shooter with a laser-shooting pony, and some "put the right item in the right place at the right time" puzzles.  With slight variations, you'll go through the same kinds of puzzles and shooter stages over and over, for bulk of the 3 hours of the game.  With regards to this, I think it fair for me to summarize the game as being a one-trick pony.  (Hah!  Get it?  My joke is almost as clever as the game itself.)\n\nOn the positive side of things, the game is competent.  Stylistically, in terms of graphics and sound, it nails the atmosphere that it's going for.  However, style doesn't cut it for me; I'm looking for subtance, and I found Pony Island lacking in that category.\n\nAnother positive: There was one boss "fight" that I thought was kind of neat, and some of the meta stuff happening there really took me off-guard.  But that's just 10-15 minutes of the game.  I spent the rest in boredom.\n\nLastly, the game is only $5.  This is a plus, because if it looks like the sort of thing that would appeal to you, despite my negative view of it, you're not putting a whole lot on the line to buy it and see for yourself.\n\nIn closing, there's a lot of hype surrounding this game right now, but I don't think that it's warranted.  Pony Island is simply a repetitive game with very little to say.  I think people lauding this game as an early contender for GotY 2016 are gravely mistaken, as I doubt that anyone will remember this game come the end of the year, much less 5 or 10 years from now, when an actual great game's legacy would still be vibrantly alive in its fans' minds.  There's just not anything really memorable or insightful here.\n\nIn short, I don't recommend spending your time on Pony Island.","January 8","false","3.2"," 44 of 92 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","44","92","0","7"

The attempt at horror is just terrible, this game hasn't offered me any of that good old paranoia that a game of it's type promises. The dialogue feels rushed and it leaves no impact on me at all. The hacking bits were nice, but became somewhat boring and it didn't give me the degrees of freedom as I expected it to. The story seemed to have been alterable at first glance, but it's all in a fine line, everything along it, you see coming.

Pony Island was kinda boring. I'm really surprised it'd gotten SO many positive reviews and that makes me feel like i've missed something? I've looked around on the net and watched videos and I didn't see much that I didn't see while I was playing it except a really uninteresting hidden boss at the end.\n\nI honestly try my best to find something likable or at least interesting in any of the media I consume so it took me a while to really formulate an opinion on this one, but after turning it over in my head for a couple days i'm not left with much favorable to say.\n\nRight away the "take something cute but make it all uhh... dark and stuff" theme wasn't too promising, but I saw a lot of potential in the "satanic game" idea and the graphic style gave neat atmosphere that really worked for a while.  I spent the whole game waiting for it to realize this potential into something greater but it never delivered. I guess it's a horror-comedy but it's neither scary nor funny. For as hard as it was trying to be clever, it caught me off guard maybe twice in the two hours it took me to complete it and the entire trajectory of the game felt really obvious. I don't really like games that try to be clever above all else anyway. It make the whole game feel substanceless.\n\nThe thing that bothers me the most tho is that it doesn't even have much in the way of engaging gameplay to fall back on. There's basically two game-types you switch between, one being a really underdeveloped action runner and the other being essentially a pipe puzzle dressed up to look like a coding game. Both get really repetative.\n\nThere's an earlier browser version of this game from 2014 that takes maybe two minutes to play. It's really stripped down compared to this. No real story, no pipe puzzles, none of the clever tricks, none of the wacky dialog, and no pony lasers. What it does provide is an eerie and mysterious atmosphere without anything else to weigh it down. It's not scary or otherwise particularily notable, but it's a charming little game.

The plot is akin to a generic creepy pasta, so it doesn't scratch pretty deep to begin with. Thematically, it just jumps straight into being unsettling, leaving no real surprise when it becomes more and more satanic as the game progresses. The attempts to include biblical references are also pretty sloppy. This may come from the game being unsure if it's supposed to be funny or spooky. The music is pretty good, but equally as repetitive.\n\nAs you can probably assume from the screenshots, the gameplay is rubbish. You jump over hurdles and shoot your lazer. It never really gets difficult in any way, in that you have infinite tries in every single situation, including the final and secret final bosses.\nThe puzzle sections of the game are somewhat interesting in concept, being a sort of sequence puzzle, but it expects the player to be dumb as a stump and never pushes the complexity past a few minutes of trial and error.\n\nIn a game about breaking the 4th wall, it doesn't do enough with that concept. I expected a lot more player interaction but in the end I found the game was just funneling my choices by barring me from siding with the satanic voice comming from inside the game. For example, at one point in the game you are forced to cheat in order to get a lazer beam, but soon after the satan voice tells you to turn off the cheat. I tried to, to see if I could for some extra dialogue and the game had disabled the option to. It's things like this which turn a 4th wall breaking experience into an on the rails no fun allowed snorefest.\nThe only part that actually caught me by surprise was asmodeus making skype sounds and steam notifications pop up. I would love to see more things like that, where the fail state is a little more obscure and open ended than just dieing in a minigame and having to restart.\n\nBasically, don't buy it unless you're a markiplier clone.\n\n1/666","January 12","false","3.2"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

I bought it because it looked like an interesting puzzle solver and had lots of good reviews and although parts of it are good. (The interactive bits between the player and the entities in the machine are quite well done) most of the game involves running the same linear pony run over and over and over which gets tedious. I might even have been able to cope with that but there seems to be a few bugs. One involves sometimes the lazer going off instead of jumping with the left mouse button (I even started using my left and right hand to press the buttons to make sure I wasn't accidently hitting the wrong ones by mistake but no joy there), and the other popped up as sin desert where when you do the large stream of lazer sometimes it takes a second or two after you lift your finger off the button to stop the lazer from working.....by which stage you've died because you were meant to jump. (You don't seem to be able to start a jump with the lazer going). That means you go right back to the beginning and have to run the same linear jump and fire game over and over until you manage to get through despite the glitches. Maybe it's because I'm using a trackpad. I wasn't aware the game said to use a mouse not a trackpad until I'd already bought it and since I don't own a mouse the trackpad's all I've got (Worth bearing in mind if you're a laptop only user like me).

I get it, you're "unique" because you use them, but I don't know why people havent grown tired of pixel graphics just because these game devs are huge hipsters. In games like Undertale, the graphics are reasonable because they have importance in getting the theme across, like when you fight Omega Flowey and the graphics completely change to a wierd google images art style. That change in graphics had a major impact in what the player felt when fighting Omega Flowey. IN THIS GAME THERE IS NO REASON TO HAVE PIXEL GRAPHICS OTHER THAN BECAUSE IT'S A TREND AND WE ALL LOVE A GOOD BANDWAGON. Also, there's a 3D type of effect that really hurts the eyes.\n\nAWFUL IDEAS\nListen, aight?\nI thought this game had real cool ideas.\nSUPER COOL ideas.\n\nAnd then those ideas were scrapped for awful ones that MADE NO SENSE IN THE LEAST BIT.\nHere's an example:\n\nFilthy: So, purgatory is an arcade like video game, where you're trapped inside of it? That's pretty neato.\n\nGame: NOPE PURGATORY IS THE ARCADE ITSELF NOT THE GAME\n\nFilthy: but that's stupid, couldn't you just leave\n\n\nAWFUL EVERYTHING\n\nman i just really wanted to like this game\ni was so hyped for it\n\nit's just an undertale clone\nexcept with satan\nand it sucks\nand it hurts to say that it sucks\nbecause i thought if the ending was better\ni'd really like this game\n\n4/10\n\n","February 1","false","2.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Before I go into a rant, listen, I find the concept and its art design incredibly good, the game messes with you in such a way that you want to keep on playing, it's just a shame that the gameplay itself isnt very good. Pony Island goes into two main forms of gameplay, the infinite pony runner and the code puzzles, sadly both of these will end up wearing on your patience rather quicky as the infinite runner is just that, and the puzzles get frustrating to the point of soaking up most of the adventure without giving you much of a reason to enjoy them. This game is a sponge of repetition, new concepts do not come frequently, and for the most part all they are is just a visual effect with little variation. I can only recommend those who are extremely curious to try the game out, and hey if you find something in the game I didnt?

Pick up this game.  It's short, sweet, and yet, somehow very involved with plenty of secrets.  In the playtime overall listed for me, I have 100% completed this game.  BUY IT!\n\nNow then, on to the main review:\n\nAllow me to be clear, this game is not entirely about ponies.  If you're considering it because ponies, look elsewhere.  If you're looking for a puzzle platformer that messes with your head, you should pick this up.\n\nThe game's story isn't flat out told to you, however there are clues if you know where to look.  You play as Theodore, a crusader who died and was sent to purgatory.  While there, you are forced to play a poorly programmed video game.  You recieve help from a hopeless soul, who is likewise trapped in the computer.  As you play, things deteriorate as you match wits with 1u(c)if#r, the programmer of (the In-Universe) Pony Island, and his 3 daemons (Incedently, I love that pun.  Well played Dan).\n\nThe game centers around 2 main concepts, the puzzles and the platforming.  Each of these is very well put together, and leads to an enjoyable gameplay experience.  The game is best played with a wired 2-3 button mouse, but you can also use Space and Right Alt (Option).  The puzzle difficulty is staggered very nicely and, with one notable exception, make you feel very smart when you solve them. (At least, that's my subjective view)\n\nThe visual style of this game is remenicent of DOS-era PC games, featuring a lot of vector-based artwork.  At least, at first.  One of the greatest things about this game is how it almost perfectly mirrors PC game advances, adding an overworld and eventually full 16-bit color graphics.  The music and sound design is also fantastic.  I purchased this game and the Soundtrack DLC, and both are worth the money.\n\nThis game has 24 tickets to collect and 20 achievements.  Be prepared once you get that 24th ticket though.  Once you do, you get whisked away to the true final boss, unless you are playing through the game for the first time, getting every ticket on the way.  Then you will have to wait until the end of the game.  This boss has 3 phases that reflect what you have learned in the platforming portions of the game.  While I'm talking about bosses, I should bring up the daemons.  The first one tests your puzzle skills.  The second one tests your platforming skills.  The third one messes with your head, and it is glorious.  It even tricked me once, and I knew it was coming!  I love when bosses break the 4th wall creatively, so this boss was a nice treat.\n\nOverall, this game is amazing.  If you need another reason to pick up this game, just look for the 200+ post discussion in the community hub.  Give it a read, and you'll see just how much love went into this game.  This game gets my Seal of Recommendation.  GIVE IT A TRY, MORTAL.","April 4","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After going through all this game has to offer, getting all of its achievements and finding all of its secrets (or so I think), I'm not entirely sure if I have played the game or if the game has played me. Like a freaking fiddle. This game will try its darnedest to surprise you by shifting graphical style, gameplay and even tone constantly. It also contains 4th wall breaking moments that will catch you off-guard unless you tackle the game spoilered about them.\n\nThat said, while it will give you quite a few surprises, its gameplay is not really anything to write home about. It simply does the job. It also has a few frustrating moments. You're gonna need a bit of patience to deal with this game.\n\nThis is not a masterpiece, but it is an entertaining game that will subvert your expectations and train you to keep on the look for surprises and secrets.

It was a very fun, pretty short, and VERY difficult game, that I enjoied playing.\n\nIn Pony Island, the Devil, Lucifer, has trapped your soul in a game he made called Pony Island. With the help of, someone, I don't know his name, you are on a mission to escape. It is a very dark game, I will say that. There are 3 core files you must destroy in order to escape, and each is guarded by a Daemon. The game itself has about two controls: Left click and right click. And, no, I'm not making that up. the game makes you think, and it tricks you. It is also creepy at times, say, when, one of your freinds starts Steam messaging you, but actually isn't.\n\nOverall, it is a good game. I do recommend, and it is one of those cheaper games on Steam. Just, if you are a Christian, I suggest you stay away from this game. No offense.","March 30","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zareliman/recommended/405640/","zareliman","Zareli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zareliman/","33 products in account","A new genre/mechanic has been born since games like Frog Fractions or maybe Candy Box. I'd call it "Evolving Deception Puzzle" (EDP) mechanic and it requires excellent development to really interest someone into what seems to be a broken game at first glance. It's still a new genre and requires adding elements of gameplay that will go against mainstream development, that's why it will be difficult to grasp by high budget studios. That didn't stop Daniel Mullins Games when developing this piece of art (yes I consider videogames an artform) and they executed it very well. The retro-gaming style is always challenging the trend of overwhelming graphics, effects and complexity with smart simplicity and creativity. In this regard Pony Island excels in creativity and it's simple in some aspects while complex in others.\n\nPony Island shows exactly what the genre is about, taking elements from all known gaming mechanichs and arranging them into a way that creates a totally different thing. Certainly not a perfect game in all aspects, in my opinion it could look better and be more pleasant overall to the eye and ear while keeping the grim aspects and that can keep some players away. For me it isn't an issue and I'm glad for that but I reckon this game is not for everyone. Sadly this genre requires some gaming experience (since it mixes mechanics) and willingness to "play along" so I wouldn't suggest it to all my friends but I know there's some of them that will thank me after showing them this excellent game.","March 8","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You're stuck in Pony Island forever. Not on Pony Island. In it.\n\nThat's literally the premise of the game. You're playing a game.... about being stuck in a game. The game made by probably the literal devil or..... something demonish like that.\n\nThe gameplay overall is repetitive. Most gameplay is jumping or doing a little puzzle, that's consistent. At least it lets you get used to it in that sense.\n\nThere are definitely some cool parts. This game has lots of homages to older games and genres, and there are some interesting scenes.\n\nThe plot itself is kind of forced. I really dig the premise, but I feel like it's trying too hard.\n\nPony Island's atmosphere is like if you walk through a front lawn on Halloween. A good scary lawn has some neat, creepy ambient effect, maybe with some music, fog, a few tombstones, and an animatronic or few. Pony Island is like the whole lawn is full of really interesting animatronics, but they're pretty cheesy and constantly moving, and it ruins the mood.\n\nDon't get me wrong -- the implications of much of what happens in the game is really interesting. For instance - and the following isn't a "spoiler" so much as it is something that's better to think about after you finish the game - it's slightly implied that every time you mess up, you die and you continue on as someone else. The game has its own world and lore that's pretty neat.\n\nBut if you're like me and can't stand "edge for the sake of edge," then the spiel gets a bit annoying fast. Especially the main character who guides you through.\n\nNow, I'm not saying this game isn't worth playing for that reason. I definitely think it's worth some time. It tackles gaming in a "metafiction" sense -- that is, addressing itself as a game. The genre has a lot of opportunities for metafiction narrative, and this is one of the better shots at it. But if that's not your thing, then you're going to absolutely loathe it.\n\nOverall, Pony Island keeps you entertained the whole way through, but much like the souls in the machine, you might be just waiting for it all to be over.\n\nIs Pony Island worth it? I mean, why wouldn't you buy a $5 game? It's extremely good for its price tag. It's well-programmed and a fun challenge that'll take you on a journey. I'd say, if you're still interested despite my long rambling, give it a shot.","March 10","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pony Island may share a lot of similar design, but I can assure you there's enough meat here to make the meager $5.00 worth it.\n\nIt's not a brilliant game, but it's clever in it's own ways. One boss easily outshines all the other, with a neat little 4th wall break that legitimately got me. It's a weird little puzzle-em-up with a cool framing device and saying too much more would be spoiling. Don't be afraid to play pony island. It doesn't outstay it's welcome and it doesn't feel cheap. When you finish it, you'll feel pleased.","January 6","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Are all the meta gags groundbreaking for the medium? No - Portal, The Stanley Parable and Undertale all did it better. Still, you'll appreciate the labor of love that went into this project. It's a meta-game about game programming and development. Programmers, chipheads and vaporwave fans alike will appreciate all the subtle nods to Windows 95, Atari, Arcades, Nintendo, Programming, Creepypasta, Terrible Flash Games, and the myriad glitches inherent to all software.\n\nI do have one incredibly autistic nitpick that just bugged me, and that's the game's "zeroes and ones" motif - actual base-2 binary dumps are usually abbreviated as base-16 hexadecimal strings because it's slightly more readable than the raw pulses read by machines. Every Hollywood hacker movie gets it wrong, though.\n\nPony Island is not without much bigger problems, unforunately. The pony-jumping, whether by design or otherwise, wears out its welcome fast after just so many iterations. The two constant games at work here boil down to a flappy bird-esque timed rail jumper, and what can best be described as a programming minigame. None of the programming puzzles will make your head explode or require a particularly trained mind, save for Louie's last "Puzzle Break", which I found to be a massive difficulty spike requiring way too many steps and variables to juggle around - you practically need to draw out each step on graph paper. Maybe it's easier if you're well versed in programming or just have a really good memory, but the sheer difficulty of that last puzzle broke the game's pacing for me. I had to look up the solution on YouTube, and even following a walkthrough required me to write each step down over several grids. There's one last puzzle after that, but it's essentially a breather. Still, after wasting an hour on that last one, I was NOT in the mood for any more programming puzzles. I guess your mileage may vary, but I can't be alone in struggling with that one.\n\nAnother, lesser thing that tripped me up was trying to guess a "Pay Attention and Remember This" riddle on the last Core. I simply was not listening for the solution the guardian gave out earlier, and unfortunately it's given out right before a checkpoint when there's a lot of distractions going on, so I had to look up the solution on YouTube, again. Surely I can't be the only one who was caught off guard? How did this get by playtesters?! I get that it's supposed to test your mental savvy but this kind of 4-hour game really should be completable by the masses without having to break out a strategy guide. It's not a super-hardcore "git gud" game like Fighters, Dark Souls or Dwarf Fortress.\n\nEDIT: Turns out I made an honest-to-god mistake and got too easily distracted. The passphrase actually flashes below him after the checkpoint for a good 3 seconds. It's no less noticable than those "I love Paris in the the spring" mind tricks designed to mildly screw with you. I was just too incompetent to notice before I pulled up a strategy guide. There's no strikeout markup on Steam but consider the above paragraph void.\n\n*** SPOILERS FOLLOW ***\n\nAll gripes aside, the ending was pretty cathartic - it left me satisfied for the evening I invested into it. Although before the final escape, I was still pretty confused if Satan was dead after a previous "Final Fight" following the second core file deletion, or if God was a greater evil than Satan pulling the strings a la Shin Megami Tensei, or if the lost soul was going to betray me, but none of those cliched tinfoil twists I half-expected came to fruition. Satan is the villain through and through.\n\nAs for the tickets, there's a bonus fight at the end for collecting them all. Not much of a "True Ending", just an extra. It's really not worth your time. There's no big replay value here aside from little tidbits. You're better off viewing the bonus stuff you missed on YouTube. Don't let this game's one-trick pony wear itself out and negatively taint your memory of it through even more repetitious search for that last lousy point. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but Pony Island has about as much replay value as The Stanley Parable, which is to say, next to none at all. It seems the developers were aware of this, as they literally tell you to delete the game from your hard drive when it's all over. I won't knock the game for being honest about itself. It's a charming little disposable experience for one or two sittings, well worth its meager asking price - moreso than the vast majority of forgettable Hollywood reboots with much less artistic merit than this game. All in all, Pony Island rises above the Sturgeon's Law tide of trendy 8-bit amateur garbage trying to ape Fez or Undertale (themselves heavily inspired by Super Paper Mario and Earthbound, respectively), without breaking any real ground for the medium.","January 21","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, for Pony Island, this caught my attention after watching the Yogscast do a short episode about it. I was intrigued that some guy decided to make a game titled Pony Island.\n\nBut here's where I went wrong...\n\nPony Island isn't some happy go-lucky game where you control some person riding a pony and frolicking in the wilderness. It's a game where you know that the decisions you make impact you as the player and the character you are mimicking. When it comes to indie games, they love using dark themes because it provides that depth most games don't have. In Pony Island, there is no such thing as a linear story. There is reason behind each statement and it's a psychological thriller. Yes, clicking and shooting lazers is all fun and games, but when you are trying to secure your own freedom from the grasp of a devil like creature (Satan, in this case), you will do anything in your power to be freed from the oppression.\n\nThis is why I'm giving this game a definite 9.5/10. The story, art style, and music mesh really well together and gave me a positive experience despite the fact that some parts are really repetitive. I hope you guys enjoy the game as much as I did because man, this is one of the best games I've played so far that came out this year.\n\nFULL RATING:\nStory: 9.8/10\nGameplay: 9.4/10\nMusic: 9.5/10\nArt: 9.2/10","April 2","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Just play it, I honestly wish I went into this game without hearing anything about it. Despite having watched a small tid-bit playthrough, I was still thoroughly surprised in the end. It is a one-time play thing (okay, maybe a second playthrough) but after that, you've seen it all. But for $5, this game was MINDBLOWING!\n\nGet the game, reserve about 1-2 hours for yourself (that's how long it'll take to beat on average) and just play it. you will love it","March 13","true","7.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a lot of good features, which do make me recommend it, but a lot of features that also fall short.\n\nFirst off, the game has nothing to do with ponies.\n\nPony Island is a glitch-horror game based around a single arcade machine (or computer.) It's a puzzle type game as well, and has a deep internal lore and meaning.\n\nPros\n-Puzzles can be challenging\n-Pretty a-ok music\n-Fun stages\n-A lot of fourth wall breaks\n\nCons\n-2-3 hours long\n-Can be hurtful on the eyes at 1 or 2 times\n-Only a handful of characters, not necissarily a bad thing but I like more than 6 characters in games\n\nStory - 7.5\nPresentation - 9\nOverall - 8.5\n\nOpinion\nPony Island is a well-made and very clever game, with lots of tricks up it's sleeve that'll catch you off guard. A nice lore, but not a great story. A little on the short side of characters. As appealing as it is, it has it's flaws at many points. But I do recommend this to anyone that likes puzzle games or just clever games.","January 10","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
