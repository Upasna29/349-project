The twelve songs seem pretty decent and are in the "Pop" (Popular) realm of music for the most part. The content seems a little sparse to me, but for the price (less than a music CD with 12 songs) it’s at a good price point. I recommend it if this is the type of game you’re looking for! You'll see lots of teddy bears, toy trains, and other "kid" things while you play. Babysitters and busy parents rejoice.\n\nI will say that it still needs some work though. For example, the menu is sometimes too "floaty" when trying to select something on screen with your body. I can be leaning to one side and shaking my hands in one direction and it still may not know which way I'm trying to get the cursor to move. And then sometimes it just seems to work perfectly. Very strange. Luckily, you can use the mouse. This seems like the best option for stage selection.\n\nAnother current flaw (if you are alone) is selecting the next song after you complete one. You may need to move the mouse, but then it recognizes that there is no player there, and pauses the game. You have to then "click" or hand gesture (which is finicky right now for me) to get it to resume. A lot of other games of this genre just have you move into a “pose” projected on the screen to resume. That’s where the developer needs to make an improvement.\n\nIn it's current state, it is an 7.5 out of 10, and a good buy it you are interested in these types of games and have someone to enjoy the game with. Remind the kids that the gestures have to be big for the best reading from the PC camera, and you should have a few hours of enjoyment and mild exercise ready to go.\n\n\nA side note: I tried running this on a 6 year old PC with an Intel Video Card onboard, and it staggerd a bit, but didn't make it unplayable.","August 31, 2014","true","2.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

It's a bit like dancing, its light, its funny, it gets me smiling - and it isn't too long!  Just right as a matter of fact.  I can actually see myself doing this a couple of times a day.\n\nThe only problem is the "Calibration" takes awhile before it does get started.\n\nThank you Extreme Reality and Steam.","November 11, 2014","true","2.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"c'mon .. it's a good gift though?" .. yeah, only if I sent along 5 other games to make up for it\n\nit's worth 2-3€ easily.. but twice as much? .. since it's DLC ...  hmmm.. find out for yourself once it's on sale  - mwahaha","December 27, 2014","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
