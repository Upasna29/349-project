It feels like a game released years ago before downloadable games were popular.  It has poor controls that force you to jump forward regardless of momentum and the hamster always go fast which is annoying when trying to platform. The level design is boring and has lots of things that give points even though it lacks leaderboards. It does have some redeeming qualities like being in 2.5D and having a magnet mode that can be fun. Overall it’s just a lazy indie game with little content, bad controls and boring level design.","January 8, 2014","false","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I could complain about blind jumps or the generally lousy level design, but no, this one just fails at step 1.\n\nDon't buy Bad Hamsters.\n\n(I didn't complete this game - I beat about 8 levels and then I got sick of dying to bad controls and bad level design. There's 25 levels, so if you want to point and go "GAME NOT BEATEN!!!", well, nuts to you.)","June 23, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Those are the only good things about this game. The controls aren't good, theres a timer(I HATE timers) and the controls are frustrating. If the game responded better the timer would not be that big of a deal, but you get stuck on nothing and lose seconds before you get unstuck. I got the game in a bundle, don't buy it unless you can get it cheap! 1/10","May 16, 2014","false","0.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Probably untested level design.  My son played it for a half hour and couldn't make it past the 3rd or 4th jump.  As a comparison he is able to beat most levels on "New Super Mario Bros Wii" if given a reasonable amount of time.\n\nThe gamepad support was terrible!  To jump required moving the left joystick down.  Down?  It's weird enough that you have to use the joystick to jump instead of a button.... but how is pressing down an intuitive way to jump?  The ability to switch to magnet mode wasn't even bound to a gamepad button at all.\n\nLast but not least, the annoying music and sound effects are louder than your average game, so you'll have to adjust the sound in order to feel comfortable with the volume.\n\nSo... don't buy this...  I'd almost say it's ok to get if it's free (because some people love anthropomorphized animals), but no guarantees.","September 14, 2013","false","0.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But THIS...???\nWhy did the Hamster get such a wheel instead of something more precisely steerable ...like a shopping cart? You dont even know in wich direction it will jump from the stand or when it wil roll or stop instantly.\n\nGreat example of the "we pimp everything with cheap graphix but in 3D"-Area!\nJust because i didnt have to pay for something, it doesn't mean i cant be disappointed.","July 27, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In order to complete a level you need to go left or right and  jump on all kinds of platforms. To make it a little more interesting, the wheel also has the ability to magnetise itself on the platforms. During all the jumping there are all sorts of enemies/robots and other contraptions you need to avoid. The gameplay is pretty frustrating and the graphics are not great. The game is pretty original but personally I did not think it was fun enough to keep playing.","November 25, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is one of the worst games I've ever played because the controls are so counter-intuitive. Holding mouse 1 and 2 make you move left and right. You can also use arrow keys on the keyboard. I haven't used arrows keys on the keyboard for a game since I played PC games in 1997-1999. How do you jump? Not spacebar like in 99% of games ever made. You can jump by pressing, and get this, either the up arrow or click both mouse buttos at the same time. Everything is so counter-intuitive that it made playng the game a chore and the game is not any good anyway.","April 27, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"
