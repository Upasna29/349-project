I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nObliteracers can be classified as a racing title however it is more of a chaotic free-for-all than anything else. You get to choose from a selection of 16 racers in local or online modes and are limited to the character Sarge in the single player career mode. This is chaotic as you can play modes where you try to barely survive, kill everyone else or stay in front and let your ignorant competitors give you points by destroying each other. Obliteracers also has something which is absolutely amazing and that is 16 player local games. You can connect through gamepads, laptops and smart devices using them as controllers. If you die do not worry you can still lock on and fire rockets to help people or get revenge against the one person who dared go against you, then realize that next round he only wants to kill you and no longer cares about winning. You can also create games from a selection of 33 modifier, 3 presets for mixtures of modifiers, 3 saveable mixtures and 12 maps. Obliteracers is easy to pick up and play and even has a drop in and drop out feature, it’s easy to grasp and fun to master. It even has a preset if you are playing with friends who are new to the game to give losing players bonuses. Overall a great game to play with friends for sure and seems to hold a mixture of Wrecked Revenge Revisited and Mario Kart to create a fun and destructive game.\n\nGraphics\nI am a fan of Mario Kart and this games graphics remind me of it as they are cute, innocent,and colorful. That is until you collect your first weapon powerup and it becomes a deathmatch. The music is innocent and upbeat to help keep you in the mindset to have fun.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ 16 local player games\n+ Game involvement even after death\n+ Fast-paced and quick rounds\n+ Easy to learn\n+ Great amount of replayability\n+ Modifiers\n\nCons\n\n- Small amount of players online currently\n- Easy to get eliminated at the beginning (as much fun as it is to use rockets it’s also fun to race)\n\nSuggestions\nHere are some suggestions I feel would improve the game\n\n- More racers\n- More maps\n- New methods to attack racers after death\n\nFinal Thoughts\nObliteracers is a great party game and I cannot wait to try it the next time me and my buddies hang out (there is usually around 8-12 of us so great to have up to 16 in the local game!).  I was always a fan of Mario Kart but this is Mario Kart subtract the laps and add the battle mode into the racers. It is a mix of Mario Kart and Wrecked Revenge Revisited done amazingly well. Combining the best elements of both games to create a great party game to play and enjoy with friends or even play alone.\n\nTL;DR\nObliteracers is a great party game and has up to 16 player local games. Mix some great elements on Mario Kart and Wrecked Revenge Revisited to be awarded with Obliteracers. Overall easy to pick up and has a great amount of replayability especially with 33 game modifiers.\n\n** Key was provided by developer for review purposes **\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 29","true","12.6"," 52 of 57 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","52","57","3","5"

You will be cursing out random cartoon drivers none stop.\n\nThis isn't a traditional racer, or much a racer at all to be honest. If you want Kart action this isn't your game, I repeat there is very little actual racing. What this is a FFA murderfest though that has driving as the medium. It's generally played as Deathmatch or Last Man Standing, where you keep respawning, you get kills/points by destroying and knocking people off the map or lasting the longest, there isn't a difference other than looks in the Racers, everybody goes the same speed turns the same etc etc.\n\nIf you want a game you can turn on and blow some steam this is great, I cant speak for how well the local multiplayer works, but I was playing with about 10 people online an hour after the launch, depsite having racers from Russia, Britain, Canada, Germany(host) and the USA, it was still respectably playable with 100-200 ping. Did I slide off the course a few times because of the lag the odd time? Yes. You forget about it 20 seconds later because another round starts and the game is just awesome.","February 24","true","4.8"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","49","59","3","0"

Similarly to Speedrunners, if you fall out of the screen border, you die. However, you can also be killed by weaponry.\nThere are multiple weapons that allow for strategic play. Mines, slippery liquid, homing missiles and fire out of your sides.\n\nYou have the ability to bring up a shield at any time, that will negate any damage you take, but slow you down while you use it. You also have the option to hold up your shield as you drive into a weapon pickup, which will heal you, but in turn destroy the weapon. It's a nice trade-situation that allows you to choose.\n\nMy favourite game-modes are the ones where you don't respawn until the next round. This means the race gets more intense as you play. When you are dead, you have the option to skip to the next round if only bots are in play, or aim a crosshair and shoot at any racers you want. This allows you to kill someone who is doing better, to even the playing-field. The interesting thing is, if multiple players are dead, you all control the SAME crosshair. So you're all battling over who to kill, it's quite hilarious.\n\nI should mention how great the multiplayer is by the way. You can play up to 16 players. Bots or humans. With a keyboard, controller or even a smartphone. The system to drop in a new player is quite seamless, and even allows for local & online play at the same time.\n\nThere's a career mode if you want to play through something alone, although there isn't really anything that interesting to it in my opinion. It's the same as versus mode but with a bit of funny text at the beginning, and it cycles through maps and game modes.\n\nSomething pretty fun is you can activate modifiers for races, which keeps things interesting like  doing reversed controls, or the people losing are a bit faster.\n\nOverall, it's a fun racing game with a very nice art style. I love the characters, the world and the gameplay is quite a blast if you have some people to play with!","February 24","true","6.7"," 35 of 42 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","35","42","0","0"

The community I played with on launch day were great, applauding rivals wins and laughing at the chaotic carnage (but please if you are playing with a mic, use headphones to cut out the feedback, we thank you). ;)\n\nAnd the game modifiers, wow, so many options. Try the combination of, no pickups, drift gift, pinball, ice skating and the floor is lava on Survival, most insane fun I've had in ages.\n\nIf you are looking for a party, or a kart style game, you should get this one, I highly doubt anyone would regret dropping the asking price (less than $20 aussie dollars) on this excellent game. This will be the game I gift to friends for their birthdays this year (if you are my friend, forget you just read that).\n\nWould (and will) obliterate cute alien racers again. 10/10","February 24","true","90.3"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","29","35","0","0"

There are plenty of game modes, but most of them split races on rounds in which 60-80% of players die in first 4 seconds.\n\n"So play in another modes" - you would say, but here is another problem. On a third day after release there are less than\n10 people in online. There is literally nothing to play. (not game's fault, but its a multiplayer title so you get the point),\n\nLack of content. The soundtrack is enjoyable at first and annoying after 20 mins of game session. There are only 4 racers (with some recolors, so they say "16") to chose. Maps look different artistically, but the tracks feel the same.\n\nAnd at last - the controls, I've played on 360 controller and its pretty personal opinion, but it's not that fun to play it. They just don't feel smooth and then you add a mess, which usually happens at races this problem becomes really frustrating.\n\nThe only way I see that game being worth a purchase - to serve an option to play when you have a party at home.\n","February 26","false","4.4"," 36 of 54 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","36","54","0","1"

Don't rely on them very much. Very difficult to control this way, although a nice idea, and players with real controllers will have a clear advantage.\n\nPROs\n- Great graphics, weather effects, and level design.\n- Jazzy soundtrack, old grumpy racers... just need a cane!\n- 16 player versus and a great single player campaign\n\nCONs\n- Mobile controls need work, very hard to play this way\n- AI is not challenging in small groups.\n- Get lost in the crowd super easy.","March 15","true","5.1"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

I have three controllers and a couple of roommates and they all love this game! The maps are fun, characters are cool and the weapons are pretty diverse. Best of all, max 16 players! Add tons of bots on easy mode for maximum mayhem.\n\nThe thing I don't like is the amount of maps, there are only a couple that are not totally slippery. (4 maps in 3 different weather modes each, but we pretty much only like the non-wet modes). Story is pretty barebones too but if you play this as a purely party game like we do it doesn't matter. So if you buy it for solo play you probably will be disappointed, and not too many people online either. The local multiplayer is its best feature.\n\nThere are other games with friends, like Speedrunners, and I like Sonic ASRT for karting, and Obliterators is a mix of the two.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/recommended/368740/","MeltingComet","龍 Rip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingComet/","329 products in account","I got a key from the developer for the review. It doesn't change my opinion in any bit whatsoever.\nPure Chaos\n\nObliteracers is a deceptively fun concept that runs on the novel connectivity and accessible of 16 player local-multiplayer. Rather then racing to the end of the goal, it's all about destroying your opponents in absolute chaos.\n\nPros:The game's technology works. I was instantly able to connect my phone to the game and it was very responsive.\nThe game's artstyle and graphical fidelity is decent, but can surprisingly handle itself on lesser hardware as well. Optimization is not too perfect, but it's fairly good, and fairly playable.\nDespite being chaotic and often being busy with a ton of players, the game's added shield mechanic prevents the game from simply encouraging players to throw items everywhere.\nThe maps may seem less interesting and more repetitive in terms of design, but it works here mainly because of the action in the maps.\nA lot of ways to modify multiplayer games, and many ways for people to play!\nHighly polished and playable. It's a good thing they didn't release this during Early Access.\nNitpicks:Jazzy and entertaining music, but is looped way too much, making it sound incredibly grating at times\nControlling the game with a mobile device is incredibly hard, and that's because of it's steering controls. It will take awhile to get used to, and the developers told me that it's best if you practiced the control-type with a regular controller or in a more isolated situation first.\nCareer Mode isn't too interesting in particular, and is generally not that long to play through either. Those playing alone may find this in particular very worrying.\nThe original keyboard control scheme is uncomfortable to play with.\nCons:Very little character variety. 16 characters, most of them being based off of the 4 main racers of the game. It doesn't matter to say the least, but I would had liked to see a lot more variety then 4 separate versions of Sarge.\nContent in general is a lot smaller then I hoped for, but it's still a alright price tag for its' multiplayer experience.\nThe lack of players for it's online component really worries me. The game needs to find some way to gain traction or you can forget ever playing a full lobby online.\nFIRST IMPRESSIONS REVIEW:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630756618\n\nObliteracers is absolutely fun. Playing with friends has been an enjoyable romp and even it's lackluster Career Mode holds up better thanks to the game's insane and chaotic nature being both easy to understand and fun! It's polished and immensely playable, and this is backed up by how accessible it also is.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630756606\n\nThe game's main hook is that up to 16 people can play at once. Have a phone, or a laptop, or a controller? Whip it out, and you can join in on the action very easily. It's simple, and it's responsive too. Although steering with a mobile device ended up being a disaster, it was otherwise surprisingly responsive. No input lag was experienced whatsoever connecting it with other devices.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630756590\n\nUnfortunately, it's single-player side is a bit light, which is fine, but because Obliteracers' servers are going to be peer-to-peer versus being dedicated, the online is going to majorly rely on the amount of people playing. It's career mode is just a bunch of set-up matches and isn't particularly too interesting, or even remotely that large of a challenge. Solo players may be turned off by this, but for those who have a ton of friends/family members to play with, it's the perfect couch game to play.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=630756564\n\nThe amount of game-modes, maps, and characters aren't substantial or large, so I'm hoping the developers will continue adding more content as time comes by. The game modes are fun though, although most of them deviate from the main formula of "kill everybody".\n\nOn the bright side, it's mutators keep the matches much more interesting; stuff like "Staying on the floor will kill you" and "Everybody bounces around like a literal pinball" shake a lot of races up, reinventing how to play. I think these mutators are going to really make matches\n\nPresentation-wise, it's decent. It's soundtrack is great to jam out too (if it wasn't constantly looped over and over), it's visuals look nice, and the UI doesn't interfere with the game. The menus are fairly basic but get the job done.\n\nThe controls may take some getting used to in general, but one notable issue I have is sometimes it wouldn't respond when I started the race accelerating. It's happened multiple times while playing with a phone, controller, and keyboard.\n\nThe combat emphasis on the game isn't just a chaotic mess either. You can put up a shield to keep you invulnerable from attacks but you won't be able to accelerate (And the weapon you're holding will drop). It's a cool mechanism that places a risk in the game; Do you want to try and keep the weapon, and attempt a counter attack? Or do you want to drop the item and shield yourself to prevent total devastation? It makes the game much more interesting then "SPAM ITEMS EVERYWHERE!!!".\n\nThe online unfortunately is not that populated. Sometimes, you can find a large game of at least 7 people. Other times, it's as empty as it was before the game came out. It's sorta disappointing that the game didn't gain enough traction, since not everybody is going to be able to invite their friends over all of the time.\n\nTL;DROverall, Obliteracers is a great game! It's stuck with a few flaws, some weird optimization/control glitches, and a already dead online, but it's a game that's so damn fun and absolutely chaotic.\n\nFINAL REVIEW: Definitely Recommend; Players playing the single-player/online should wait for a sale, anyone who likes party games should pick it up now!\nFor more reviews on all sorts of games, follow  Lots' o Giveaway's group curations and reviews  here!","February 23","true","5.1"," 36 of 64 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","36","64","3","0"

This amazing Kart racing, Obliterating, Insane Racing game is as i said AMAZING!\nThe game is not just a really nice to pick up and play when you wanna burn some time, you easily get into the game and have really fun (while swearing alot) with your friends or other players trying to kill as many of them as possible. The artstyle is cute, cartoonish and just right for this kind of game. The soundtrack is really good, making the game even better.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the controls are both good and easy too use, personally i recommend using a controller but with alot of friends you will have to get used to the smartphone controls (they can be a little clunky in the beginning). The game modes are all fun and different, there is easily a game mode for all of us in there. The maps are beautiful and cool and the way of making some harder by adding different weather conditions was really cool and immersive. The multiplayer was also really fun, never had any issues connecting to other people and rarely lagged when playing on other peoples matches.\n\nOverall i would give this game a (9/10), i can really see the potensial in having alot of fun with friends and playing for many hours straight, the artstyle and soundtrack is really good and it just helps the game shine even more. The game also runs really well and is easily played without any problems. For this price i would really recommend the game for everyone who likes these kind of games, heck even the people who dont like the Kart racing type of games migth enjoy this!\n\nGraphics (9/10)\nGameplay (10/10)\nSoundtrack (9/10)\nReplayability (7/10) with friends (10/10)","February 29","true","12.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The aim of the game isn't to race, its to obliterate (duh, title) the other racers (however, you can get far enough ahead of other players that they disappear of the screen, which kills them). This seems to be one of the biggest complaints about the game, and if people spend 1 minute reading the description they would understand what the game is about.\n\nDepending on which game mode you play, you get points for killing other players, either by using powerups or knocking them off the racetrack. There's also an elimination-type gamemode where you get points for being the last one alive in a round. Powerups are fairly common throughout the racetrack, and the players can shield their car from attacks from powerups, though this will drop or deactivate any powerup they currently have.\n\nVery fun and zany game, and could be great at LAN parties, as you can connect to the game using your smart phone/tablet and use it as a controller.","February 29","true","1.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's a Mario Kart/Bombsquad matchup. There's not really any actual racing really so much as a vehicular assault game. Basically, this game takes the game modes from arena pvp games (deathmatch, survival, etc) and puts them on a track. The controls are super tight. Everything works as it should. The only caviat to this is the phone controls, which DO work really well, but the inherent flaws of working on a touch screen really show themselves here. With no tangible feedback or physical buttons to reference, you will be looking at your phone as often as you will at the game.\n\nWith half a dozen courses and several varients there's enough track variety to do the job. There's a really good variety of weapons that all feel unique and valid in certain scenarios. A couple might be OP (oil slick) but overall it's a good showing.\n\nIf you are a fan of local PvP/party games, this one is a must have.","February 28","true","14.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It features local and online party play, not splitscreen, but the camera expanding to support everyone. It brings back the nostalgic mario-kart feelings to 2016, and multiplies the fun by 4x, quite literally. Even more interesting (the first game I've seen to do this), you can hook up extra controllers, laptops and smartphones/tablets to get the whole family involved.\n\nObliteracers also uses local area network forwarding, which means the smartphone control goes straight to your modem and straight back to your PC. However, the smartphone/tablet controls I feel are a little dodgy and need to be changed to a more simple, 1 joystick style instead of this smart accelerator stuff they've got going at the moment.\n\nIf you have no friends or your family is deciding to anti-social, the AI is there and good to go. The AI isn't dumb, but sure as hell be a lot better. They tend to not use the power-ups very effectively and make some decisions that isn't exactly clever.\n\nThe UI is perfect, it is 100% compatible with controllers so you can hook your laptop up to the TV and be all good to go! However, I feel the kart number system is a little confusing at times and lets just say the 16-player online gets really confusing, fun and absolutely MENTAL when you join a full match.\n\nTo summarise (and some other stuff I'm too lazy to say):\n\nPros:\nUnique controller system\nInsane 16 player party gaming fun\nSeamless UI\nVariety of maps\nTons of gamemodes\nThat awesome Unreal Engine 4 feel\nAwesome online multiplayer\nNo splitscreen, just a single screen for everyone!\nHumorous and quick music (I know, it sounds weird but it is)\n\nCons:\nFew servers hosted, said servers not often full\nSlightly repetitive career mode\nNot as many power-ups as I would like\n\n8/10 from me, great buy :)\n\n\n","February 26","true","2.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I hope they fix it in soon.","February 27","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Controls are a bit slidey but it adds to the chaos of the races.\n\nGraphics are decent enough but it can be hard to see your character with the zoomed out camera.\n\nCommunity is good and the games are fun. More like Micro Machines than Mario Kart.\n\n","February 24","true","7.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Would like a little more GP stype but I havn't played much so far.  Maybe there will be some gameplay more like that.

I failed to do the research before buying and was displeased by the camera view in game play.I also disliked the controls. I felt like I had little to no control over my character at times.
