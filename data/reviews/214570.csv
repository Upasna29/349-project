Unlike many other shooters, Ether Vapor switches between several different perspectives. There are no power ups. Your ship is equipped with three primary weapons at start, each of them is good for different occasion. While there are only perhaps a dozen different enemy models, some effort has been put into unique enemy designs. Lets talk about Explosions, they look very nice and the curving homing lasers that many ships in the game fire are worth see. There has been a lot of attention to detail. Enemies produce vapor trails and bullets release a shower of particles when hitting target. There is lot of going on and many boss fights included too. Quick view on the controls in the menu, yes it's terrible but you get used to it. The game was originally released only through Japanese doujin channels in 2007 and it was released again in 2011 as remaster version. Ether Vapor is a solid shooter with a lot going for it. Its production values are really high compared to a lot of doujin products. Perspective-changing levels provide a welcome change to the normal shooter genre.","March 5, 2015","true","1.4"," 61 of 75 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","61","75","5","0"

Somewhat reminiscent of mid to late 90ies 3D shmups (particularly the Taito-stuff like the Layer/Ray-games and maybe a bit of the Donpachi thrown in for good measure). Ether Vapor is a hybrid of classic shmup-styles with more modern score-focused elements added in. Meaning that bulletpatterns aren't exactly "danmaku" or bullet-hell and your ships hitbox is pretty big. Nevertheless stuff gets pretty intense and particularly the final bosses flood the screen with projectiles leaving little space to dodge away and get out of the line of fire.\n\nAs far as score-focused elements go, you will only be rewarded with a high-score if you 1CC a stage all the way through to the end. Dying in a bossbattle means all your victory-points are lost to the void, same goes for your timebonus for beating a boss really fast. Compared to more modern / recent STG-titles, score and "normal" gameplay aren't all that interlocking - so you can play this just for the sake of completing it and never give a damn about score.\n\nIn order to do so, you keep playing again and again, unlocking extrashields and credits - making the game progressively easier as you go on. But 1CCing is pretty much the way to go, and here start the problems. While the game is really nice to look at - with very fun, classic designs and textures that remind me of the way one would color and shade Gunpla/Robot-Modelkits (which is a nice touch) as well as fantastic looking explosions - it is unfortunately way too easy to loose track of enemy projectiles and/or your ship as soon as the game really starts throwing stuff at you. To make matters worse, at times the perspective shifts into a weird third person view/dynamic angle in which I still haven't figured out where the hell in space I am actually am - as a result I constantly take "this is bull"-hits in these sequences. It can be frustrating to say the least, and is definitely a real problem that could break the experience for you especially if you go for that perfect run.\n\nHowever, the rest is so fast and fun, particularly blowing up whole squadrons of popcorn-enemies feels so damn good thanks to excellent feedback and massive explosions that I can look past some of the design flaws. Overall, the quality of the game is pretty fantastic - especially if you consider that this is a japanese doujin-game and not a big company retail title developed for the arcades or something. I wished other indie-titles were this solid at the core.\n\nEther Vapor Remaster simply nails that arcade-feeling I am looking for, and while flawed in parts, is pretty much without competetion on Steam right now (thanks to Greenlight that will change soon) at what it does. So, grab it if you have that arcade-itch.","January 25, 2014","true","3.9"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

(Who the hell thought this was a good idea is beyond me) The first two weapons cover front and side directions while the last is an auto locking missile launcher which is something more bullet hell games need since now you can focus on dodging. The overall gameplay is cinematic in a genre that only focuses on doing one thing in one direction. So far there is no other game that pulls in off available making this a must buy for bullet hell fans.","April 28, 2014","true","3.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

A neat 2.5D doujin shmup that mostly plays in a vertical fashion, but will occassionally switch perspective to horizontal, and even through gameplay moments simlar to Starfox 64 and Rez, using it's 3D capabilities to it's advantage. You can get a better feel of bullet mechanics thanks to the hitbox option. It's great to let you know where you can be hit and where to hit enemies, but it's a bit wonky because the red, circular hitbox overlays are on the upper most layer, so it will be above damn near everything, including cutscene tech. It's worse when there are so many hitboxes on bots - anything with collison has hitboxes, including you and your own damn bullets, so you will see red circles all over the damn screen. Whats worse, a blue hitbox typically means it's a defeated enemy that is exploding into the background, but the hitboxes for actual enemies in the background are still red, so you can't quite tell if something is in the foreground or background until you shoot it. I think it's a better job than Sine Mora IMO, but all you have to go by is depth. Which brings me to the biggest issue of the game, and that is being able to tell what is in the background. You might find yourself dying a bit to enemies shifting to the foreground, and dodging bullets in the background that aren't actually going to hit you yet. Otherwise, the difficulty is is fair and mostly "your fault if you die". It's a pure shmup in a sense, so it isn't a bullet hell, but it can almost get there. You don't have powerups, but you rely on a forward gatling gun that can charge a penetrative blast , a laser missle lock on a la Zone of the Enders, and a wide shot that can be charged to release a bullet cancelling bomb, which is great for personal defense and doesn't damage you, but doesn't protect you from collision damage. Soundtrack is good, but nothing award winning. If you're big into shmups, I can recommend it, thought you may want to watch some videos to see if the 3d aspect will bother you.","August 28, 2013","true","1.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Each weapon also has a charge part to it.  Making the weapon system a bit like a combination of R-type and Radiant Silvergun.  The unlockable ships all have variations on the same weapon types but still manage to be useful.  Movement feels great and bullets are abundant enough that you feel there's enough going on without being too overwelmed.  In this regard the game isn't really considered a Bullet hell.\n\nBAD\n\nUnfortunately there are quite a few problems with the game as a whole.  The scoring system is something that I think could have used some more work to make it more interesting for Super plays.  And another problem is the graphics... No.  The quality isn't bad.  The issue stems from identifying bullets admist the chaos and knowing what can and can't hurt you.  In most SHMUPs enemy bullets are on the highest layer and are typically a bright colour that you can identify easier.  Some bullets that aren't of the pink ball variety tends to blend in with the explosions and your own bullets.  Leading to moments where you question what just hit you.  The story is there but nothing too special.  I watched the cutscenes once then turned them off personally.","August 7, 2014","true","6.2"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The small production cost and team show through in some rough edges but what it gets right it gets REALLY right.\n\nThe bad first. It has a hitbox that can’t decide what size it wants to be, some bullets have larger areas of effect than it shows, the 3D view means that shots can come from a different plane than you’re on and they can be very difficult to judge (particularly homing shots), and the game has an uneven difficulty shifting between painfully simple and blazingly difficult at times.\n\nBut its high points drown those low ones out quite handily. A very pretty aesthetic, an interesting (if underdeveloped) story which is exceedingly rare in this genre, good music, and extensive replayability via a host of unlockables.\n\nIt’s also easily accessible for players of all skill levels; I definitely think this will be my first recommendation to those new to the genre from now on. While other games might have tighter gameplay the fact that you can customize your game via additional credits and shields (unlocked through reaching certain scores, or beating the game) that mean anyone can beat the game through virtually unlimited continues making it perfect for introductory level players. Even for those of us who know the genre this is still a nice addition because it makes learning the later levels much easier since you aren’t immediately booted after making one slip-up as you are in other games. Allowing you to play through the hard parts to see and memorize all the patterns before coming back and beating it the “right” way.\n\nIn short it’s a great game despite a few missteps, and might well be the perfect game for those just coming to the genre that find some of the hardcore Shmups on Steam just a little too hardcore.","April 25, 2014","true","8.7"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The stages blend horizontal- and vertical-scrolling sections with some more novel perspectives, allowed by the 3D graphics engine, but the player's ship still moves only in a 2D plane.\n\nAlthough the gameplay itself works fine enough, the graphics prove to be a problem in enjoying the game. One, some enemy bullet types are far too unnoticeable. Two, the graphics (and sound) do not properly convey the "oomph" the player's ship is supposed to have - it feels like a paper airplane with a peashooter for a gun. In this respect, though, it's way better than Razor 2.\n\nIt's possible that I've missed something, but it also doesn't make a good score attack game, as the scoring is notably simple and bland. There aren't chain multipliers, for instance. Some bigger enemy ships can be shot for a period of time after they're "incapacitated" before they explode to earn extra points, but that's about it, beyond bonus sections and points earned for time remaining at the end of the game.\n\nIn the end, the game does not do enough to make it stand out of the crowd.

Do you like StarFox? if so then this game is just for you! Like Life Force, Ether Vapor is a fast-paced shmup that changes perspectives throughout. Blast enemies in stages that change from horizontal to vertical between each stage; the stages will even do a 3D over-the-shoulder view that either sends you in a lock-on assault minigame or starfox-like railshooting segments seemlessly. The game does the transitions smoothly, and gives the game a cinematic feel (particularly during stage 4's airship raid.)\n\nInstead of powerups, you have three weapons with two of them having alternate functions. In order to master this game, you will have to learn to know which weapons to use when. Of course we have the standard forward shot, but make sure to use the wide shot to attack enemies from the side, and get ready to put up the forcefield when things get too hot. are enemies attacking from behind, or are they assaulting you in the background? lock on to them and attack with powerful homing lasers!\n\nIf you worry about the game being to hard, it's actually one of the more forgiving shmups, and even when you get a game over the game will unlock the option to use more lives and credits, so you can keep going on until you're able to beat it, and even then after you beat the game you can customise the options to give yourself a challenge or make thing easier. There's also plenty of unlockables  such as extra playable ships as well\n\nAlso, keep in mind that Remaster mode lacks cutscenes and text for those who would perfer a more arcade-like experience free of abundant text, while Original mode contains all the story and character dialog for those who would like more exposition in their shooters.\n\nOverall, I can say I reccomend this game.","December 2, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/recommended/214570/","maderschramm","Shotime","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maderschramm/","1157 products in account","Ether Vapor: Remaster is an arcade shooter that focuses on being cinematic and challenging.  As shooters go, it's pretty difficult (your hitbox is quite large); although, some of this difficulty can be of the unnatural variety.  For example, a lot of the colors for projectiles run together.  It's extremely difficult to avoid a projectile if it is the same color as the weapons you fire, or is blocked out by your own laser beams.  To partially rectify this, the game allows you to turn on "hitboxes", which is nice in theory, but it adds hitboxes to *everything* in the game, including your weaponry and your enemies weaponry.  This helps to allow you to see what's shot at you for *some* projectiles; however, it also clutters up the screen and everything has a red border, so it blocks out other projectiles that weren't very hard to see before.  It's a rock and a hard place, and it's really a shame because it's a major strike against a shmup.  In trying to be cinematic and not make every projectile pink (the best color to use in shmup IMO) they've added an unfair difficulty spike to it.  But, the game is mostly good, hence the recommendation I'm offering for it.  There are two ships to select from (one is unlocked after the game) and you have three modes of firing - Frontal, Side, and Homing - nothing surprising there; however, you can also charge up the weapons for a massive piercing frontal attack, a shield that damages everything caught in it and blocks projectiles and lasers (extremely handy) and a massive AOE homing explosion attack.  Homing attacks are very important in this game.  A unique mechanic of Ether Vapor is that the game is semi-3d, I think it's officially classified as 2.75D.  The perspective changes from top-down, to left-to-right, to even behind the ship (think Star Fox).  It's really neat and is done well, flowing into and out of combat.  There are also really neat periods of time where you use the ships homing lasers to destroy missiles while autopilot is on and you rack up huge points - extremely fun!  That said, another strike against this game is that the Z axis is played with a lot, and it's nigh impossible to determine if enemies are able to be hit by conventional weaponry or if you need to use the homing lock on because they're off your Z-plane.  It can get annoying and the only way to know for sure is experience in the game.  Speaking of experience, this game teaches you how to play it pretty well.  It seems extremely unforgiving as you need to start over every time you play, but in reality you get better, learn the levels, and you unlock more continues and more "shields" (hits you take before you need to continue again) as you play.  So it eases you into the game and it makes what at first seems daunting and impossible easier as time goes on.  I felt it was paced really well and still kept its arcade roots, unlike other shmups like Sine Mora.  After beating the game, besides the new ship you also unlock Boss Rush mode that adds replayability.  You also unlock "extras", which is really just a link to a Japanese-only website, so that's kin of a bummer.  The switching of weapons and arcadey style is really reminiscent of Ikaruga, and if you enjoyed that game you'll probably like this one.\n\nPros:\n\nCinematic\nFun\nVaried/Useful weaponry\nPacing\nChallenging\n\n\nCons:\n\n"Cluttery"\nZ-Axis woes\nLack of leaderboards (and personal ones don't work quite to my satisfaction either)\n\nAll in all this is a difficult shooter that has a lot of fun and fast paced action.  Even a veteran will find himself challenged by this game and new players can get eased in and earn more continues but still feel like a bad ♥♥♥ since there is only one difficulty level.  There's a story as well, but like most Japanese shooters it's not much of note.  I'd buy this if you like shooters, but note it's not the best one I've played.

Its level pacing is tense,fast-paced, with few, but very much appreciated, bonus modes in the middle of the levels to give you a brief respite from the frantic action. The game switches between different perspective approaches depending on area, giving you more than one style of play to keep things interesting, including side scrolling, top-down, and the thankfully brief "over the shoulder" forward-facing views. The challenge of the levels scales fairly fast, with the all too easy first level and its way too easy boss, the second with slightly more compentent enemies and a more challenging boss, and with the third level , things start to get progressively more insane, As you play the game, you unlock more continues and more shield points to take you further into the game.\n\nAfter about 8 hours of repeat playing to get a full initial shield bar I beat the final boss. so the game is kinda short, possibly shorter for players more familiar with the genre, but does offer decent replay value in the form of online score boards and unlocks, This game might not seem as good a value in gameplay hours as some other games, but definitely worth buying anyway with how fun and challenging it is.

It is hard to believe this is actually a remaster of something.\n\nTo start, the game often fails to initialize. If the game starts, but nothing happens, use keys Z, X, C and V to see if something will happen. The default key settings are completely unusual: the [Z] key is actually <Enter>.\n\nThe gameplay is awful: most of the bosses are quite unfair and if you don't end up with an epileptic seizure, you'll end up dying before the 3rd or 4th screen.\n\nThat is also all there is to it: a few very generic screens with enemis coming is increasing quantity and difficulty.\n\nI don't recommend getting this game even if it was free. It is a total waste of time. If it weren't for the free card drops, I wouldn't even install this POS. As soon as the last card drops, I'll uninstall this POS.","May 21, 2014","false","1.1"," 3 of 17 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","3","17","0","0"

Weapons and Upgrades: First and foremost, there are no upgrades here and you only have one ship. That being said, the ship has 3 modes (Normal, Overdrive and Extra) and every mode has it's own set of 3 more or in some cases less similar weapons. This is NOT the type of game where you just take the best weapon you can find and hold down the button. Let's explain the main weapons of the normal mode, once you get the hang of them you can figure out the other modes yourself.\n-Primary Fire - keep pressing the primary button: Deals fast and high damage in a straight arc, good for bosses and bigger enemies\n-Primary Fire Alternative - Hold Button to load, release button when charged to fire: This fires an piercing shot that deals 500 damage to everything in it's path, it's sometimes useful against bosses but you will mostly want to use this against many enemies, especially when the important enemies are obstructed by armor or other enemies\n-Secondary Fire - keep pressing the secondary button: This mode is simlar to the primary fire mode but it puts your weapons at an angle to cover the screen, it is also weaker than the primary mode, obviously used to dispatch small fry\n-Secondary Fire Alternative -  Hold Button to load, release button when charged to fire: This creates a field that negates bullets immediately and cuts off any beams, it also deals moderate damage to enemies, you will in some cases need this to avoid being hit and there are a few places where this shield can also be used offensively\n-Tertiary Fire - Hold Button to unleash a constant stream of homing missiles: This fires a constant stream of missiles after locking on to an enemy, deals a little less damage than the primary mode\n-Tertiary Fire Alternative - While the weapon is active and an enemy is locked on to, press nothing to load and press tertiary fire to unleash: This fires a barrage of missiles which create an AoE damage effect, this is useful and almost necessary in some places to dispatch certain groups of enemies fast\n\nAs I said, it's not about using the strongest weapon, it's about using the right weapon at the right time.\nAs a rule of thumb, it's possible to destroy everything that ever enters the screen, if you're not even getting close it means you're not using your arsenal right. There are only very few expections to this, one for example being the scene in the city where you can either destroy the laser cannons or the ship in the background, but there you won't be able to destroy everything.\n\n2. Enemies and avoiding death: This is not a bullet hell shooter like Touhou but for those that are not hardcore in shmups things can get pretty unpleasant. I for one will probably never finish scene 7 without taking a hit, but I won't try either. So, many people complained about the bullets being almost invisible in some places, so I think I should point out right away that there is an option to play with hideous but absolutely unmissable red hit boxes. If you ever feel the bullets just pass right through your vision into your ship, turn this option on and play the game with it. You can turn it off afterwards, and then you'll know what to pay attention to.\nPro-tip: After playing through the game with those hit boxes I have now no problem wahtsoever with 'not seeing' any bullet, when I get hit it's just me not being fast enough or picking the wrong path, even without the hideous hit boxes.\n\nAlso, you start with a small amount of shields and continues. As you play the game though you'll earn extra initial shields and continues. If you can't beat the game, play it until you have the shields and continues you need. This is a shmup after all and it's not supposed to be so terrifyingly easy that just about anyone can beat it on their first try.\n\n3. Story: Just a tiny hint here, if the story bothers you, turn it off. Yes, you don't have to skip it you can just completely remove it by switching the Cutscene Type from Original mode to Remaster. It'll prompt you every time before you start a game.\n\nNow to what is good, what is bad and should you buy this game:\n\nPositive:\n-Nice cinematics give the game a lively feeling\n-You start with a set of different weapons which need to be used strategically\n-3 different fighter modes\n\nNeutral:\n-The game switches directions a lot, I for one like it but if you can't handle it you'll probably hate it\n-No upgrades, instead you start with a bunch of different weapons\n-Story, some hate it and some others love it, I for one found it to be a tiny bit interesting but in the end it's just not anything special that captures my attention\n\nNegative:\n-The graphics and the level designs are mediocre at best.\n-No Full HD resolution\n-The game is pretty short\n-There's a level where you have to read part of the story while fighting, either bring a lot of shields and continues and read it once or ignore it\n\nAnd should you buy it? If you liked what you read above then I'd say yes, you should consider getting it during a sale though unless you're a real fan of shmups like these.","March 4, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals look even better than the original, it's that great multi-perspective shooter that keeps things fresh and exciting, the music and sound-effects are very spot on, and the game is a bit more welcoming to newcomers of the shoot 'em up genre.\n\nHowever, I do have complains and things to nit-pick about ETHER VAPOR Remaster. While the visuals are nicer, it's a real drag that it supports only 4:3 aspect-ratios up to 1600×1200 (granted that you have such a monitor), and what's ironic is that Fairy Bloom Freesia (also by Edelweiss, the makers of this game) has full support for all sorts of resolutions and aspect-ratios, so no glorious 1080p visuals on ETHER VAPOR Remaster. Other issues I have with this game that's still unfortunately present since the original is tracking your score and the tiny enemy fire. This game outright punishes those who credit-feed for practice by nuking your score unlike SITER SKAIN's titles where your score is perserved for the first credit, and the barely-visable stray bullets can lead to some cheap shots.\n\nNit-picking aside, if you like shoot 'em ups cooked on the PC but never played the original ETHER VAPOR before, this is the definitive version of the game thus far. However, if you did play the original however, you might be impressed with the much-improved visuals and extra features added into this remastered edition of ETHER VAPOR.","October 23, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are variations between levels that make this game an up-down Danmaku game, and side-to-side Danmaku game. Since this is usually a topic debated between Danmaku fans; you'll get the best of both within this game.

But that's actually what makes these games fun. 100+ retries and then when you finally beat it, you jump trough the ceiling. The game itself is nice, has enough of a story, and you can TURN ON HITBOXES. I wish you could do this in every danmaku, it makes stuff a whole lot easier!","October 8, 2013","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Just have been personally played out for my tastes. Though this one i actaully found pretty damn fun and a very well made game. If you have never played these kind of games its on the grounds of a Type R or Gradius styyle game just very fast paced and a lot going on at once on the screen.\n\nJust a fun game i have found if i want to kill 15-30 min.","May 3, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've already own ikaruga/james town/ exceed then get this. The gameplay is pretty basic, no power up or complicated scoring system. You get 3 bulltet types that can be switch on the fly and charged up, there're ships and modes to unlock as you play more of the game. Control is responsive and visual is decent. My one complain is that the bullets/enemies somtimes can get really crowded and hard to see leading to many deaths. It's not a bullet hell so don't come in expecting insane bullets pattern and crazy precise hitbox.\n\nThe game is fun to play in quick burst and it's pretty generous with giving you more credits and shield as you play.","June 21, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Difficult at the outset due to limited shields and continues, but progress and repeated play rewards the player with more of these that can be used in subsequent tries, as well as bonus ships upon completing the game. Has a fairly decent difficulty curve and a couple of flaws that can make it difficult to keep track of the player ship and enemy shots.","December 21, 2015","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
