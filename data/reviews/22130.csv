"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/recommended/22130/","miyumiayase","Miyumi Ayase","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miyumiayase/","288 products in account","NOTE 1:I think I clocked over 400 hours into this game but it was back in 2006 and before I joined Steam.\n\nNOTE 2:I'm well aware that this game has a great sequel (Hearts of Iron 3) and some people suggested I give it (Hearts of Iron 2) a thumbs down because of its age. In my opinion this is unfair. During its time, this was one of the most advanced grand strategy games around, thumbing it down because of its age is like denying that it ever existed. So why would you buy an older title? Don't know, its ultimately your money and your call. =)\n\nTL:DR? See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Hearts of Iron 2: Doomsday / Armageddon is a grand strategy political war game developed by the grand strategy masters from Paradox Development Studios and published by Paradox Interactive. Unlike its siblings (Europa Universalis, Victoria, Crusader Kings etc.) in this niche genre, the Hearts of Iron franchise covers a more modern timeline by covering the Second World War and the early parts of the Cold War (if playing the expansion Armageddon).\n\nPlayers can take command of ANY of the 175 playable Nations and rewrite history as it unfolds. The game features major historical events, world situation and military leaders, and most importantly, historically accurate technologies and armies.\n\nPROS:+ The World Map is your playground\n+ Historical Accuracy on leaders, events, technologies and provinces that allows players to...(see below)\n+ Make their own alternate history\n+ Very complex and in-depth economy and resource management system\n+ Very complex and in-depth technology tree\n+ Brutal difficulty levels\n+ Extensive replayability (over 175 playable nations)\n+ Easy to mod (specially if the player wants the historically accurate flag of 1936 Germany)\n\nCONS:- Resolution locked at 1024x768 (No HD support)\n- Very steep learning curve\n- Tutorial, though extensive, does not cover even half of the game's mechanics (you'll have to learn the other half through trial and error)\n- Some historic events sometimes do not trigger properly\n- AI can be dodgy\n- Hotkeys can't be rebound (you can see a hotkey list from the manual)\n\nCONCLUSION:GREAT GAME if you're the type of player that likes long term strategic planning and don't mind occasional wars of attrition. The game features a historically accurate 1936-1964 world with appropriate nations, their technologies, economy and historic leaders. The empire management system is very detailed, in-depth and complex that may require some time to learn and master. The graphics of the game are very simple but the easy to install mods that are available will certainly improve your experience.\n\nGrand Strategy games have a very niche audience and even among this audiences, each has their own preference of timeline. Some people like the Victorian age, Feudal Japan, Medieval Europe, Ancient Rome etc. Hearts of Iron 2 caters for those who like to play with the 20th century theme of World War 2 and the Cold War.\n\nThis game is best purchased when it is on SALE. Its easier to learn than Hearts of Iron 3 in my opinion and it makes for a good collectors item for Grand Strategy players.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

It took me some time (and the help of a friend), but if you look for a strategy game that can possibly go on for like 2 days, here you have it.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like is with steam. When starting the game per "Play"(I think its called that in english, I'm german) you can choose between the standard game without the Addons and the "real" complete version. Starting the game any other way always starts the standard game.","February 17, 2014","true","57.7"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

The possibilities are endless, allowing you to pick any nation during WW2 is a real plus. Wanna conquer China as Japan? Go Ahead! Wanna Invade California as Germany? Sure! Wanna conquer South America as Brazil, Go for it!\n\nThe AI still functions well, and the option to change the game speed from very slow to very fast really helps when you are waiting for units to finishing building so that you can continue your world domination. However, the graphics are outdated, and you may encounter some unexpected crashes. I am running Windows 7, and I have encountered a few crashes, so definitely make sure that autosave is on. Also, the multiplayer match making service is down permanently.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who is looking for a good WW2 Grand Strategy Game, but I recommend waiting until it goes on sale.","October 30, 2014","true","38.3"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

I can't wait to jump face first into some of the options, which is amazing, because there are just so many options! I've played (unsuccessfully) as Sweden and Argentina. But the losing was amazing, to see exactly where the issues with my strategy were and how things can fall apart. Each loss (I've gone down hard twice as Sweden and thrice as the Argentine) has left me annoyed, but at myself rather than against the game itself.\n\nA must have. The only things that get me down are a few technological issues given the age, mostly that I can't re-size it properly to my liking. It shows fine on my primary screen, but being unable to adjust the resolution means being unable to actually use my second screen and multitask properly. Despite this, I can't not give it at least two thumbs up. Intoxicatingly addictive.\n\nNow, to conquer the world as Canada...","May 16, 2014","true","32.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's deep and detailed yet easy enough to learn. Keep in mind though, when I say easy, I mean easy for a Grand Strategy game, for the usual RTS player it still is quite a hill to climb.\n\nThe big strategic elements are well made and fulfilling with lots to do in building your country up, fine tuning your army and position it just so. The expansions add tons to that with an expanded diplomacy system and a espionage system both of which, although not as good as the actual warfare, works fairly well.\n\nThe tactical elements is where this game really shines. Spearheads, encirclements, it's all at your fingertips. Think you could have held off the German onslaught as France? Go do it.\n\nThe music is of the usual high Paradox quality and the sounds and graphics does what little is needed.\n\nA great buy for any fan of Grand Strategy.

It's a very open-ended strategy game where you can play as any nation, and relive the WWII and early Cold War era (1936-1965), which can even turn into World War III, with Soviets and the Free World at each others' throats. However, you can play history to however you want, even making Poland into the final victor of the World War and even taking over the world piece by piece either through total control or puppetry (no joke, I've actually conquered all of Europe as Poland, but it was insanely hard). The game is not easy to play, but it's not very hard either, but it all depends on the situation you're in.\n\n8/10","June 7, 2012","true","271.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've played this off and on since I picked it up originally in high shcool, and I still come back to it, because it is a fun little game that the hours just seem to tick by.  It's kinda fun to see what happens if Italy was actually competent in WW2 (With you in charge) or how a unified South America can impact the world stage.  With editing that isn't to dificult, you can even write your own scenarios, or make whole new countries.  Worth getting if any of that sounds fun.","April 6","true","87.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Including Czechoslovakia , Austria and Hungary . Building strong armies and industry. In 1938, stay everything that has legs and hands on the borders in armored unions. After the rejection of the Munich Agreement, the Germans not attacked and I could still occupy the whole of Poland . Yugoslavia and Romania were annexed by me in 1939. In 1940, i out of boredom fired Berlin . In 1942, Paris fell , and  the same year and London . In 1945, my armored unions on the border with the Soviet Union ... SAVED like ANTI - RUSSIAN SAVE :) that was on the easiest difficulty . Luxury fun . Better than HOI 3 because it is more arcade and not so much complicated. Just good balanced game\n\nTady není co řešit ... klasika, která baví a zabaví opravdu na hodně dlouho ... 10/10\n\nEDIT :další plus jsou samožřejmě mody ... doporučuji mod Podunajské království\n\nV roce 1936 po volbách obnovena monarchie Podunajské království vedené čechoslováky. Zahrnující území Československa, Rakouska a Maďarska. Budování silné armády a průmyslu. V roce 1938 na hranicích vše co mělo ruce a nohy v silných pancéřových svazech. Po odmítnutí Mnichovské dohody si němci nasrali do kalhot a já mohl v klidu zabrat celé polsko. Jugoslávie a Rumunsko byly mnou anektovány v roce 1939. V roce 1940 sem z nudy vypálil Berlín. V roce 1942 padla Paříž a na podzim téhož roku i Londýn. V roce 1945 stojí mé pancéřové svazy na hranicích se Sovětským svazem ... ULOŽENO jako ANTI-RUSSIAN SAVE  :) tohle bylo na nejlehčí obtížnost. Luxusní zábava. Lepší než HOI 3 protože je to více arkádové a né tak moc komplikované. Prostě vyvážená kvalitní hra.","October 17, 2015","true","53.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game bring back many memories, but nowaydays if you are not adjusted with the older graphics I recommend the new ones. If you would like the HOI2 feel tho take a loot at it's sisters games Arsenal of Democracy and Darkes Hour, the gameplays is very improved and most like it. I can only recommend the Paradox Grand strategy titles and made sure to purchase them all just for trying new and old stuff!","October 25, 2015","true","59.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
