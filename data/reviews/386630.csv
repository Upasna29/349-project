The gun mechanics have been thought out well, and are quite different from other games. The rotating rooms and redirectors are an interesting challenge in themselves.\nNice graphics.\nFun puzzles.\nCheap. €3.49 at the time this was written. Even if you don't really like the game it's not a huge loss.\nCons:    Very short. 2 hours at most.\nControls feel slow. The gun doesn't follow your movements like in most games, but instead lags behind you a bit, making it feel disjointed. The jumping is also a bit dodgy. Half of the time I died was because I just walked into one of the pits without jumping.\nPoor voice acting. I'm pretty sure this was just voiced by the developer, and the lackluster delivery makes the story seem bland and uninteresting.\nBroken interactions/textures. While using the red sphere I managed to accidentally teleport myself out of the map and started falling into oblivion. Towards the end there is a blatantly missing floor that makes you wonder if you're going the wrong way.\nNo controller support. It really feels like the kind of game that would benefit from a controller.","August 2, 2015","true","2.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Many things to do in this game, and the gun provides many features (also shown in the video). Mainly, my only complaint are the voices, I have no problem listening to them, they just don't fit.\n\n9/10","July 31, 2015","true","0.4"," 12 of 24 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","12","24","2","0"

It was only $3.95 when I bought it so it wasn't that big of a deal. You can tell the actor is probably the dev or something but who cares. What you are left with after the in game dialog is a very clever game with interesting gravity mechanics. It is obiously inspired by portal but there is nothing new under the sun, so most games are like most games anymore. I recommend this game and in fact decided to try and beat it while doing a let's play after all. Cheers mates!!\n\nhttps://youtu.be/cz5Zy30v_Eg","August 7, 2015","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
