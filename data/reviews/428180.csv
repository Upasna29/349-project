But I might as well share my experience as a moderator on the community hub and getting to know the game and its developers before permanently removing this from my account. This review will probably get removed or dug deep under all the other reviews, but at least it's here. I plan to never look back at this game, review, or experience ever again.\n\nPlease keep in mind, I've idled around 20 hours on this game.\n\n~~~~\n\nThe game is buggy, very unbalanced, and definitely not worth the price of $20 (and it's on sale right now). Not only can you get spawn killed by players, but you can get spawn killed by bears too.\nIf you've played on Minecraft servers before, imagine this - entering a server that has McMMO and a few other plugins with absolutely no moderators/admins or grief protection. Playing this is the same.\nThere's no moderation on the global server, and the gameplay is a mess.\nI'd recommend Minecraft over this and even that game is trash.\n\nI'm so ashamed that I'm going to remove this game permanently from my account because it's too late to refund. Even after supporting the developers (and moderating their community, suggesting several features and bug fixes), the developers decided to treat me like garbage. I explained my situation to them, they promised a full refund. One day later, they've deleted me and completely ignore me now as if I was never there to support the game and community. The developers are immature, unprofessional (even though they claim they're professional), and can't keep their word.\n\nWhat a waste of money. I've already told a few others of this game and they will not be buying it. Early access or not. I should've just flushed my $20 down the toilet.\n\nThanks for this experience that I regret deeply, morenori soft.","February 6","false","35.8"," 262 of 349 people (75%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","75","262","349","25","27"

Islet Online is a creative open world sandbox, similar to Minecraft. This game features an experience system that allows you to level up in pretty much everything like jumping, crafting, fighting and much more. These can directly effect your play experience, for example, you may be able to eventually jump up to 4 times in the air. It actually reminds me of McMMO from the old Minecraft Bukkit days.\n\nPositives:\nThe devs push out updates and bug fixes at the speed of light. They listen to player reports, and act quickly.\nThis game runs very smooth, with only the occasional hiccup.\nThe art style is cute and fun to look at, especially the player characters. The music is great too!\nThere's quite a bit of crafting you can do.\nLeveling up everything(that works) is worth your time. For example: Higher crafting level = Higher % success rate.\nThere is a working party system so you can play with your friends. They get marked on the minimap!\nThere are lots of block-types, all of which have their own uses.\nThe ecosystem is fun. If no predators are around, you will have bunnies for DAYS.\nYou can befriend animals.\nSeems to support all or most resolutions, and has windowed mode.\nThere are multiple worlds you can teleport to, they seem to contain exclusive ores.\nThere's a night/day AND weather cycle, and all the animals go to sleep. (Easy pickings)\nThere is PvP!\nYou can craft and equip several gear-types on yourself.\nThe community is one of the nicest I've ever seen.\nYou can host your own server.\nNegatives:\nThose looking for an objective or "point" to doing things, you'll want to pass on this game for now.\nThere are spelling and grammatical errors EVERYWHERE. It drives me crazy!\nThe camera likes to get stuck in cramped spaces, preventing you from interacting with the environment. Bad for mining.\nThe controls sometimes don't work right with no rhyme or reason.\nPlayers can become glitched in all manner of ways. From being unable to join a group to health not working right.\nThere are no tutorials to help you get started.\nThe map is not generated as you travel, there is an end. It's big enough though.\nSometimes interactive blocks will stop working. (Such as doors) Fixed!\nYou have to do quite a bit of grinding to make your character useful.\nA lot of skills aren't working yet. (But they sound really cool)\nSo is it worth it?\nThat depends what kind of player you are. Those that need objectives or for there to be "a point" to keep themselves going will definitely want to pass, at least for now. If you're the type of player who enjoys Minecraft, and you don't mind lots of grinding, then you'll definitely like this game and I can easily recommend it to you. You have to really make your own experience here, which is much easier if you play with friends. There's tons to do, tons to improve, and of course- so many things to build. Hope to see you guys out in the world!\n\n\n(Did you like this review? If so, please vote it up!

As long you use it, others people can't steal your house, hit your house with axe, or something like that\n- Night and day cycle with weather cycle, but right now it's only rain storm\n- PvP and PvE using different world/server which is nice\n- I believe you can host your own world and only invited people can join, such as your friend\n- The devs always update and willing to answer players on the forum\n- Good optimization, but only few graphic option of choice such as fullscreen-windowed, and resolution\n- Tutorial just like objective/quest in this game, it flow within gameplay (I hope to see more objective in future patch)\n- You can riding animals in later update\n- The music is good\n\nThe Bad and The Ugly\n- Only 3 animals available right now: Mr.Bear, piggy, bunny (I didn't see a single wolf for now or maybe they extinct?)\n- There's no hunger system but be able to hunt bunny? (maybe later update?)\n- The controls not so bad, there are 2 controls: Minecraft style or click style just like Terraria and Starbound but sometimes I'm always fall down from my house and died\n- The combat mode uggggghhhhh so bad, need some rework\n- The world feels empty without birds, its lifeless without it\n\nThis game needs\n- Farming system\n- Hunger, thristy, and wet when rain\n- Swimming\n- Fishing (I think the dev update it later)\n- More monster lurking around inside tunnel or world\n- NPC\n- Workshop\n\nDo not see negative reviews, they are not true. This game is good and have potential\nI choose this game over Creativerse, Terraria, and Starbound. I hope Morenori Soft didnt dissapoint us. Sorry for my bad English, it's not my native language still learning.","March 13","true","6.7"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","30","31","5","2"

But one that would be updated even more, This game seems to be updated daily with new stuff, so that looks promising\n\nThe Stuff I Like\n1: the art style is really nice, it is one of those games that has a block based enviroment with non-blocky characters and manages to make it look nice\n\n2: the amount of skills is great, you can gain levels for climbing and jumping, or swordsmanship and archery, the choice is yours and if you choose to advance in a skill you gain rewards for doing so\n\n3: there is a built in protection system, this allows you to "claim" a large chunk of land for you to build in. You can of course build anywhere, but the stuff you build inside here is protected from other people who might want to ruin your creations\n\n4: There is an active enviroment. During the day in each map, there is a changing amount of animals and plants, if you kill animals, more plants will grow, if you kill more plants, the number of animals may decrese in that area\n\n5: there are changing "mining worlds" in these worlds, named the "Isle of ____" there will be a main material that is in the ground, there is only one of these at a time and they swap out through the week, but you can use them to gain a large amount of materials, if you need say iron, but the isle is on marble or something you can still find what you need, but it will be harder\n\nStuff I dont really like\n1: Gold and silver smelting, the percent chance for the gold and silver to successfully smelt is a bit low at the moment, with silver being at a 10 percent sucess rate no matter how high you get your smelting rank, and gold being at 1 percent. The devs did say they would talk about this though, so that sounds pretty nice\n\n2: Crafting is kinda slow. each item you have to craft has a small amount of time that it takes before being made, like 1.5 seconds for a piece of armor. This isnt much of a problem for single items, but if you have a couple hundred bricks you wanna make, it will take a while. A good solution to this would be to make the crafting time get faster and faster the more items you craft\n\nOverall thoughts\nthis game is very fun, i would recommend you get it if you have played cube world before. The game is in early access but i feel as if it is already fun enough to be a full game, there are some issues but they do not mess with my experience with the game, and the devs seem to be very active as well, i would give this game a thumbs up.","March 26","true","45.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","11","12","3","0"

I love how you can tame animals and they have lifespans and reproduce etc. If you love leveling up your character then this is the game for you. Everythine you do gives you xp and I really like how different tress and blocks have different levels to them requiring your level to be high enough to mine or chop them faster. The game feels very fluid and for early access It has a lot for you to do and the DEVS update it regularly. There are no "monsters" at the moment and I don't know if there will be but there ARE predators like wolves and bears etc that will wreck your world. This could very well be the NEXT BIG GAME if it keeps going in the right path.\n\nPros:\n\nBIGGES PRO IMO: TREE ROOT TREE ROOT TREE ROOT!!!!!!!!!!!! (makes it so when you are done chopping wood off    of a big ♥♥♥ tree you can then go and chop the tree root in red letters and it will destroy the remaining parts of the tree including pesky leaves and floating ♥♥♥♥"\nDynamic Wildlife that reproduces and have lifespans.\nGameplay is very fluid\nRegular updates\nBeing able to play single player, Multiplayer with friends or Global Multiplayer on one main server\n(with that being said your character and world are seperate so you can transfer your leveled up character between worlds)\nCombat is fun\nCrafting\nSound Effects\nBeing able to edit the world seed\n\nCons: I wish the worlds were procedurally generated but im sure they will hopefully add that in a future update\n\nNo shaders atm but there will be since they have a shader option in the graphics menu but it is greyed out\n\nTextures are kind of plain atm but that will most likely change in time too\n\nNo Biomes atm but I think there will be","April 6","true","5.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Using an axe to chop wood improves logging and axe skill)\n- The game has a very grindy route to play, but you could avoid this by trading with other players or having them craft with your materials. (rewards sinking time into the game)\n- A vast amount of armor types and materials to make it off of, especially for it's initial early access release.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Korean to English translations are inaccurate in many cases.\n- The Grind for players who prefer not to.\n- There are a large amount of skills not yet implemented, and the loom is useless currently.\n- There are quite a few bugs.\n\nWill update review as game progresses.","February 2","true","21.3"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","12","20","3","0"

It causes steam to crash and leaves an unkillable process on my CPU.\n\nThis is a minecraft clone, except not as good as minecraft.\n\nAlso... the store page lies. There are not 100s of skills, and no NPCs. I want a refund.","February 11","false","18.3"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"
