It's not a game. Developer is talking about it being a VR game. Why they display it in simulator, I don't know. It's not doing anything and the ship doesn't even sail.","October 29, 2015","false","0.4"," 41 of 61 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","41","61","5","5"

I only played very briefly and felt motion-sick (I work with VR headsets every day, it takes a lot to make me feel queezy in VR). Some interactive objects also unexpectedly moved the camera, causing sudden disconnect that added to my nausea.\nCollision is a little all over the place, can often just walk through stuff.\nGeneral framework/layout and experience is missing, no menus or any sort of introduction into what's going on.\n\nGraphics are lovely however, but they don't make up for the lack of content. With the above fixed, I still can't see this for more than £1.99 on Steam.","November 14, 2015","false","0.1"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","4"

It's not a game as such, but as an exploration/sitting around admiring the view experience, it's fantastic. The visuals look great and the minigames are entertaining (particularly flying as the bird). If you're looking for somewhere to just hang out in VR, this is perfect.","April 22","true","0.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was nervous about getting seasick, but fortunately that never became a problem.\n\nThe graphics are some of the best I've seen in VR.  Hopefully the devs will add more content as they did to Aerie, because I'd like to spend more time here.  It's well worth the price if you love pirate ships.","May 23","true","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The model is good but movement feels strange and there are frequent glitches with lighting and collisions. No options menu of any kind. Has potential to be a cool exploration experiance.

The authentic Galleon is quite cool to explore and there are a ton of neat little surprise actions hidden throughout the game (things to open, things to activate, things to briefly enter the POV of). The graphics are great, but the movement is a bit odd and gave me pretty strong nausea. I'm looking forward to trying this in room scale with the vive, but I really think the movement will need something like Cloudhead's Blink locomotion or cloudstep.\n\nI have to recommend against the game at the $9.99 pricepoint in its current state. Given an updated movement system and some bugfixes for some minor graphical glitches, or a drop in pice to 2-3 dollars, I'd change this to a yes.","November 6, 2015","false","0.7"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","2"

But as others have said, don't go into it expecting "gameplay". You basically can roam around a couple environments, and interact with a few objects (i.e. fire cannons).\n\nPositives:\n\n-Great Graphics/Visuals\n\n-Several Interesting and unexpected interactions\n\n-Boobies\n\nNegatives:\n\n-Needs further optimization. i5 4690K and R9 390 were not enough to be completely judder free in all areas. Island was especially bad.\n\n-$10 seems steep for the lack of replay value\n\n-Controls could be improved, and maybe add a pause menu with controls listed.","November 16, 2015","false","0.2"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","6","13","2","3"

While some may feel (correctly), that this is not a game, these VR "experiences" still provide much opportunity to entertain as the developer VROOM has crammed in many little details that elevate this to near simulation status, while also providing the user with many items to interact with.\n\nPro's:  SCALE!!   From the very start, you can appreciate the incredible sense of scale this experience provides.  You start off in the middle of a Galleon, with the first thing that catches your eyes are the high mast, then the size of the ship, the cannon's, etc.  Not that I've ever been on one but.., it just feels right and the 3D conveyed here once again shows why VR is a winner to anyone who tries it!\n\nGraphics:  Everything is rendered well, with above average texture work.  The water though helps elevate the experience to another level as it's quite beautiful and flat out hypnotising.   I caught myself staring a few times, just looking out into the distance.\n\nInteraction:  There are many items (the description lists 74).  I won't list them here (the entire point of VR experiences is to... experience these for yourselves) but there's a sufficient amount that it should lead me to keep searching to find them all.  I will say some of the secrets show a decent amount of imagination! LOL  Word of warning... stay off the sauce; if not, you'll regret it.. especially in VR!!  :)\n\nIssues:  The only glitch I've seen on the current version is once I was in the water, depending on where I gaze, there seemed to be glitches on the edge of my peripheral vision.  Nothing horribly bad nor that distracting but should be mentioned just the same.\n\nRecommendation:  For me, absolutely a worthwhile experience, however, there is always room for improvement.  Same as others, I would love to be able to sail and/or attack other ships but understand the engine doesn't currently allow this level of interaction while keeping this required frame rate.  Fair enough, but maybe more could be added via:\n\n- something to keep track of the interactive objects you've discovered (ie; achievements). This would greatly expand on the user's need to keep exploring (we love to catch ‘em all!)\n- more items to interact with, I guess we can never have enough ;)\n- Adjusting the canon's so that we can turn them into a target mini-game (or sinking ships in the distance along the lines of classic arcade games of old... including keeping track of high-scores)\n\nRecap and rating:  although not a game per say, this experience still hits home and is a success. There's lots to do, the quality is evident and although there is room for improvement, IMHO from a POV of experience, it's a worthwhile investment.  I rate this experience a 4 out of 5 stars.\n\nlooking forward to seeing what's next from VRoom!\n","November 7, 2015","true","0.5"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"
