The overly-vast wastelends of the Louisiana Bayou which you will spend hours traveling through? Was it your horrible, unresponsive controls? How about that even thinking about right clicking your mouse will minimize the game window?\n\nNo, it's not those. Even those sins could be forgiven. Where Duck Dynasty has gone wrong is in its very conception—in the idea that a game based on a reality television show centering around the manufacture of duck calls could provide any modicum of pleasure. The idea that a game in which your goal is to become less educated, less competent and less civilized such that you—a teenage boy—can fit in with a group of 40-something-year-old men. The idea that making digitzed versions of these very rednecks and voicing them with poor quality recordings, while occasionally cutting in television clips ever-so-loosely related to the plot at hand.\n\nThat's where this game went wrong. That's the concept which above any other has offended me. And that, along with everything, is why you should not play this game.","October 14, 2014","false","6.5"," 3,196 of 3,569 people (90%) found this review helpful 218 people found this review funny","90","196","3","218","140"

From there the game is shaped as a day in the life of a Robertson as you go through your initiation into the Duck Dynasty.  The environment is open to the Robertson ranch letting you free roam and explore but mostly servers as a conduit between quests.  Quests are simple coming in four varieties all falling in line and helping to progress the story where required.\n\nThe mission types are; a Red light/Green light exercise having you sneaking around when setting up pranks, airboat races, duck hunting, and fishing.  While there are no sneak missions repeatable in the mini game series you can retry any of the other three.\n\nThe hunting experience is pretty neat, you look out from your blind for ducks to call in which requires you to press corresponding face buttons similar to rhythm games, allowing you to then pick your spot to unload as your called ducks come to settle.\n\nFishing was also pretty unique of a feel.  You push off dock in your little boat looking for activity around the lake (or hotspots) to set up at.  From there you continue to pursue their activity casting out your lure, waiting to react at the right timing for a bite.  Reeling it in is then a challenge of pulling back on the rod (RT) while maintaining a steady line, preventing your catch from jerking around and breaking the line (use right stick to keep reel, rod, and the sort lined up)\n\nThat's about all I can say about the game, if you're looking for an easy, laid back, hunting type game then this could be to your enjoyment.","January 22, 2015","true","20.9"," 41 of 194 people (21%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","21","41","194","16","3"

You play as The Robertsons young John Luke on his way to becoming a man.  The game takes you thorough  various tasks such as driving an ATV, airboat racing,  duck calling, leaning how to shoot  ducks with a shotgun, to shotgun golf, fishing and frog catching,  as well as pranking  family members. I've only scratched the surface yet, but thought it was worth posting a review now.\n\nThe game is advertised as an open world game, but I found the game a little directed and linear in places. That said, I've throughly enjoyed playing the game so far and look forwards to more Roberstons fun when I next play the game.  If you've followed the Robertson family over the last six series (new 7th season starts 14th November 2014) you'll probably get a good laugh out of this game.  It won't be everyones cup of tea so I'd consder checking out the demo  of Redneck Logic  which is available HERE[www.aetv.com].

If you're a fan and don't mind playing a simple game that doesn't take much thought, that buy it.
