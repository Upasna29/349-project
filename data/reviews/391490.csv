I completed the whole game on Hard and it took me around 15 hours. The music is perfect but there is only 1 or 2 of them in loop.\n\nThe graphics are 2D but with cool colors. The story is fine . You travel accross the islands to level up get gear and gold and upgrade the number of your army. There is a talent tree so u can choose your gameplay offensive,defensive or rage build.\n\nAfter each battle you earn gold and experience and  you repair the number of guys you lost in battle with gold.\n\nThere is 3 modes  easy,normal and hard and you can change whenever you want but watch out there is a couple achievements about not changing it .\n\nThere is achievements for the 100% game hunters :)\n\nI would give it a 3.8 out of 5\n\nSorry if my english was bad and i hope you will enjoy this game\n\nMelovia","September 14, 2015","true","20.5"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","34","43","2","4"

That was the biggest problem with Wizard, and in Pirate it is evidently properly taken care about.\n\nBut changes, and most of them to the good, are numerous. You hero is now represented with a unit on the battlefield, which in theory limits your choice of troops to be taken with, but I haven't found it to be a hindrance. The hero unit is, on the other side, quite useful and perfectly serves both as a damage dealer and a magnetic absorber of enemies' ranged attacks. The hero attibutes do not affect the army anymore, which is not much of loss, since they their bonuses were neglectable anyway. Instead they affect the hero unit only, which works fine with artefacts now being many and mostly useful. The levelcap has also been increased to level 15.\nRecruitable units are now grouped into pools, with units from each pool being available for hire in any one of tavern network scattered around, which saves you quite some time. Dungeons now have limits, which is fine for me as well.\nThere are quite a few other new interesting features introduced, but I'll stop here, and let you discover by yourself.\n\nOverall, the best thing of all is that the game feels now much more solid, mature and well-designed, if compared with the prior parts. It is evident, that this time the developers have put a notable amount of effort into improving and polishing of the game, and I'd say that they have definetely succeded.","October 13, 2015","true","14.4"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

The three storylines aren't related, so you can play them in any order. However, I would recommend to play them as they are supposed to be ( Braveland  =>  Wizard   =>  Pirate ). Keep the best for the end : Pirate is, in my opinion, the most entertaining and enjoyable game of the series.\n\nBraveland Pirate is a turn-based strategy game with three difficutly levels, in which Jim, a new pirate rookie, will have to find the missing parts of the treasure map and manage his crew. The game combines the best of the previous games and introduces some new ideas and improvements.\nThe playable character is, this time, a unit that you can control in the battles\nNew and more elaborated skill tree\nNew spells system : every time a unit attacks, you accumulate rage points that allow you to use tricks (speed bonus, healing, etc)\nPirate universe, so there are accordingly new units\nLess linear game : there are 7 islands and you can come and go as you please\nThere are a few dungeons again, but they are not endless as in Braveland Wizard. You can only fight x times per dungeon\nSea encounters\nBetter survival system (tricks, skills)\nEquipment diversity\nMore choices\nOptional quests","April 16","true","30.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You don't need to play the first two to beat this one, however it is pretty cool to see some of the units you had in the previous games as enemies. Also, there's one spot where an old man ask you questions pertaining to the old games, but you can find those online or just not bother with that achievement.\n\nThe game itself is pretty good, just like the other two. This one seems to be about 12 hours to beat on the hardest difficulty if you go for all the extra stuff that you can actually accomplish in one play through. That alone is worth the asking price in my opinion for a strategy game.\n\nThere's\n-5 units to choose from like the first two\n-there's a skill tree type thing like in the second one-\nthere's "hidden" treasure chests throughout the islands\n-there's mutliple islands to visit\n-there's dungeons to earn extra gold and experience after you beat levels or you can go out to sea and try to get random encounters instead\n-there's a couple of different equipments you can strive to get to become more powerful\n-there's multiple ways to build your squad\nand since it's a strategy game there's multiple ways to play.\n\nIt does feel a little bland compared to the first two to be quiet honest and I'm not sure why or what could be changed to alter that, but I still think it's a decent enough game. I don't think it has replay value though. I was going to go back through to get the achievements I couldn't get the first time, but I got bored after just a few levels and decided to just write this instead. To be fair, I don't think any game has much replay value unless it has online multiplayer or co-op though.\n\nEasily worth a pick up if you played the first two or you just like chill little strategy games","December 15, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is the third of a three part adventure offered by Tortuga Team, exploring the adventures of different characters in the world. I have played and reviewed the original game in this trilogy, and I found it to be a small, enjoyable game with a tight knit story that drew me in, and a balanced gameplay with a solid, strong hero. The same, unfortunately, can not be said for Braveland Pirates.\n\n\nThe overall impression I got of this game was that they tried to expand upon their original idea, and overshot it. You play as a pirate that travels to various islands in order to collect pieces of a map which lead you to a legendary treasure. Other than that, the dialogues, companions and storytelling doesn't build into feeling like a pirate, or the captain of your crew. None of the story adds any depth into feeling like a pirate adventure. The units you work with and unlock throughout the game do not hold up tactically to the increase in difficulty as you progress. There are some exceptions to this rule, as I go over in the video review ,but in addition, when you enter later stages of the game, you are limited as to what units are available, and are forced to use some units simply because you have no other option due to lack of balance in between the units. The lack of units that are available also means that you are fighting many, many battles with the same units.\n\nWhen there are limited troops available, and therefore limited mechanics, this adds to the feeling of grinding or repetition throughout the battles. It falls to the strength of the story to pull the player into the game, and unfortunately, this game has failed in that aspect, as the story is poorly written and structured. The hero does have talents that he can earn throughout the game, but these talents which can be useful, lack any feeling of power as you level up, it is felt more through the gear and weapons that you pick up.\n\nI do not fault the game for being simple in its style or mechanics, but I feel that there needed to be certain adjustments to the hero, the troops and the mechanics in order feel like a flushed out game of this size. The game did not respect my time. Even on the hardest setting, the difficulty is a joke! As long as you have a basic knowledge of this style of genre, that is. The main times I had any trouble was situational to do the really bad balance at some points. You are limited in your hero's development, and in the support units you choose. I wanted to like this game, and went into it expecting a continuation of the experience I had in the first game. Instead I felt that my time was wasted.\n\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho\n","October 28, 2015","false","13.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","7","16","0","0"

They're fairly casual turn based strategy games, with a little bit of RPG and stat-building. This one started off a little on the difficult side, even on Regular difficulty, but by the halfway point, I was overpowered enough that I think I only lost one fight from that point.  The art and gameplay is as charming as ever, and the story, such as it is, does a good job of separating the game sections out.  If you haven't played the other Braveland games, you should still be able to get through this without any problem, and there really isn't much connectivity between the three games.  But if you want a fairly casual turn based strategy game, this series is a good starter. Though I would recommend Renowned Explorers for a slightly deeper Turn Based experience.  This game took about 11 hours to finish.","May 15","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(There are 5 Volume balls)\nYou can change the Music Volume. (There are 5 Volume balls).\nYou can play in windowed mode or fullscreen mode.\nYou can change the resolution size.\nThere is an EASY/MEDIUM and a HARD difficulty.\nMusic is alright in the main menu.\n\nAbout the game.\nThe game plays very simple. You play on a story driven game and you usually play and walk on 1 straight line on the world map. There are some multiple directions but you are always pointed to 1 location. You control units and you move 1 unit at a time. The speed of the character will decide how fast he is able to do his turn again. The more units(higher number), the higher their damage will be. They have a health bar and if that depletes to 0, then you lose 1 unit. Units can be rebought from a tavern or location or refilled after a battle (Which automatically will cost you some victory coins). During a combat you are able to turn on the health bar and if you right click on an enemy or your own unit. Then you will be able to see their status. Units will usually only relatiate once, Unless they have some kind of attribute or effect.  You are able to use and unlock abilities. Each hit that you do against an enemy unit will give you 1 ability point.\n\nFunny Interesting Story.\nMain Character is able to Level up.\nSmall Skill tree.\nNice artwork.\nNice Cartoony graphics.\nCombat Music is the same from all other games.\nWell explained Small tutorial ingame\nCould be a bit grindy.\n\nOther things.\nThere are 3 braveland series. This is "Part 3". Braveland is part 1, Braveland Wizards part 2. All of the games plays almost the same.\n\nThe game plays similiar like the game series from  "Heroes of might and magic" (Good game btw).\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 8/10\n","May 28","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
