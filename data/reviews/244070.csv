I really tried to enjoy this (I put in the time!), but it has none of the 'one-more-turn' addictiveness of his other games.\n\nSo why is it so bad you ask?\n\nEach map looks almost identical, graphics look like direct port from mobile platform, the mission types you can count on one hand & the game itself is very short covering 24 missions across 4 campaigns. They can go quick too! You do not feel there is any progression as you go through as the game centres around your score; having little in the way of feeling like you are winning a war. There is no territory to defend or conquer instead you choose from 3 random missions then up to 4 pilots to progress through each level. Pilot & plane upgrades are rewarded as you proceed through your game, but only really make it easier to win & that isn't really a strong point when the 'Legend' difficulty is not really very challenging. Legend (besides boosting your score) just makes it more frustrating than anything else since the opposing pilots get big stats boosts making it take a painfully long time to shoot them down yet much easier for you to be shot down.\n\nTactically you will find many dogfights are reduced to both of you flying around in circles for multiple moves until the AI decides to fly out giving you an opening to attack. You can try different tactics but it always comes back to 'circling' from my experience. Once you get behind someone it is very hard for them to get away (unless they're an Ace pilot), and likewise when the roles are reversed. It makes the first few turns of your engagment most important, but then very predictable after that. To add to this, I also couldn't play this on my old PC with ATI graphics as it wouldn't render the display, showing all white, so I have only been able to play recently since I got my new PC with NVidia graphics.\n\nAll said & done, I can't help but to ask myself why Sid would put his name on such a sub-par game, let alone make a sequel! Also milking it further by charging almost twice as much locally in AU @ $8.99 instead of US @ $4.99 (still well overpriced for what you get if you ask me).\n\nVery disappointing! :(\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","March 13, 2014","false","18.5"," 81 of 93 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","81","93","0","3"

Each player would select an aerial maneuver in an attempt to gain a positional advantage over their opponent. Based on the comparison of the maneuvers chosen, each player would be directed to turn to a page in their book that gave the view from their cockpit and another series of maneuvers from which to chosen. Sid Meier's Ace Patrol uses the power of the personal computer to do the same thing.\n\nSid Meier's Ace Patrol is a simple one or two player game simulating air combat in World War I. The game avoids the immersive experience of a first-person flight simulator and the more complex physics that the experience brings. Instead, the game uses a hexagon based movement system with a view of action from the side, much like a board game. Flight physics is simplified by giving the player a selection of "legal" maneuvers so you don't have to worry about pushing your pilot or aircraft beyond its limits. Airspeed doesn't play a factor in the game and altitude is generalize to one of four levels (well, five if you count the ground). It was very easy to learn the game's mechanics despite the lack of documentation. There is a tutorial and hints are displayed at the beginning of each scenario.\n\nThe game itself is set up in a campaign style. The player selects one of four nationalities (British, American, French or German) and a special skill for one of their pilots. During the game, players manage a squadron of four pilots, selecting skill upgrades as pilots increase in experience and aircraft upgrades as the squadron completes missions. The player has the option of switching aircraft types for each pilot between missions. Aircraft have five characteristics that they are rated from one to five to allow players a general understanding of each type's performance against other aircraft.\n\nCovering the years between 1916 and 1918, the player's squadron participates in four campaigns with six battles each. Each battle presents the player with 1 to 3 different missions with varying degrees of difficulty and reward. Missions are performed either over friendly territory or enemy territory. The location of the mission will determine what side of the map the objective is on. Landing behind enemy lines will result in your pilot being captured as a prisoner of war and unavailable for the remainder of the campaign. Crash landing in friendly territory will result in injuries that will keep the pilot out of battle for a number of missions. Missions available are randomly selected with the exception of the final battle which appears to always be a "boss fight" against an enemy zeppelin and its fighter escort.\n\nI found the game to be a highly enjoyable simulation of air combat with a small element of asset management. Missions are short and the entire game can be completed within few hours. The randomization of missions for each battle provides extended replayability. Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol is a simple game with a simple interface that is a delight to play.","January 13","true","73.6"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","47","51","2","0"

In a mere hour, I blew through half of the missions. You get to see the mission grid, much like other mobile games. You get four pilots / planes and pilot them on missions. Mostly blow up other planes. Sometimes, blow up tanks or zeplins. The game is turn based and played out on a hexigrid with each plane getting a certain amount of spaces based on their speed or altitude.\n\nAs you progress mission after mission, your planes / pilots will level up and gain skills you can chose from. You will also unlock upgrades to equip to your 4 planes. These skills feel useless and very subtle. You don't need the skills or upgrades before you get them. Never once did I feel like now that upgrade will totally help me do better.\n\nThis is just a very dull game. The maps look identical. The only real thing you even need to concern yourself with each map is enemy territory that will shoot you down, but enemy territory is so sparse, that you'll barely run into it. Plus its easy to avoid. The only way to hide from an enemy is hang out in clouds, but since you operate planes, you cannot really stay in clouds since you'll always be moving.\n\nAvoid this game. Maybe on a phone it would be more fun to kill a bit of time with, but on PC, its just too easy to blow through.","April 14, 2014","false","0.9"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","50","66","2","0"

Made for smart phones and Tablets originally but ported to the PC and beamed into our collective HD using the magic that is STEAM Ace Patrol is about two things. Biplane Hex Combat and more importantly fun.\n\nGameplay is basically this. You pick a nation (UK, France, Imperial Germany or America!)  and each nation has a selecton of randomly generated pilots with aeroplanes of the era and you dogfight the enemy using a turn based hex combat system. Your squadron can have up to four Pilots who fly a series of randomly generated missions over four different offensives against NPC pilots who like your own can be captured or forced temporary out of the war to repair their damaged crates. Both friendly and enemy squadron Pilots unlock RPG-esqe skills, upgrades for their planes and learn special manauvers that give them the upper hand in combat. Oh and as the offensive progresses so does air technology for both sides. You might be flying easy one moment and then the enemy has a fancier crate with another set of wings and a bigger gun to keep you on your toes!\n\nCombat itself is pretty simple, get a good shot under or behind the enemy plane whilst not exposing yourself to the dangers of their wingmans guns or AA gun fire. You are graded with a score system that is tied to the general STEAM achivements and online leaderboard for said game. To increase the score obviously you'll have to ratchet up the difficulty level (or be lucky enough to get a Pilot with the DOUBLE SCORE ability).\n\nThe other feature to keep you playing again is once you complete a Offensive with a certain nation the first time you unlock famous WW1 Ace Pilots with their own biplane livery schemes.\n\nBugs wise I've only encountered one and that sometimes you have some trouble clicking on a hex, this gets really fiddly when your Pilot has a million manuvers and you really don't want to select the FORCE LANDING one. I expect this is to do with it being more of a Tablet game really. Also, some of the art assets are slightly bland (Don't get excited about seeing the Offensive Victory screen more than once)  despite the fact they did their best locked more or less in a single location.\n\nIs it worth buying though? sure, why not if you want a addictive but slighty short turn based aeroplane game . But for the best value get it in a Sale and make sure you pick up the rather decent WW2 Pacific Campaign sequal at the same time.","November 27, 2013","true","11.3"," 43 of 56 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","43","56","0","0"

Two months have passed, and today I finally realized it was time I tried it.... and damn!

I've only been playing for a few hours, and while I'm sure the more advanced missions and the harder difficulty levels can make the game very challenging and complex, it's very begginer-friendly on 'easy mode', so I'm quite happy that for once, I put my ego aside and started with the lowest difficulty level (I usually choose "Normal" or whatever the medium difficulty level is called).\n\nUgh, not sure how to summarize this, so I'll just go grab something to eat.

If you've ever played a civilization game in your life you will instantly recognize the hex grid across which you direct your squadron. There are some really neat concepts here; each pilot has their own flight competencies which enable them to take increasingly more aggressive maneuvers. As you navigate the battlefield you must take into account all of the factors one normally would in a flight combat simulator. From the angle of attack and altitude all the way to the direction you’re currently banking, every aspect affects the options you have for your next turn.\nIt’s a neat game, but I would love to see it brought back with more graphical polish and a more robust tutorial. During my time playing, everything felt very disjointed and fragmented. It’s not a bad little strategy game, but doesn't feel fully realized.","December 4, 2014","true","3.2"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

This is a game that you can pick up and run with in a coffee break, but will still draw you in for the long sessions. Originally made for mobile devices, it's short sweet and simple. this is reflected in the price, so it's easy to buy with no regrets. The Graphics aren't amazing, but they don't leave your eyes bleeding. Things kinda look like the things they should look like, and the style reminded me of "WINGS" waaay back in my Amiga days. The controls are fairly straightforward, and the icons make it obvious. (a twisty arrow beside you means "roll this way" an arrow curling upwards means "Climb" etc) so there is no need for a long training mission, just enough to check you can click and tell how to shoot the enemy. The different factions and their planes are given special commands or abilities which fit in without intruding (some turn faster, some have better guns, etc)\nIf you see it on sale, remember that you can download it faster than you read this review. I guarantee it'll make a train journey fly past, (especially in 2-player hotseat mode) or make a nice break between "serious" games on your rig at home.","November 29, 2013","true","13.4"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

It's like the Panzer Corps of the sky (although with less pieces and less missions). Its a lot of fun and it never really gets old as you will always be competing to get the best pilots possible! Ever seen the Blue Max? Now you can fight to win Germany's highest aviation medal in this game! The war develops and so do your planes. Ace Patrol Pacific sky's I also highly recommend because its more missions and more planes! Plus there are acutally battles where your planes keep damage points until the battle finishes, so you have to be careful. I hope they continue this game series because its really fun! Need to enterain yourself for a few minutes? Then this game is perfect! It's got hotseat to so you can battle against your brother, sister and your friends!\n\nBut wait what about all those bad reviews saying that this game has lots of glitches and every mission is the same? Thats not remotely true in my opinion. I've never had a single error and I doubt the majority of players do. None of my friends have had those problems either. The game is extremely simple and its fun to play. You can pick it up in ten minutes and be an expert player in a day! Wont it get really old then real soon? No, it wont! You can adjust the difficulty and it actually changes the way you have to play the game. Shure, that applies to almost every game with difficulty settings. You can also change your nation and each nation dosent play the same. I've found Germany and the United States to have the hardest campaigns. France and Britian get pretty good planes early, the Germans too, but in most missions the odds are stacked against the Germans. The United States has a troublesome time getting the good balanced planes that players crave (the triplane has more guns but it goes down in flames a lot)\n\nAnyway, I want you to ask yourself (if your considering ♥♥♥♥♥ing this game). Is it worth it? Based on this description, does it captivate my attention? If yes, then look no further. If no, you should probably whatch some gameplay, and if thats not enough, then try to see if you have a friend who will let you play for a while.

The farily simple controls (steer plane forward, dive, bank, and later on, ace maneuvers) mixed with the variety of game mechanics (choosing appropriate planes, upgrades, pilots, etc. for the mission(s) at hand) allow for a huge replay value, and interesting and fun gameplay. I have only played the game through once, as France, but I plan to beat it again at least once as every different country, and see the new options that come with fighting for a different side. I would reccomend this game to anyone who liked the Civilization games, or similarly structured games, but wants a slightly faster and lighter game.","April 7, 2014","true","8.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

However, i can recommend this game because even that way you can enjoy it a lot like me, and the asked price is very low, mostly if compared to other games from the same developer and/or publisher.\n\nYou start choosing the German or one of the three allied nations from WWI: British, French or American - each one with an specific perk and different planes to fly. Then you choose from a variety of missions to run - like Ace vs Ace, escort, bombardment and defense missions, to cite some - leveling your pilots and granting upgrades and new maneuver trees to use with them in the turn-based hex field.\n\nAce Patrol have a lot of resources, but they are just concepts of a potentially deep bad-♥♥♥ strategy game. At the actual stage you must face it more like a casual than a strategy game, and may experience some frustration at realizing that not a polished, not even finished game as it is.\n\nYou can finish a campaign on easy difficult in about 2 hours, but the achievements are really exciting to pursue, and the gameplay although simple and glitched is very engaging and funny.","February 17, 2014","true","38.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The gameplay is very repetitive, but at least refreshing new in the begining. Altough turn based, the planes can only be moved in dependence of the last movement. So you can't fly forward and turn 180° in the next turn unless you pilot learned the Split-S or Immelman Turn. Also the planes behave differently, some are more manouverable, others faster. So you can get a few hours of entertainment out of this game, but don't expect anything like Civ (gametime spent wise).","May 3, 2014","true","16.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/recommended/244070/","dpxmsk","DeadPoolX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dpxmsk/","1183 products in account","Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is a fun, although highly unrealistic at times, turn-based strategy game set during The Great War (aka World War I). How much you enjoy it, however, depends on several factors, all of which shall be discussed in this review.\n\nThe first thing many gamers on Steam will notice is that the graphics aren't particularly high-res and the options menu within the game is severely limited. You can't even set the game's resolution and as far as I can tell, there's no anti-aliasing at all.\n\nThe reason for this is because SMAP was originally an iOS title.\n\nWhat's the difference between the iOS app and the PC game? The mobile game is free, but requires that you pay for additional content. The PC version demands payment up front, but there no additional fees, optional or otherwise. The iOS version also uses a touch-screen interface as well, while the PC uses the mouse.\n\nThe game's audio is quite nice, especially the sound effects. Whenever you move one of your planes you hear the associated propeller-driven engine noise. It even changes depending on damage or what maneuver you're attempting to pull off.\n\nThe music fits the game, although I turned it off. This wasn't because it was bad, but because I generally dislike background music in games.\n\nUnfortunately, your pilots' voices (the few times they speak) are sometimes weird or just plain buggy. One of my German pilots had a voice that sounded like someone had slowed down an old tape recording. It was amusing, but somewhat creepy at the same time.\n\nThe gameplay is standard turn-based fare, with some RPG elements tossed in. While in combat, your planes move over a hex-based battlefield, and have to keep an eye on their location. If they pass over an enemy base, for instance, anti-aircraft guns will fire at them. Fly into the clouds and you'll have temporary cover.\n\nYour position also determines when you can fire at the enemy and how much damage you can potentially do. Attacking an enemy from a higher altitude generally inflicts more damage on them, just as lining up shots while on their tail. Likewise, trying to attack an enemy while head-on or from a lower altitude does less damage and exposes you to return fire.\n\nThe RPG elements come into play by leveling up your pilots. They can gain rank and medals, including ace status. If you win missions and have less than 50% damage on any pilot, you gain a bonus that can be applied to any pilot. These bonuses improve weapons, flying, and armor.\n\nAfter a certain number of kills, each pilot gains a callsign, which denotes a  special ability, some of which are offensive and other defensive. Examples of offensive callsigns include "Deadeye" (long-range attack and better accuracy) or "Executioner" (potential to kill enemy during first attack) while some defensive callsigns are "Lucky" (anti-aircraft guns do no damage to you) or "Grease Monkey" (repairs plane faster).\n\nEach airplane also has its own stats, which gauge its speed, maneuverability, climbing rate, diving rate and hit points. Some planes have extra features, like a rear gunner or a machine gun mounted on the top of aircraft itself. These features let you shoot behind or up above you, when normally you could only shoot straight ahead.\n\nIf one of your pilots is shot down behind enemy lines, he'll be captured and become a prisoner of war. All prisoners are automatically exchanged every Christmas, although its possible for a pilot to escape. If your pilot was shot down within friendly territory, he'll be sent to the hospital and have to heal up before flying again. Finishing the mission with a severely damaged plane also necessitates repairs, which temporarily removes your pilot from active duty.\n\nAt the beginning of this review, I also noted that SMAP is unrealistic at times. How so? Well, for starters, you can play as one of four nations when playing a new game: American, British, French, and German. The problem with this is the campaign always begins in 1916, one year before the United States entered the war.\n\nIn addition, there are active-duty female combat pilots, when there were none at this time (or at least, none officially part of those four nations' armed forces). No pilots ever die, either. They can be captured or wounded, but that's it.\n\nOf a somewhat more minor nitpick in regards to realism, the ranking structure makes no sense at all, and fails to take into account each nation's differing ranks and language. I know this doesn't really make a difference in the game as rank is meaningless and imparts no benefits of any sort, but it's still annoying if you know better.\n\nSo... would I recommend this game? Yes, but only if you really like turn-based strategy, and the military and history inaccuracies won't drive you up the wall.","January 8, 2014","true","99.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Each side takes turns performing various maneuvers with a handful of aircraft from America, France, Germany and Britain. Most missions are simple, ranging from one on one ace combat, reconnaisance, bombing and zepplin attacks.\n\nPilots add another layer of strategy as they level up with successful kills. Each level allows the player to choose from three different sets of maneuvers for that specific pilot. Should the player keep damage levels above 50% in a scenario they will gain a part unlock to attach to a plane. This comes in the form of accuracy, damage, speed and maneuverability upgrades.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful game with high replayability.

Played it for 4 hours straight on a first install. Graphics are not high quality, but the gameplay does make up for that a lot. This game has got the Sid Meier's feel of gameplay all over it. A lot of tiny variables you need to account for before making a move. The only thing that bugged me is that there is no option for changing the resolution. The resolution is quite low. I guess that stems from the origin of this game. It was originally created for the iPhone. Apparently changing the resolution may be possible with a config.xml in your User's appdata folder (C:/Users/[yourusername]/AppData/Local/AcePilot/config.xml). I read that in the description of a youtube screencast here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdzyFdVxWA4  I did have the folder, but not the xml file. I am too lazy to write something on a trial and error basis or to send an email to the devs, so I am playing it really low res. If the gameplay rocks I do not care about the graphics so for me it is not an issue. I do not know if the devs will implement a possiblity for changing it. I bought the game on sale for €2,50 so it was a cheapy. I bought "Ace Patrol: Pacific Sky" also, but I will play that if I have finished this one. Highly recommended!","December 28, 2013","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every turn is an agonising choice as you choose between maneuvers. The game mechanic of trading altitude for speed and advanced maneuvers is breathtaking in its clarity, simplicity, and plausible authenticity.\n\nThe early days of air combat lead to a game of jousting and attack runs, both sides clawing for altitude and position, weaving in and out of clouds and flak zones, trying to line up a shot or trick the enemy into lining themselves up for another pilot's power dive kill shot. Taking to the air knowing you're facing a supremely skilled enemy Ace is a daunting prospect as he dances his bird across the sky, crossing your engagement lines in a lightning sprint and performing daring aerobatics to bring himself up into your squadron's six, but even the best pilot can find himself hard pressed if he lets himself get caught at low altitude, exhausted by constant high-gee flying.\n\nIt's a light, tight, satisfying game that shows its mobile roots on the surface but the underlying design shows an understanding of what makes a game work that dwarfs most AAA releases.","September 10, 2013","true","7.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/244070/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Ace Patrol can be best described as an WW1 air combat board game that are PERFECTLY adapted to the computer world. All the complex stuff is done by the computer. Your job is simply to choose the best moves that will bring you victory, by best utilitizing the capabilities of your men (and ahistorically, women) and your machines. That is tactical command done right.\n\nYou take command of a squadron of planes belonging to one of the four nations in WW1: US, Germany, UK, or France, and you choose four pilots. As your pilots gain kills, their skills will grow, giving them a wider repertoire of moves, as well as special ability, such as ability to escape from enemy prison, bonus damage when firing long-range, and so on.\n\nThe planes appear at historical times, which gives temporary advantage to one nation or another as technologies advance. Some planes have certain special capabilities that should be exploited, such as fast climb, high altitude capability, and so on.\n\nThe actual tactical maneuvers are your basic turns, climbs, dives, and so on. However, later advanced maneuvers such as "falling leaf" makes the plane impossible to target (or limiting damage by enemy gun pass), or gives you greater turn rate, allowing you to target or dodge more effectively.\n\nThe game is turn-based, which means one plane move at a time, all of yours, then all of theirs. All the "legal" moves are shown on the ground using blue icons, with green icons showing moves that will allow you to shoot at enemy planes. The one that does the most damage is the green icon with the green cross-hairs. However, it is NOT always the right move, as it may not get you away from a pursuing enemy, or let you line up for a subsequent attack on a different target.\n\nThe missions will often involve objectives such as bomber escort, ground attack, recon, and more. It is not just dogfights, although that's a lot of the game.\n\nOther factors that affect your air battles include cloud cover (diving into clouds to get away from enemies, but also reduces your maneuver choices) and ground anti-air guns (both enemy and friendly) which you can often expoit to your own advantage on your side of the border.\n\nThe campaign is a series of missions that you can choose from a list offered.\n\nAll in all, Ace Patrol is a fun little game that is surprising deep once you learn the intricasies, and at this cheap price (I paid a lot more when I first bought it) it's a must have. Each battle is only a few minutes long so save and enjoy it in small doses.","December 3, 2013","true","9.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

While its successor tackles WW2, this takes on WW1 where the strategy involves maneuvering your plane into the best possible position to shoot down the enemy. As you progress, nev maneuvers, planes and improvements become avaliable. The game is a casual one, but while you cannot expect much depth or complexity from it, you can expect it to be a fun pack-up-and-play game. And in all honesty, how many WW1 Air Combat TBS games are there out there? The originality of it alone deserves mention!\nAnother thing that should be mentioned is that your squadron will have female combat pilots. While I applaud the inclusion of female pilots on the principle of it being awesome, I am puzzled why Firaxis neglected to include an option to disable them for those that want to preserve some historical accuracy.\n\nPro:\n*Fun little TBS air-combat game.\n*Includes female pilots, yay!\n*Casual pick-up-and-play style.\n\nCon:\n*Lacking in depth and complexity.\n*No option to turn off female pilots for those wanting historical accuracy.\n*Not a lot of customization when it comes to graphics, etc.\n\nSummary:\nAce Patrol is worth its asking price, so long as you do not expect a great amount of depth, complexity or historical accuracy. That being said, it is a fun game set in a very interesting era of aviation! 5/10 -Recomended.\n\nFor more recomendations and reviews: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/strandedkerbonaut#curation","October 1, 2014","true","3.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

If you can look past the ugly mobile-phone-graphics it's a pretty deep game with plenty of strategy and tactics. Choose between several missions and complete the objectives using one or more (max 4) pilots. Make enough kills and your pilots will level up allowing them to use more/better maneuvers during battles. This can be critical later on in the game.\nYou'll also be able to unlock perks by completing secondary objectives. This, for example, allows crashed pilots to get right back into action after being captured by the enemy forces. And yes, better planes can also be unlocked.\nAce Patrol isn't a very long game and it's best played in short rounds, but like I said, it's good fun.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","October 6, 2013","true","5.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

A turn-based dogfighting game seemed a bit of a strange concept to me at first, and this game takes some getting used to, but it's actually quite fun so far.  It's proved to be harder than it seemed becasue there are so many moves the little planes can make (and I'm probably a lousy pilot too).  You also have to watch out for flak guns shooting up at you from the ground.  But as you gain victories and experience during the missions (strafing ground targets, shooting down balloons, dogfighting with enemy fighters, intercepting bombers, etc.) your pilots will get promoted and you can upgrade your aircraft.  I'm still learning the ropes, but it's an amusing little game so far.  Definitely worth buying, especially if it's on sale.

AGAIN I REPEAT DON'T BE PUT OFF BECAUSE GAME IS A PORT FROM THE IPHONE!\n\nNow that I have told you that, let me tell you why you need to get this game if you like taticle turb based strategy games such as Frozen Synapse where you attempt to get into the best situation possible so that you may obliterate your enemy, than this game is for you. Here are the basics. You control a squad of 4 WW1 airplanes. You do missions ranging from shoot down all enemy pilots to protect your recon plane. You must than issue orders to your pilots based on their abilites and manuvers to complete the mission. Use each of them to cover the other. Deal with altitude, cloud cover and evasion. In other words, the combat is deep and satisfying. Missions can take anywere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes depending on how you play and how risky or safe you play.\n\nHow much gameplay is there? I've played 3 hours so far, still British (which is the first nation you get to play as) and just started the 3rd level out of 5 (I believe) After that you get to pick the next nation you play as which has different mission types, locals and planes.\n\nThe graphics suit the game just fine, a bit cartoony but not over the top cartoony. The planes have nice modles as does the ground. But your not playing this game for the graphics, your playing this game for the combat. Again, think games like Frozen Synapse or Advanced Wars mixed with the Hex Based grid system of Civilization V mixed in with Altitude, upgradable manuvers, cloud cover and hours of fun and strategy.\n\nThe game never feels cheep when your plane is getting shot up. More than likely there was a way to forgo the situtation you are in, but you can undo turns, keep going and get your self out. Some missions only allow 1 pillot while others require all 4. But you have to manage your pilots. Each pilot has a different skill set of manuvers ranging from rolls, loops, ace moves and many more and even a special perk such as being able to shoot from farther away, copy all plane upgrades or escape from POW camps. So you have to look at the mission your going to do and pick the best pilot(s) for the job.\n\nThere's still so much that I didn't cover in this review because I havn't even touched the surface of this game. Am I filling this review full of BS and lies? No. This is all true and better than I can explain. Should you get this game? If you like deep tacticle strategy games, than yes.","February 7, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/244070/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nSid Meier's Ace Patrol is a Turn-based strategy game that uses small squad tactics with different types of planes as you fight through World War I. Sid Meier's Ace Patrol was developed by Firaxis Games and released in 2013.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  You know how World War I goes in your history classes? Yeah, pretty much the same story here. So instead of giving you your history class again, here's the basic gist that the story relevance to the video game follows: There are breakthrough in technology on both sides that give the Axis or the Allies a technological advantage over the other, you should take advantage of when these occur before the other side catches up and you're forced to rely on tactical maneuvers, again.\n\nGame Play: Sid Meier's Ace Patrol fills a unique strategy game "niche", this is the first game that I personally have played where it's all about flight combat tactics. Depending on different positions your planes will do more or less damage; if you're attacking from a flank or behind the enemy you'll do more damage. If you're firing while banking away you do less damage, or depending on the range you are from your enemy you might do greater or lesser damage.\n\nAchievements: The achievements generally require a great deal of commitment to first, learning the game mechanics, and then accomplishing successful campaigns with the different nations, earning ____ amount of victories as each respective nation, Victories with pilots, and defeating the harder difficulties. (this game is already plenty hard on easy difficulties by the way)\n\nPrice: Sid Meier's Ace Patrol is priced at $4.99, that's a fair price for the game, and for people who may find this game very enjoyable it's a great deal! Unfortunately this game will only appeal to certain gamers, most people won't grasp the subtle nuances or simply be pushed away because of the complexities of the game itself.\n\nConclusion: I recommend this game to people who already know they Enjoy strategy games. I suggest watching a few videos on how to play before making a final decision to purchase.

Its almost similar. And its cheap and fun as well.\n\nYou start of as one the pilot where you get to choose anyone of the four. And each one comes with a talent. As the mission progress, you have more pilots up to 4 and each pilots will gain different abilities where you can choose. Over the time and missions that you win and completed, your planes will be upgraded and modifications will be made to the plane where you can choose and also the different abilities like roll over, ace skills for your pilots.\n\nThis is a turn base battle where you will plan your planes flight to engage or complete the missions. Music is good, graphics pretty cute.\n\nOverall I find this quite fun, if you love some rpg, strategy and turnbase battle, try this one out you will be surprise what you find in this game, not for hardcore strategy lovers. More fore casual or some rpy strategy lovers. Besides its battle of the world war 2 planes.\n\n8/10 (Some role playing elements and strategy combination and user friendly controls make it a hit)\n\n\n","March 4, 2014","true","5.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is *not* "Civilisation with planes" or anything close; people who saw Sid Meiers name and came here looking for another long strategy full of management and compelling player to play "one more turn" before quiting are in wrong place.  Ace Patrol campaign is more a series of scenarions each about 15 minutes long, connected by campaign mechanism just complex enough to give sense of continuity. It is not a faithful representation of WW I, either, but I'd say more faithful than not :).\n\nThe Good: The game mechanics make sound representation of planes behaviour in the air; most of tactics and moves you need to win would make sense in historical fights (if not always between planes presented). You don't have feeling that you are playing abstract board game that uses plane icons to represent pieces. Despite it being a turn game, the feeling of movement is always present. I'd even say I've learned a thing or two about Boom and Zoom tactics when playing  a squadron of SPADs against Dreideckers - knowing it needs patience and discipline from pilot is one thing, seeing how many turns it takes in turn game is quite another. The short but satisfying scenarios mean you won't spend long hours over this game, at least not continously, but makes it good game for short breaks while doing other things, especially office procrastination :) . It does not mean it can't be played for hours - happened to me - but you don't need hours of free time to play it.\n\nThe Bad: While the way game represents the planes characteristics and behaviour in the air is mostly sound, putting the roll rate and sustained turn rate in single "maneuvrability" stat (which seem to govern how easily plane changes direction, IE roll rate) leads to some breaks from realism. For instance, the way to defeat Albatros with "maneuvrable" Sopwith Camel is not to outturn it, but to outscissor it - historically, it might be the best way to snach a defeat from maw of victory :). It's still a possible situation between two different planes and Ace Patrol is a board game that is not supposed to be realistic, but it still ruins the immersion.\n\nThe Ugly: Each of four featured nations (Frenchm Britons, Americans and Germans) has choice od six plane types to fly, and the way planes have been chosen is idiosyncratic to say the least. The decision to shoehorn Americans (who skipped most of tech race of 1916-1918 and did not have own early plane types) as full-blown faction is probably to blame here; we have French flying planes they designed but never used (Hanriot HD.1, Nieuport.28) , Americans flying iconic French and British planes they barely used (SPAD 7, Sopwith Triplane, Sopwith Strutter - to add insult to injury, N.28 was widley used by Americans while french made more use of Triplane than Americans). Thanks to campaign mechanics, sometimes we see unhistorical fights like F.kker Eindeckers vs Bristol Fighter. It still makes a fun game, but much less immersive than it could be.","March 20, 2014","true","23.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You can customise your first pilot's voice and portrait who will go on the first mission. Each pilot command their own plane. As you progress through the game you can unlock new planes, which each have varying stats. Your pilots will also level up during the game. As they do you can select an ability for them to learn which varies between their movement during play. If you meet certain requirements, you can unlock perks for pilots after each mission which includes improving accuracy and defence. Each plane has a set amount of health. When your pilots get shot down, they remain unavailable in later missions until they are released. Injured pilots may also be unavailable in later missions as well. You get to choose different mission types in campaign:  defence and attack. In defence missions, you basically have to defend a certain building or units from being destroyed by the enemy. In attack missions, you need to bomb/destroy a particular building or unit. As you win one country's campaign you unlock another one (you start off with playing as the British)\n\nCombat is turn based. You generally select your units and move them on the highlited pads. Certain pads may glow red, indicating that you will shoot at the enemy plane when you move there. You will be provided with the amount of damage you will do to the enemy plane. Furthermore, you can only shoot at plane from the front and to the side only, so you need to turn around if enmy planes are behind you.\n\nThere isn't much music to this game. The title screen music is like classical 'Civ' games, but there is no tracks during gameplay. Your pilots may say a few words, but they are forgettable anyway.\n\n\nIf you enjoy basic civ game which only focuses on unit combat then you may like this game. If your expecting a 'civilisation' game, you will DEFINATELY be dissapointed.\n","February 8, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As you increase the difficulty the challenge really does ramp up and you will need to plan what manueveres to upgrade your pilots with and understand how and when to use them, it becomes like a chess game.\n\nThe set up of the game is that your participate in 5 battles, and there are 5 engagements within each battle. They are literally just randomly generated engagements based off the same 4 engagement types - Combat Air Patrol, Search & Destroy, Recon or Escort. However you can choose from one of 3 engagements offered, this means you can choose to challenge yourself or avoid doing that one engagement type that you've become bored of.

Ace Patrol is a nice game, all in all. Not worth a lot of money, so buy it during Steam Sale. I say it's not worth a lot of money because Sid Meier could have done better.\n\nPROS:\n- The maneuvers and the differences between the planes literally give the player a lot of room to play. Knowing your planes and those of your enemy is important in using your maneuvers effectively, especially with higher difficulty settings.\n- Gameplay is quite straightforward.\n\nCONS:\n- The graphics are a bit childish for the most part.\n- Too arcadish. Don't expect me to care about the life of my pilots when some of them have these silly faces. Don't include female pilots. I don't care about political correctness.\n- Lack of strategical decision-making. You can choose between 3 missions, select some pilots and upgrade them. You don't really have influence on a strategical level.\n- Don't play for too long, it could get a bit repetitive. That said, it's not really a con.\n\nSo, the game is okay, but as soon as there is a game like this that is historically more accurate, graphically more attractive and strategically more challenging I will probably never play Sid Meier's Ace Patrol again.","June 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Each pilot who comes back gains experience which can be used to upgrade their planes and most importantly, with new ariel maneuvers. The core of this game is all movement and positioning. First time I've seen movement be such a core mechanic in a turn based game.\n\nVery clever and to me, very original. If you like turn based tactical combat and want something different that hints at true strategic depth this game is definitely worth a purchase.\n\nHighly recommended.","September 25, 2015","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Spitfire. Ace Patrol does look a bit like those games, but with more colorful/kid-friendly approach.  After a few hours of gameplay I can honestly say, It's not even close to level of grand those aformentioned games represented.\n\nAce Patrol feels like a mobile game (and it is a mobile game too). Gameplay is a mostly fun, turn-based dogfighting with light rpg elements. Scale is a first dissapointment -  you won't command more than 4 planes at once. Most of the time, missions involve two or three of your pilots. That's just sad - no chance for grand strategy battles. Rpg elements are barebones. There's no real way to customize your pilots - you just make them better and add new skills. The same with new planes - every time you get a new one, it's better then the previous.  If you hope for a long campaign - you can finish all missions (diveded into 6 offensives) in around 2h. Single mission takes around 5-10 minutes to be completed.  Offcourse the main goal of the game is to win the war on the highest difficulty setting, but most of us, will be perfectly happy with medium. Ace Patrol can be punishing at times. You are not obliged to win every mission, but failures will cost you.... points. Yes, it seems that Ace Patrol is more of a score attack game. Sure, shot down pilots will end up in hospital for a while or be captured and put into POW camp for the rest of the offensive. Also, failing missions will change the final outcome of the offensive. Nevertheless, it's all about your final score, not about ranking up your pilots or enjoyable mission objectives.\nAfter finishing the game with one of the factions, I'm not really interested in playing it again. Factions don't really differ from one another,  so replaying the game as Americans or French changes nothing. Also, i don't think there's enough variety in mission objectives or rpg elements. It's just so basic and bare-bones.\n\nTL,DR :\nAce Patrol is perfect game for "so-so" score. Middle grade. There is no "mild recomendation" in Steam Reviews. Yes, i would recommend it. I was pretty negative, but it's fun little game, for a 3 or 4h. It was a nice distraction, opened in a small window, on my work computer - just to finish a mission between sending emails and making phone calls.

Although I like Borderlands, this is not very good customer service.\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nUpdate: I have another desktop with i7 and discrete AMD graphics card.  On this PC, both games ran without any problems.  I am still disappointed by the fact it doesn't run on my laptop w/Intel graphics.  This is a strategy game with less than 150MB in size from a reputable developer / publisher.  I didn't have this kind of problem from many indie titles I own.","January 6, 2014","false","2.6"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","1"

It is important to keep in mind that this is a casual game. The gameplay is not especially deep or complicated, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is easy to pick up and play through a few quick missions if you don’t want to get sucked into a full-blown, drawn-out strategy game like Civilization V or XCOM. (Not to say that the gameplay of Ace Patrol isn't incredibly addictive, because it is.)\n\nMissions take just a few minutes to complete, and there are roughly twenty-four missions per campaign (There is one campaign for each of the four playable nations). During a mission, you maneuver your little squadron around the playing field to complete the objective, be it shooting down enemy aircraft, destroying supply convoys or escorting reconnaissance planes. But it isn’t enough to simply shoot down other planes as quickly as possible by selecting the move that gives the most damage… doing so might put your plane directly into the enemies' line of fire. Instead, you will need to decide the best course of action of how to destroy the enemy planes and still bring your guys back (relatively) undamaged.\n\nAce Patrol is quite fun, however, there are a couple of downsides. The graphics are so-so (I find they have their charm). And even though there are “campaigns”, there is no storyline or narrative, which is a bit disappointing. You level up your pilots, add upgrades to your planes, fly out on a mission, come back to base and repeat, so you never really feel a sense of purpose or connection to your pilots. At the very least, it would have been nice to see a few historical fun facts or something. And because there are a limited number of mission types, eventually you may find yourself flying the same missions with only different configurations of clouds and friendly/enemy territory.\n\nIf you are looking for a pick-up-and-go casual game to play every now-and-then or a “light” strategy game that does not take hours to beat, I highly recommend giving Ace Patrol a try. Although it lacks the scope of other turn-based strategy games, there is still great potential for “just one more mission!”","December 11, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
