The concept really grabbed me. I love wizards and the idea of a game that could really let you cut loose and let you wreck havoc with its entire focus put on making you feel like a mighty wizard among mortals seemed like exactly what I was looking for. Unfortunately, you'll quickly find that the game's definition of "badass wizard" is extremely narrow, and even worse, they really don't deliver.\n\nThe game brags having thousands of spells, and while that may be technically true, it rings hollow. Spells are crafted by combining elements that you unlock through the story and spell modifiers that drop as loot, so you have potentially infinite combinations on paper. The result however is that you have 3 spell types with a million permutations that only change a few decimal points are on the numbers that pop up. Elements are meaningless, just pick what particle effect you want on your projectiles. If you were expecting some real magic, like summoning dogs, lighting them on fire and throwing them at your enemies, you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nThe gameplay is where things really grind down though. The levels are just corridors a mile long with the only interaction being busting up the game's equivalent of decorative vases. The enemies are mindless and predictable, and so is fighting them. You walk into a clearing, combat music plays, a bunch of skeletons pop up out of the ground, walk backwards and throw ice/fire/lighting balls at them until dead. As said before you only have 3 real spells. A basic fireball in whatever flavor of particle effect have on, an AOE attack/bomb in whatever flavor particle effect you have on, and a block that does damage if you time it right. In whatever flavor particle effect you have on. The enemies have little variation either. Melee guy that runs up and slaps you, ranged guy that throws ♥♥♥♥ at you, and sometimes theres a ghost that floats around and freezes you. Expect to see groups of about 8 of them pop up every 15 feet, about 30 times a level. No puzzles, no talking and investigating, just walking from one fight to another. The game promises dungeons and quests made specifically for a wizard, unhindered by needing to allow warriors or barbarians through, and all I could think while playing it was how much more satisfying it would be bashing skeletons to pieces with a hammer than dealing with the game's slow clunky combat casting.\n\nThe gameplay honestly just feels like skyrim's magic. Hold down button to charge fireball/aoe, point at enemy. Except in Skyrim you could dual wield magic. And you could summon creatures. And you could cast enchantments on yourself. And you could summon magic weapons and slash and smash enemies if you wanted. And there were more than 3 kinds of spells. And And And. The list goes on. When a game focused soley and entirely on one thing can't even do that thing better than a game that really only includes that thing in an ancilliary manner, you've got a real problem. Skyrim is NOT the best game to experience being a wizard, yet Lichdom has chosen to emulate its combat system more closely than any other game I can think of, puts its entire focus on that one aspect, and frankly only improves on it by a degree of maybe like, what %5? If that? But guess what, skyrim isn't 40 bucks, and it's got an entire everything else going for it.\n\nLichdom has some things going for it, it looks good and It's got a good working loot system. It's not painful to play or anything, but it isn't great, and above all else, it's not what it promises to be. It doesn't make you feel like you're an almighty wizard any more than sweepng the driveway will make you feel like a bulldozer.\n\nTldr: lichdom falls short of everything promised. Weak magic, repetitive gameplay, tiny scope. If you want to feel like a real unstoppable wizard, play morrowind and craft fireballs the size of cities. If you want frantic action with an interesting spell casting system and cathartic blow stuff up fun, play magicka and trap your friends in bubbles full of landmines and zombies.","August 29, 2014","false","4.6"," 2,793 of 3,255 people (86%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","86","793","3","27","132"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/261760/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Usually when I write up a game, I start with all the good points and then transition to the bad stuff. I feel like this makes for a more positive reading experience overall, and should make my impression of it whole and clear by the end. I'm not going to do that this time, because the first thing you need to know about Lichdom is that it is too damn long. Now, this is not "the new Shadow Warrior is too damn long" or "the Hobbit trilogy was too damn long" or "presidential primary season is too damn long". This is an entirely new paradigm of too damn long, and you really need to understand this before even considering this game. My first playthrough took 22 hours. That's certainly long for an FPS, and short for some other genres with a little overlap here, but those 22 hours were stretched over eight levels. That's it! Furthermore, those eight levels play more like five, because three of them are continuations of the previous level. There's a lost city level, two ice levels, two desert levels, two swamp levels, and a proper city level. With each of those lasting 2-3 hours, you're going to be wandering through huge stretches of glacier and sand and muck.\n\nBut what really makes this game feel like it takes forever is the level design itself. Lichdom is constructed in the vein of an arena shooter, much like Shadow Warrior or Bulletstorm. Hallways lead to conspicuous arenas where you fight whatever spawns in, after which you take another hallway to another arena and so on and so forth. There are no puzzles, no doors, no interactables, almost no alternate paths, and very little reason to explore off the main trail. There are some side fights and usually one or two secret dungeons that can get you valuable piles of spell components, but in terms of gameplay you're just getting harder versions of the fights you're doing normally. So yes, the cardinal sin of this game is that it is 20+ hours of the same damn thing. What you get in the first two hours is what you're going to get times ten, with arguably even less variety as you progress.\n\nStill with me? Good, because if you can get past that admittedly enormous flaw, there's a pretty great game in here. The whole reason to play Lichdom is to make good on the whole BADASS MAGE thing, and the magic system delivers. Instead of guns or swords, you fight solely with magic that you can customize to an impressive degree. Over the course of the game you unlock eight sigils, which are elements like fire and ice but also more curious concepts like corruption and delirium, and you can have three equipped and ready to use at any given time. Each sigil has three spells attached to it for you to use. There's a targeted spell that can be built as a homing missile, a bomb you lob, or a channeled beam. There's an AoE spell that can be an explosion, a pool, or a trap that must be triggered. And there's a nova that has conditions for triggering it depending on your shield (more on shields later). On top of that, you can determine the EFFECT of each spell, either direct damage, a status effect, or a damage multiplier, which also varies in its function by sigil. Fire spells can knock down and burn over time, lightning spells can stun and chain across enemies, delirium spells can mind control and make enemies flee, and so on.\n\nAnd honestly, that's just the basics. Spells can critically hit for additional effects, or be charged before casting for a guaranteed crit. Charged spells can do a special crits charmingly named "apocalypticals" which give you a bonus effect based on the inflicting sigil. You can craft special synergy spells that use two sigils instead of one and have awesome room-clearing effects like collapsing black holes or summoning exploding zombies or conjuring a hurricane. You also build a shield spell for yourself that represents your hit points and determines additional abilities like teleporting and blocking. Spells are crafted out of Diablo-style loot drops from enemies and chests, color-coded by rarity (white-green-blue-purple-orange-red, of course). These components can be combined up to higher grades, disassembled for specific parts, or gambled away for a chance at rare components. If this sounds overwhelming, there's a Smart Inventory option that will upgrade your spells and combine up your components for you. Honestly though, if you're not in it to ♥♥♥♥♥ out over your spells, you're missing a huge part of the game. You've got a ton of control over your arsenal, and experimentation is incredibly fun with the enormous range of effects and combinations your can produce.\n\nAs hard as I slagged the level design, I have to say they are pleasing to progress through. The CryEngine makes for some gorgeous scenery, and a lot of love went into rendering the battlegrounds and cesspools you traverse. The levels themselves can be pretty creative, even if their layout is not. The third level is particularly impressive once you figure out what it is. While there is a lot of detail, it's worth mentioning that there are no destructables or physics objects. This felt particularly disappointing while slinging around devastating spells, even if the spell effects themselves are meaty and satisfying. There's a pretty good variety of enemies as well, or at least there would be for a shorter game. About half are introduced early on and the rest are slowly sprinkled in so there is some variety to the battles, even if you're going to be fighting every possible combination of foe at least twice.\n\nThe story is nothing special, classic fantasy revenge story, but the voice acting is pretty great. You get to play as Troy Baker or Jennifer Hale, and whichever one you don't pick becomes your NPC traveling buddy. And let me tell you, they are some clever, snippy jackasses. The other characters mostly talk like Tolkien characters but these two love cursing and quipping at each other and everything in a perfectly charming way. Your mentor figure is Clancy Brown (swarthy Lex Luthor from the Superman cartoons!), and the villains and side characters all turn in quality performances as well. I will say that the plot does something dumb in the swamp levels that cuts into the voice acting fun quite a bit, but by that point you're probably just trying to power through to the end. There are some pretty good and challenging boss battles, and the New Game Plus mode if you manage to beat the game is great for dicking around and tricking out your mage; it's a big series of challenge portals with different randomized fights and scaling difficulty.\n\nSo there you go, a writeup almost as long and meandering as the game itself. I've certainly gotten a lot of enjoyment out of it, chiefly because the spellcrafting and combat are excellent and the presentation is fantastic. But even I was getting sick of the game by the ten-hour mark, and that wasn't even halfway. I really pushed myself to finish it, and I'm glad I did, and I still kinda want to play it now and then. It's just important to know what you're getting into, and prepare for a lot of monotony if you want to get to the meat of the game. Pick it up on sale like I did ($5 is a steal for a game of this quality, at least!) and give the first level a try, and if you're cool with that for another 20 hours, enjoy depopulating a faraway kingdom with fire and locusts and zombies and time rifts.

Then they went and changed a ton of minor (but very important mechanics in the game, like how often you get upgrades. Which was decent in beta, now with release its almost never). They also did a major overhall on the ability to dodge enemies (unlimited unless you limited yourself but got other boosts, now it is 3 dodges max, with a long long cooldown). I had 10 hours in the beta and loved the game, just played an hour of official release and I just cant bother. Their whole thing about making mages seem strong was completely destroyed with the official release, and like many games (as a mage) with every encounter I am spending atleast 2/3 of my time running away and less than 1/3 attacking. Which frankly makes me feel against like any old squishy mage, and you might as well just throw in a mana bar that regenerates over time because its comes out to the same thing, if you dont spend most of your time running way you just straight up die before you can cast enough spells to kill anything beyond the weakest of the weak enemies. I seriously cant believe how much they destroyed their main selling point when they went from beta to release.","August 29, 2014","false","23.5"," 631 of 818 people (77%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","77","631","818","5","14"

You are a mage. You have great power. You have no responsibility.\n\nI have one huge gripe with this game and it's that nothing is explained, which makes the crafting system a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nI had spells with 10 different variables listed on them. After playing through the game thrice I only understand HALF of them.\n\nI'm not even kidding.\n\nLuckily, you don't have to understand the chemistry of flammable materials in order to pull a trigger and the spells work just fine even if you don't know wtf you're even doing.\n\nJust find a combo that gets the job done, and stick with it.\n\nFor example, after skimming tutorials on crafting I made a build that allowed me to debuff my enemies, freeze them in place, set them on fire, explode them into bloody chunks, STOP TIME FOR 5 SECONDS, and then kill all their friends.\n\nThis pleases me.\n\nOn my second playthrough I made a build which involved infecting my enemies with the eggs of stinging insects, waiting for the eggs to 'mature' and then killing the first enemy, which freed the insects to attack the second enemy, which then spawned more insects to attack the next enemy...and so on.\n\nThis self-perpetuating insect cascade scoured the board clear of anything that irked me.\n\nAnd if anything survived I electrocuted it to death.\n\nAnd don't get me started on the kamikaze ghoul you can summon who breathlessly chuckles at you while he searches for enemies to blow himself up against.\n\n"Huehuehuehue.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jendar-nox/recommended/261760/","jendar-nox","Jendar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jendar-nox/","106 products in account","I admire this concept. I was excited by it when I first read the description of Lichdom somewhere on the Internet. World certainly lacked a game where you could really feel like a mage, casting endless spells and wreaking mayhem around yourself.\n\nYou even feel wrong while playing it, because until now, in any other game, this kind of gameplay has only been available through cheating. You are basically immortal (in case of "death" you actually just despawn and spawn back at the nearest checkpoint), you have an abyss of magical energy that never exhausts, and you can just keep throwing orbs of fire at your enemy until it dies. Overall, it's all you could only dream of if you ever chose to be a mage in an RPG. Do you remember how you had to sleep in order to restore your mana after killing every_single_enemy in Morrowind? Feels like nightmare now.\n\nLichdom makes use of the old principle of making magic that you could find in certain games in the past. You need to 'craft' spells by means of combining certain elements: the basic source (like fire), shaper (like projectile) and effect caused (like damage). Shapers and effects have several levels of strength and can be upgraded to improve them. The crafting system is tricky: a lot depends upon your ability to analyze the spell components, understand the way they work, and pick up those that would make the spell the most efficient. Thus, your work on the spells should be scrupulous and meticulous. Certain people fail to understand that, and it's rather funny to see them complaining that enemies are too strong, spells are too weak, and they can't just come through the whole game with one set of spells they created at the very beginning.\n\nSpeaking of which, you can have 3 sets of spells at hand, each set consisting of a single-target spell, a multiple-target spell and a protective spell. Personally I could use more creativity and variability in both crafting and management of spells: you can't combine two different kinds of shapers or effects, for example, or have two single-target spells in one set. Still, I think it's fine the way it is.\n\nPeople criticize Lichdom for making promises about thousands of possible spells that come out to be not entirely true. There's a bit of marketing manipulation in that, indeed; it would have been more technically correct to speak of hundreds than of thousands. The arithmetics is as follows: 3 types of spells - 3 ways to attune them - 7 main types of shaping - 8 basic sources; that's 504 in total. Also, unique and extra-strong synergy spells can exist between the basic sources, adding another 49. The rest of spell variability resides upon random modifications that come up with certain shapers and effects: damage boosts, projectile speed increasers, critical hit chance multipliers etc.\n\nI have also seen a number of reviewers who believed that basic sources ("sigils" by in-game terminology) are all the same and only change the color of projectiles you cast. That's basically a bitter mistake of people who saw the first three sigils and decided that they've seen them all. I feel pity for them, because they will never know that you can hang your opponents in the air and smash them into the ground, summon an army of creatures to assist you, slow the time down, control the minds of your enemies, create black holes that tear them apart, cast meteor showers or whirlwinds of fire and ice etc. Also, each sigil is suited for a certain purpose, so by means of careful and skilled attunement you can create incredibly powerful spells. What do you think of killing the main endgame boss with all his monstrous health in a couple of minutes?\n\nCryEngine obviously is not designed for open-world games, so this game has a strong resemblance to a first-person shooter where you just follow a wide but still limited passageway. I would have preferred a greater freedom of exploration and probably some other things that might make Lichdom more Skyrimey as well; but maybe it's not that bad, because you have enough trouble dealing with all those shapers and augments to care about grabbing loot or running around with a map.\n\nThere's also been a lot of criticism for repetitive gameplay. As one person had said, "you just travel from one pack of enemies to another". The trick is that Lichdom is a shooter (as I've just said), and any shooter can be called repetitive. Games of that genre are played for the action and for the process of killing enemies standing in your way. Take Crysis 2 or 3, that are built upon the same engine, as an example. Can't you say that it's travelling from one bunch of CELL soldiers or cephalopods to another? Meh, you can even call Half-Life repetitive: "oh come on, kill some headcrabs - solve a puzzle, kill some zombies - solve a puzzle, repeat ad nauseam".\n\nI won't be saying anything about graphics here, because again, it's CryEngine. You know what I mean.\n\nYou can choose whether you'll play with a male or a female, but there are no editing options for the character. That's not a big problem, because the game doesn't have a third-person view, so you won't really get a lot of chances to enjoy their exterior. I enjoy the female character's voice instead; it's quite nice, and it reminds me of Commander Shepard.\n\nI've said about things I liked and things I'm fine with, now I'll say what troubles me.\n\nThe game is still slightly buggy. It's not critical, it won't crash, freeze, or make you lose your progress, but there might be minor issues like character starting to move automatically in one direction with no way to stop it except for exiting to game menu and loading the game again, or birds hanging in mid-air after they were supposed to fly away. It's a new release, though, and probably these things will be dealt with in future.\n\nIt also seems to me that spells and their effects are not that action-like. It's a common trouble in many games, and it partially exists in Lichdom too. What happens if a fireball impacts an enemy and explodes? Yes, your guess was right: the enemy continues to run at you without even losing a step. This is a fireball, after all; it should knock the enemy off its feet and bump it into the nearby wall. If you decide to use a lightning projectile, be ready that your character will cast a slowly flying orb of electricity instead of a flashing lightning bolt. I'd like to see a swifter and more explosive gameplay. Maybe it's a matter of personal taste, though.\n\nSo,\nthe primary positive feature of Lichdom is its concept to unshackle the mage,\nand the primary negative feature of it is that I do not actually feel badass. I feel cool, but not badass.\n\nIn general, I like this game, and I support it. To me, its virtues outweigh its drawbacks. If you like the idea behind it as much as I do, if you ever dreamed of limitless magical power, then don't hesitate and get it - it won't disappoint you.","August 28, 2014","true","44.2"," 363 of 483 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","363","483","0","4"

Well, yes, that's correct.\nFirst of all you have to manage to reach the end. It's a rather long game, some of the levels are huge and seem like they will never end at all. Then there is the difficulty, this game can be freaking hard! Unless you shift down to casual mode you will die plenty of times. And then there are the achievements, which I enjoy hunting, so all in all it took some time to find my verdict.\n\nThe reviews and articles about this game like to mention the word 'bad-♥♥♥ mage'. Well, there might be some bad-♥♥♥ in this game but it's definitely not you or me. And even if you reach the highest tiers in all you magic abilities you still won't be the bad-♥♥♥ you dreamed of. Besides, it is very unlikely that you will reach level 20 of any of your ability by a one time play-though. But luckily the game lets you continue progressing your abilities and strengths after reaching the end of the game. You even have the chance to move back in the levels you have already played, just this time there are more enemies and they are much stronger than before. Your masochistic attitude will define if you are going to like this or rather not.\n\nSo did I have fun?\nWell, yes, I had some fun, but not enough to make me recommend this game.\nLet's have a look at the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- nice graphics\n- fighting is fun and looks very cool\n- after too many gamer complaints the developers added an automated spell crafting system (that works but always keeps you wondering if a spell could not have been done better)\n- developers added some extra levels called portals to keep you playing after you finished the game\n- five difficulty settings. So why is this a good thing? Because there was only one difficulty level before player complaints\n\nCons:\n\n- cry engine 3, it's going to cost you if you want to enjoy this game in full details in full HD without stuttering\n- the story is boring, to be frank, I could not care less\n- the only two things you can do in this game is fighting or redefining and upgrading your spells. Fighting makes you gain accessories for spells.\n- fighting becomes too repetitive\nspell-crafting is a pain in the ♥♥♥, I still don't really understand it in full detail\n- no manual (yes, you will painfully miss it and you will find yourself searching the net for clues on spell-crafting, trust me)\n- limited range of enemies that almost stays the same group of foes from the beginning to the end of the game\n- very linear level design\n- boss fights are rather tiring than existing\n- some actions make you loose some of all your progress in spell crafting. Like when you switch to 'bad-♥♥♥' difficulty all spell crafting experience for all spells not equipped is reset to level 1. Is this bad? Yes, this is bad !!!\n- the game can be very frustrating if you play on medium difficulty or higher\n\nSince I like to collect achievements I kept playing after finishing the main game. That's why I ended up with 38 hours play time. But would I recommend this game to a friend? No, sorry, just can't do that!\n\nIf it's on sale for like 5 bucks or less I think it's OK to buy the game but do not expect too much. My  expectations where high. Maybe that's why I was somewhat disappointed. The bad things in this game simply outnumber the good things and that's what leaded to my verdict. In terms of gaming magazine ranking my verdict would be around 60 for this game.\n\nDo I regret playing Lichdom Battlemage?\nNot really, but I am more than happy to leave it behind.\n\n","January 21, 2015","false","38.9"," 229 of 303 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","229","303","8","0"

I should've waited for more reviews. The following are the reasons why I do NOT recommend this game to anyone.\n\n1: I have been a RPG fan for the majority of my life, and I can tell you: This is not a RPG. Consider Serious Sam, only instead of bullets you shoot magic.\n\nThere is no strong story line, no character development, no sensible balance between physical-magical abilities and no items. Just mindless hack and slash from area to area without any rhyme or reason.\n\nMost notably, there is no discoveries or adventure, which is perhaps the most notable aspect of any good RPG.\n\n2: The premise of magic is abhorrently wrong. One can clearly sense that the developers had some system of magic like Skyrim in mind, and thought: "Hey, wouldn't it be cool if the hero had no limitations like mana etc?".\n\nThe result is just bizarre. You can only have 1 spell equipped at any time, there is no artistic way of combining them together: Simply hack and slash, just with magic.\n\nEven Dragon Age 2 got it better than this, of course far far better. Not to mention games like Path of Exile which have a clearly different and much better progress.\n\n3: The diffidently spikes are extremely annoying. You have 3 shields, if you lose them, you die and have to start from the checkpoint. Easy? Nope:\n- "I just wanna be a tanky mage with lots of AOE!"\n- "No can do sonny, now dodge, dodge, DODGE! RUN!

It was lovely fun to use new things to destroy every foe.\n\nBut a few chapters in, it became super annoying, repetitive, and even boring. eventually you settle on whatever best combo you have to take out enemies and constantly use it. sure you can make new moves with different powers but that takes time and more and more sygils, why bother when you have a set that already works? Even with a working killing combo (IE set fire to foes, levetate them, put them in stasis bubble then use killing blow for x20 damage) you still get smacked and pelted around by random guys all over the room who are out of your FOV. Some enemies put shields around the ones your killing, ruining the combo, which is fine thats gameplay but it constantly disrupts the flow, as does being knocked down, just feeling ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and aggrivating.\n\nAnd to top off the feeling of battle, if you don't charge abilities (holding down a mouse button till it pings) you do little to no damage, elongating an already cumbersome fight. The only way to really take down enemies is fast and hard, comboing mastery stacks, then hitting at the end. but to do that you must charge EVERY SINGLE MOVE into a super critical, and holy crap its so boring to just charge over and over and over and then be sometimes knocked over during this by the enemy.\n\nFlow is another thing, this game has awful pacing. its battle battle battle, listen to some guy talk for about 12 seconds, battle battle battle battle. I can't even finish the game I feel utterly bored and bothered.\n\nGive it a looksie, its a pretty game, and it has some great ideas. I just personally am fed up enough to uninstall it right now. I'd rather go play almost anything else right now.","March 11, 2015","false","28.0"," 90 of 114 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","90","114","3","3"

I bought it the moment it came out, and I don't regret it. If you read the negative comments, they mostly focus on 3 things, 1) Too hard, 2) Spell making isn't great, or 3) too repetitive.\n\nWell, It's hard. There are boss fights and even mini boss fights which I will slam my head against for hours. If you don't like a challenge, don't play. This game wasn't meant to be a stroll through the park, it was meant to really challenge a mage-type character. I enjoy difficulty, so I enjoy this game.\n\nThe spell making is much more than what the negative comments would make you think. Yes, there are only three basic types of spells (Area, Target, Nova). However, there are multiple types of each spell. For example, targeted spells can be rays, missiles, a lobbed bomb, etc. Then, once you've chosen the type of spell, and it's category, you can choose modifiers. You can go for super fast, super destructive, crowd control, etc. AND that's not even all. Don't forget the sigils, each sigil is a different type of magic with different effects and usages. To top it off, when you're crafting spells, the most powerfull spells use two sigils, and that mixture brings epic destruction.  There is plenty of spell variety if you're looking for it.\n\nNo, it is not repetitive. There is quite a bit of grinding, I won't deny that, but that is only due to how difficult the boss fights can get. The more you kill the more spell components you get, the better spells you can craft, the more powerful you become. When you get to boss fights, different bosses require different strategies. Some you have to cc and kill quickly, others you have to dodge and run and hit hard when you can. Some bosses you have to walk right up to them and just hit them non-stop until they slam into the ground and explode (It looks awesome).\n\np.s. I forgot to mention when it comes to spells, there are also sheilds.","April 27, 2015","true","32.3"," 63 of 75 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","63","75","3","0"

First, the impact of magic is badass. When you play, particularly when using fire spells, the first thing you will notice is that the impact of spells is unlike any other game out there. Embers shoot off of enemies, and there is even a nice touch where nearby foliage can be scorched. I adjusted my graphics preset to medium and am happy to report that there seems to be very little loss of visual fidelity while at the same time a noticeable increase in performance. I still wish there were more advanced options, and choosing a preset is definitely favorable to customizing your options, as it will often result in worse performance.\n\nI maintain that the level design is very linear, however, there are branching paths. Upon starting a new game I was able to experience a rather engaging mini-boss fight that I did not see before. As for being able to run past enemies, it is not as severe of a problem as I initially thought. Enemy AI is fairly competent (ranged enemies keep their distance and even take cover from spells while melee enemies rush you as expected), however, the problem seems to be that enemies are tethered to certain areas. This is fixed in a few areas, like the boss arena, that require you to jump into an arena, however the problem still persists in many places. I would like to see enemies be able to follow you wherever you go and maybe even a new enemy type that can outrun the player.\n\nAnimations are very high quality. Incinerating skeletons and watching their burning forms recoil and slump to the ground is satisfying, and all the enemies move and attack in realistic ways.\n\nI still think that the slow motion dodge (though extremely cool) is a bit too powerful, though I definitely see the merits of ranged combat now that I have to deal with the pesky archers. If anything, AOE attacks seem underpowered considering they take longer to charge up than any other attack and are used for close range, a situation where the dodge move would most likely be far more effective and easy. I'm sure there will be plenty of balancing, though.\n\nSo yes, I definitely recommend buying this game right now. This build is very solid as far as pre-alphas go and if I were you I would definitely grab it for the discounted price now.\n\n****End Edit\n\nFrom what I've played so far, I can say it is alright, especially for pre-alpha.\n\nThere are not a lot of spells that are available right now, but I'm sure they will be added later. First the things I don't like:\n\n-Sluggish movement\n-No jumping\n-Lack of crosshairs and ambiguous UI\n-Problems with dialogue being voiced (don't know if voices are integrated yet or this is my problem) and some artifacting problems\n\nMy biggest concern, however, is the level design. I was able to beat the entire game (thus far) by simply running past enemies and then later spamming the slow motion move that burns/ices a path. Very disappointing. Spellcasting right now simply isn't that fun. Most enemies rush you and certain spells are FAR more useful than others. The basic projectile spells pale in comparison to your slow-mo and AOE attacks, but take a similar amount of time to charge.\n\nI can say that the game does look pretty good, particularly in the lighting department, though it is not perfectly optimized yet. Again, I will require some more playthroughs. As of right now I have run through the first mission and about half of the second one. The story is fairly nonsensical, unfortunately. It looks like effort is being put into it, though, so maybe more context will be established in the future. Right now it is DEFINITELY pre-alpha. As long as some of the balancing problems are fixed, the game is optimized a bit better (and we are given some advanced graphics options), then this will be a worthwhile release. Right now I'm coming away feeling lukewarm about the whole thing, but that isn't a bad thing at all considering the early state of the game.","March 19, 2014","true","3.5"," 252 of 368 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","252","368","0","12"

You slowly realize levels basically funnel you along a mostly linear path and that the gameplay boils down to walking around with little to do/engage long enemy waves in certain areas/walk to and activate the next vortex to get a small bit of story/rinse and repeat. This gets dull after, say, 3 to 4 hours and when you realize the game takes between 12 to 15 hours your enthusiasm will take a pretty big hit.\n\nThe combat can quickly get frustrating as you get swarmed by wave after wave of enemies: you can dodge a few times before entering a cooldown and there's a block mechanic that mnost people find too hard to use properly: this either leaves you frustrated as you die and get sent back to the previous checkpoint (having to bear the long walk AND having to face all the enemies that have respawned along the path) or dial down the difficulty and slowly fight enemies that are still too much of a bullet sponge.\n\nLast but not least Battlemage's most interesting feature, its deep spell creation, is mostly ruined by excessive complexity and horrible tutorials: you'll have to search for several guides before you'll be comfortable with the basics and even then quite a few elements will remain a mistery.\n\nFor little more than 5$ when on sale the game sure isn't a trainwreck and can be decent for a while but due to the huge amount of shortcomings I honestly find it hard to recommend.","July 8, 2015","false","12.9"," 46 of 50 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","46","50","4","0"

The advertising goes like "be a mage with unlimited power, no cooldowns or anything". Having unlimited power, the "mage" feels fairly limited. Not only does your magic often enough feel incredibly weak and slow, the entirely unnecessary base damage/health value increase over the course of the game makes fighting a lot more annoying than it is fun.\nThe game starts off being rather easy. Enemies in the first two regions of the game (Drivasser City and the caves underneath) are pretty easy to defeat. However, during the course of the third region the player is introduced to (the snowy Greyteeth Mountains) difficulty tends to spike and reach a level where combat becomes a tedious chore and no fun at all anymore. Increasingly large groups of enemies dotted with more and more "miniboss" or "empowered mob" kind of foes start applying a headache inducing number of rapidfire CC effects on the player, which are terribly hard- to often impossible to dodge or deflect. For example, there will be a low powered ranged-attack mob shooting arrows that freeze the player. While damage to the player will break the ice, those mobs shoot these arrows in rather rapid succession, freezing you on every hit. This combined with CC effects of other enemies that usually spawn in tow of these can lead to the player being frozen, stunned, slowed or otherwise impaired litterally for minutes before there is even a slight chance to break such a chain, given that the player survives it at all.\nThat said, the players very few own useful CCs are usually frail, weak, slow to deploy and outright unrelieable. For example freezing: You can usually freeze most enemies with a simple Ice-beam spell or an ice shot, which usually works on trashmobs with no to little special effects. However, enemies which you would actually NEED to be frozen are either not affected, or the effect works only for maybe a half to two seconds, which doesn't really give you time for a worthy followup. That said, all enemies (especially bosses, minibosses and empowered mobs) seem completely randomly immune to CC effects like freezing or being held in place by a kinetic spell, which, as mentioned before, makes these spells utterly unrelieable. The fact that enemies tend to spawn around and right next to you, doesn't really help you keep control or fight systematically. I know that some level of chaos and surprise attacks by newly spawning enemies is an integral part of the fun in these games, but there is a fine line between it being fun or just utterly annoying.\n\nCombine all that with a completely unnecessarily complex and unrewarding spell crafting system (granted, the smart inventory crafting system helps a little but it has it's limits), unnecessary difficulty spikes through utterly over-powerful enemy types being introduced, and a completely off-putting story and storytelling.\nStory... I have yet to experience something of the sort in this game. Basically it goes: The Cult of Malthus is your enemy because it's evil. Go and murder as many as you can and kill their bosses. Oh and they have undead. Enjoy.\nThat not being enough, the "mage" (player character) called "Dragon" in this game, isn't actually a mage, but some random person the Cult has done wrong by, which is handed a pair of magic bracers that allow throwing spells, make you unkillable (if you die you get revived by waypoints without loadscreens and regular dying is actually part of the lore), and give you shields. The player character has actually no frickin idea how his/her magic works and is magic-wise generally a dumb n00b.\n\nPersonal note: I don't feel like playing a "mage" when the "mage" is just some random idiot with enchanted weapons and hasn't worked for their magic power by study or training AT ALL.\n\nAnyway, now for the positive aspects of the game:\n\nAmazingly beautiful environments. Seriously, the game world might lack some of the fidelity and dynamic effects of for example Crysis (this is a Cry-Engine 3 game after all), but still it is extremely beautifully crafted. Surroundings look entirely awesome, that much must be said. Characters, enemies and most special effects like spells or fire also look very nice (ice/freezing being the possible exception), but a game is not just about looks.\nSadly however, for all it's good looks, there's very little one can do in the environment. Shoot a few glowing plants or ice crystals here and there, and find a book or a scroll for some journalbound lore now and then, but that's largely it.\n\n\nThe soundtrack is decent, yet largely unremarkable.\n\nThe most positive aspect of the game for me is that, however in a game like this most people would maybe consider it unnecessary, the player get's to choose if the protagonist should be male or female, while the game is actually completely voice acted for both player genders. It might be a minor detail for some, but I find it very nice and would wish for more games to include that option.\n\n\nSo.\nVery bad and annoying combat gameplay, unnecessary damage/healthrange increases, needlessly complex crafting system (with the recent addition of an automated crafting system which is alright), really really beautiful graphics, not mentionworthy story that doesn't really make too much sense, player choice of gender.\n\nI cannot really recommend the game, but if you like first person shooters with a "challenging" gameplay in a fantasy setting with little in the way of a compelling tale and you don't mind retrying a lot, sure, go ahead.","November 20, 2014","false","14.7"," 180 of 260 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","180","260","6","12"

First off, they are right, never before has being a mage been taken to this extend as far i know. you craft your own spell from components, and each spells can be influenced in 9 different ways, some with varying results. Some spell can behave completely differently depending on their focus while others barely register a change. But this is because some spells are better suited for some things, Control fire is inherently less. interesting than say control frost, but destruction fire on the other hand.... The game feature a  large quantity of spell sigil, a decently long campaign with a new game +, challenging boss fights, i for one thought i was too strong for as moment, and the boss put me in my place.

Crafting spells is at the heart of the game, with virtually everything you experience hinging largely on your ability to craft the right spell for any given circumstance. Lichdom has some troubles with its learning curve, and there's a good chance you'll spend a long while trying to clear the first boss of the game, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be lobbing fireballs, calling down lightning storms on your foes from a safe distance, and blinking your way out of danger when it comes your way.\nEven starting out, the spell crafting system is a tad on the complicated side - there are literally millions of potential spells you can create from the 156 base spell types - so you'll do well to read up online, or check out the in-game tutorial videos to sort out exactly what you're doing before you waste all your crafting materials. You'll have up to three active elements of eight total elements available in the game, and three types of spells active for each element at any given time; Targeted, AOE, and Nova.\nThere are three ways to cast spells of a given element as well. Left-clicking will launch your equipped targeted spell, and holding left and right mouse buttons will charge up your AOE, with a visible circle on the ground for targeting, as well as animations to let you know when it's fully charged. Finally, right-clicking will block an attack, and timing a block perfectly will release your third spell type, the Nova, hitting all nearby enemies.\nDespite the difficulty of some bosses and game segments, the gameplay itself is spectacular. Combat is refreshingly fast-paced, without resorting to mechanics like one hit kills and the like. While blocking may be the preferred approach to not dying, I still find blinking around the area to be preferable to trying to time blocks, and the maneuverability this imparts on your character is profoundly game changing. Having used the charge blink for some time, switching back to the quick blink was like night and day for survivability.The entire combat system - spamming blink, charging auto-crits with your targeted spells, and laying down AOE effects for your enemies to wander into - is thrilling.\nLichdom: Battlemage tells an incredibly linear story, but does it in a fairly novel way, with most of the cinematics being shown in-game, and triggered optionally by activating purple rifts in the world. They'll show you a little glimpse of something that's happened in the area, offering some background and context for the zones you're playing through. It's not an open world by any stretch, and most of your wandering will be minor branches off the path to collect a piece of loot or recharge your shield after a tough fight. Otherwise, you're just walking along the predetermined paths, killing all the bad guys you see along the way.\nWith an remarkably robust spell crafting system and spectacularly entertaining combat, Lichdom: Battlemage finally brings the glory to the magic user that it has long deserved. Creating your own options for how to play lends depth and complexity to the game as a whole, and lets you tailor the experience to literally any style of combat you want. Lichdom crafts an intoxicating blend of frantic, skill-based combat and deep role-playing mechanics that makes it a solid choice for action fans.","July 2, 2015","true","59.5"," 53 of 64 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","53","64","0","0"

Overall, that pack had 40 games in it, including Halloween Harry and all the pre-DNF PC Duke Nukem Games. That was enough nostalgia to get me to bite, and so I wound up with this in my inventory.\n\nI'm trying to figure out a way not to be mean to this game. I really, really, am. But see, I played 40 minutes of this right now and something about it made me feel irritated enough to the point where I actually got a little physically ill.\n\nThat, for me, is a very strange reaction to have towards anything, let alone a game. I think I can explain how this happened, though.\n\nIn order for an FPS about being a hardcore awesome mage to work, you need a few things.\n\n1) Spells should have an obvious visceral impact.\n\n2) Controls should respond to the slightest movement.\n\n3) Menus and interfaces should be intuitive enough to ensure you're rarely out of the action.\n\nLichdom: Battlemage, for me, achieved none of those things.\n\nInstead, what I got was a game that very badly wanted to be both an exciting nonstop action mage FPS, but also a reasonably complex RPG with deep crafting elements. Lichdom seems to have succeeded somewhat in being a Frankengame because it happens to end up with the worst elements of a shooter, and an RPG.\n\nThe game gives up on explaining its own menus pretty quickly, leaving you to figure a good amount of the game out, and the controls feel somehow like you're always acting on some serious input delay.\n\nPart of me feels bad for not carrying on and giving the game a fairer shake, but I simply cannot enjoy a shooter in which launching a fireball takes a noticeable delay after I click, and has all the impact of a feather duster when it actually reaches its target. Enemies simply POOF out of existence with a little puff of smoke. Physics attached to enemy gibs could have really made all the difference here, but the system as-is feels somehow weak. For a supposedly tough-as-nails mage, I was left wondering why it felt as though my spells merely tickled my opposition until the game decided to replace them with a "dead pile of bones" texture on the ground.\n\nThe more I type, the more I'm reminded of that feeling in the pit of my stomach. Lichdom has a lot of great ideas, and that makes it all the more upsetting. It looks nice, but it's static. It aims to revitalize Hexen, but it fails to feel fast or responsive. It tries to tell a mystical story, but its voice acting and writing is all over the place.\n\nThese disappointments, and others like them, leave me with this uneffable sensation that enough is enough, and 40 minutes is all I can take. I simply can't get into this. Lichdom has the best of intentions, but intentions and ability to follow through are very, very different things.","February 8","false","0.7"," 55 of 68 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","55","68","5","1"

Too often, I failed blocks, so all this in vain.\n\nTip that worked for me: Dodge and use pillars to your advantage! Dodging is amazing!\nBy the way: Pressing the <Shift> key actives run or walk. Holding it do not make you run! (Realized it after 10 mins lulz)\n\nI would recommend it, but it is buggy and incomplete.\nYou can probably find better games.","February 18, 2015","true","18.1"," 52 of 65 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","52","65","3","0"

Instead it feels like I am walking from arena to arena fighting the same enemies using the same boring spells. I expected a huge aarray of fun and wacky spells to use. But all it is is an aoe attack, a projetile attack and a block. Is that really the best you can do? The magic in skyrim is more interesting.\n\nI saw kinesis and got excited, was hoping for something like the gravity gun in garrys mod or fus ro da from skyrim. What did I get? exactly the same as every other element it just has knockback or snare. really? is this what being an ultimate mage is like? Because its boring.

However, this game is anything but that for myself.  As you can see from hours played I have genuinely put some effort towards trying to enjoy this game, but have failed to do so.\n\nFirst, I would like to compliment the developers for actually creating a pretty stable, feature complete game.  In that regard, they have succeeded.\n\nNow, why don't I like this game.  The game for myself just amounts to a first person shooter... with fireballs, lightning, some status effects... etc..  There is little strategy involved.  You dart around, prep targets with mastery and keep them in place with control, and then finish them off with destruction.  There is very little else.\n\nThat and the controls can be a bit unresponsive when trying to quickly switch between spell types.  I have found myself many times thinking I switched spells after casting just to find myself casting the same thing twice.\n\nAlso, darting around is a bit much, and a longer teleporting type of spell, even if not used as often, would have been far more prefered.\n\nDid I feel like an all powerful mage by the end of the game, hmm not really.  You could have kept all the enemies at base level, and your power at base level, and you would have had the same game.  The leveling system for your spells, and shield are really not necessary when you really take a look at the game.\n\nThe worst part is all the enemies are pretty much the same as you progress.  There are projectile enemies (the most difficult to deal with) and your melee types (super easy).  A few odd ones but that is pretty much it.  Oh and rapid fire crossbow men that knock you down if you get too close, they are so much fun.\n\nNeedless to say this game is now in my trash category.  It was a good effort on the devs part, and I am sure this game is great fun for some gamers.  Perhaps it is my age, but I just can't recommend this game for more than 10 USD.

Out of any game I've ever played this game had the absolute best first impression on me. The novelty of the combat system was so immersive that many of the glaring flaws of the game don't become obvious until the combat becomes routine. The crafting system was a stroke of genius, and I really can't praise it better. Getting past the awesome crafting and using magic, its a strictly linear (and uninteresting) story. It boils down to a series of hallways connecting larger rooms where you fight baddies in order to progress to the next hallway... While it is an excellent combat system I personally feel like you should hold off if you expect to be entertained indefinitely by games you buy. This game has infinite untapped potential, but to realize that I think that it would have to draw more elements from many of the games that it is trying to improve upon. They made the mage feel badass, I certainly agree, but a lot of what I enjoy from the games in the genre this tries to redefine comes down to the storytelling elements and the open ended nature of the worlds. Put this combat system in a setting like that and you will have one of the best games ever made.","August 26, 2014","false","15.1"," 330 of 528 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","330","528","0","20"

In my opinion, different types of gamer will find the title lacking for different reasons.\n\n1) Gamers who are looking for a pick-up-and-play action title with big explosions and fun spells will likely be frustrated by the poor tutorial experience and the clunky crafting system. If you expect that a full-price game released in 2014 will teach you its key mechanics and make sure you know at least the basics to be successful, you'll be disappointed. The tutorials do not explain absolutely key gameplay mechanics. The crafting system, which is the only way to improve your character (there are no levels, talent points or skill trees - you only get stronger by crafting better spells), is not explained in the tutorials at all. If you don't read the journal, the official guides and probably ask a few questions on the forums you may not understand important concepts (such as how to deal enough damage to stand a fair chance in boss fights) and you may get stuck because your spells are ineffective.\n\n2) Gamers who enjoy more complex systems, don't mind studying tooltips in detail and experimenting with the crafting system, won't be bothered by point 1). However, they may find other aspects of the game frustrating. Once you've understood how the crafting functions, the game isn't all that difficult and quickly becomes repetitive. The enemy variety is poor and the only real danger emanates from a couple of ranged mob types. IMO there are some serious balance and scaling issues, which become apparent from the middle of the campaign onwards.  Some spell combinations are very powerful (killing the final boss in a single combo is entirely possible), whereas others scale poorly and start to fall behind. Gamers who are looking for the replayability and long-term motivation of ARPGs like Path of Exile will also likely find the current NG+ mode disappointing. NG+ is a series of short missions using locales from the campaign (the campaign itself can't be replayed on higher difficutly - it becomes completely inaccessible). However, that's where the similarity with maps or Diablo III style GRifts ends: the difficulty tuning just isn't tight enough to provide a sense of progression (beat content to get better gear to get access to harder content to get better gear...). You get progressively better spells in NG+ but these spells just aren't really needed.\n\nNote the above is not a full review and doesn't describe the game in detail.  I am focusing on the question whether someone should buy this game in its current state. Hopefully, this is helpful for some. If you aren't put off by the issues described above (all IMO of course), then by all means get this game: there are some fresh ideas at work and I definitely hope the Devs can improve/build upon the current game.\n\nBelow are a few links to reviews/other comments that I find insightful and that I generally agree with:\n\nhttps://boards.xaviant.com/t/few-thoughts/173\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/261760/discussions/4/34096318968616496/\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/261760/discussions/0/613936039539856174/","September 30, 2014","false","147.1"," 76 of 109 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","76","109","0","10"

It is not limited to only 3 types of spells - it's more like 8. you can only use 3 elements at once, but there's enough complexity to more intelligent builds that it is plenty.\n\nI've heard people complain about how it isn't as interesting a spell process as Skyrim. As someone who has played more than 150 hours of Skyrim, I can honestly say these people are wrong. Could it still use some things from that game? Perhaps so, but if I had to choose one over the other, I have found Lichdom's magic FAR more entertaining. Just don't do the standard DPS only spells, and you will see what I mean. Using spells to fill your enemies with insect larvae, then use mindcontrol to buy you the 10 seconds you need for the larva to mature before setting fire to the right mob... Well, that's just not something you can do in Skyrim, and it's a blast juggling it like so.\n\nYes, it's quite linear - this is true. Only a few branch off options to do fights for "loot". They are worth it, are a blast, and are often a great challenge.\n\nGive this game enough time for you to get to the first boss fight and get at least 2 interesting spell types in your inventory. You will find trying to build the perfect spell build to be very enjoyable.

What I got was a slow, disappointing and frustrating FPS where you are limited to 3 guns and 3 utilities with interchangeable colours where everything you do is delayed by having to either charge your attack for 2 seconds a shot or dodge hordes of brutal opponents who can corner you, stun lock you and kill you in very few hits.\n\nThe Game totes the idea of being an all powerful battlemage but if anything it just reinforces the stereotype of the pasty faced mage hiding behind a barbarian's muscles. It took me a while to realise this but the spells just aren't fun. There are clearly correct combinations I'm meant to be using and if I stray from this path I find myself penalised, not only that but you lose your experience points and levels BY experimenting, forcing you to commit to your choices. An equivalent would be if call of duty reset your progress with rifles just because you played one game with a shotgun.\n\nIn essence there are 3 targeted weapons, 3 AOE weapons and 1 perfect block. These are then either turned into either a non-damaging control spell (status effects or tactical control), an all damage destruction spell or a middle of the road, does some damage but not much mastery spell. you then augment this further by picking an element to give it colour. So what's the difference between a Destructive Fire Missile and a Destructive Kinetic Missile? The latter is purple and does half the damage, the same goes for all comparisons, they're identical safe for particle effects and damage numbers.\n\nBut this just means that the only spells that harm are your destruction ones so you will always need them to actualy get the kill. You might think then you use a freeze control spell followed by a destruction spell. That works fine when you're fighting 1 enemy but is impractical when you're facing 5 at a time with ranged support. You will find yourself running round in circles charging your ranged attack because all the spells are bloody mega-man style charge up guns and hoping not to get sniped in the mean time.\n\nThe enemies are tough, brutal and tanky, meaning that they will all need betwean 2 and 4 shots to kill, some also have disabling attacks such as freezes and knock downs which will leave you helpless on the floor or having to drop that spell you were charging to defend yourself, thus forcing you to start charging all over again.\n\n\n","October 26, 2014","false","8.4"," 90 of 135 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","90","135","0","2"

So I paid less than a dollar for what normally retails at $40 as of writing. Obviously that allowed me to lower my expectations a ton.\n\nThough deeply flawed and repetitive to the point I almost wondered if the game was joking sometimes, Lichdom: Battlemage managed to do enough to make me enjoy it. It's hyped up and marketed as the next big thing in AAA fantasy gaming but when you get past the shiny CryEngine environments and flashy effects, it really does play like a budget title. It took me a little while to realize it, and it's still fun, but its production values are weirdly out of sync with its overall design and had I bought into hype and pre-ordered this one at full price I'd probably be writing a long-winded rant right now instead. But with the mediocre reviews and huge discount, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed myself. Funny how that works.\n\nIt puts its best foot forward with its impressive visuals and professional-quality voice acting, with Troy Baker and Jennifer Hale as the fairly likeable interchangeable player or support characters. It looks poised to set up an interesting revenge story, but that falls apart pretty thoroughly The magic looks and feels good. It's easy to control. I wouldn't say they nailed the "unshackled mage" feel they were going for, but it's less bland than the treatment most games give magic, at least. At first, the crafting system seems impressively deep, and it's fun to tinker around with it to try out new ways of using each type of sigil until you settle on the playstyle you like. I played around with every different element, crafted hundreds of different spells, and never really settled into using the same strategy until fairly deep in the game.\n\nIt does a poor job explaining itself and new players will likely craft themselves into a corner if they don't know what they're doing. Plus, though the illusion of complexity is there, it really is pretty simple when you get down to it. It plays itself up with its elaborate stats and systems, but a lot of spells end up basically feeling the same, just a different colour. There are some exceptions, like the nifty corruption that grows big gross hives on your enemies rather than just directly damaging or debuffing them, but others are less creative. You can play around and do some cool things, but in the end the most effective strategy was just debuffing the enemy to take more damage then fireballing their face off. What could have been a drawn-out battle using corruption and necromancy or other more interesting elements became just zap, boom, dead, over and over.\n\nAnd the battles being over fast was a very good thing, I eventually found. The game is pretty long, and not because it's loaded with ideas. The levels are pretty, but they go on for ages, walking you from room to room, spawning the same enemies on you a hundred times, with no unique strategies ever required other than exploding them all yet again. With level design that's basically corridor, room battle, corridor, repeat, this game is just laughably repetitive. The same enemy types keep appearing all throughout the whole game, with the same annoying battlecries shouted at you each time, going down to the same spells, every time. A bit of exploring is possible with some hidden secrets and extra optional fights to get you more crafting loot, but the game doesn't have many ideas other than "use spells to defeat enemies!"\n\nThough I had fun for the first few hours, the repetition really sets in after a while. Constantly tinkering with my spells and trying new things kept me entertained for a time, welcoming the same enemies so I could try a new strategy on them. But once I found a setup much more effective than others I tried, combat was a bore, and crafting was a pain. They were just things I had to do to get them out of the way, which is bad, because that's all the game actually has you doing. I'd groan when new enemies would spawn in, and eventually was tired of spellcrafting to the point I just kept using the same ones, using the (not very) smart inventory system to handle the upgrades for me.\n\nI guess this doesn't exactly sound like a recommendation so far, but it's still a game that's worth trying and a worthy purchase at the deep discount I got it for. I've seen it sell for 90% off during Steam sales, and it's worth those four bucks. You'll have fun and enjoy the scenery and fancy magic explosions even if you don't ever end up finishing it. Playing half the game or so was enjoyable, finishing the whole thing was a slog, but I was still at least moderately satisfied that I got all the way through it. If the concept sounds cool to you, then you'll definitely find things to like, but don't buy into its over-budgeted marketing hype and expect a genre-changer, because it most definitely is not that.\n\nSo in short, it's a "meh". But it's a meh that tried, a meh with some good ideas, and even at its most frustrating or boring moments, didn't stop me from playing all the way through it. If you've been curious about this one, it has "sale purchase" written all over it.","March 1","true","25.9"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","31","36","2","2"

There is a lot of 'replayability' due to the fact that there are spells you must commit to in order to get them leveled enough to finish off the bosses.

The enemies behave like real people, not bots so you feel like your playing online enemies.\n(Prepare to learn from your mistakes and replay a few areas and bosses.)\nSome ememies can morph behind you which is unnerving and sometimes irritating.\nSpell Crafting is key to this game.

Excellent use of the CryEngine engine, locations feel real, many details, beautiful overall.\n- Magic feels very good, visually.\n- The whole "magic" part is based on a very good (and new) concept that has an amazing potential.\n- They tried really hard to make you care about the lore, the characters, the past events, but...\n\nCons:\n- Linear levels with some "goodies" on the side.\n- Repetitive x1000.\n- I honestly couldn't care less about certain characters or events. While I understood the story, I didn't feel "in it" at all.\nThe whole "previous war/moonbreaker thing is nice, but, for example, when Gryphon died, I've felt just nothing ! Couldn't care less... I MEAN I'VE BEEN TRACKING HIM AND HEDIRA FOR HOURS IN THIS STUPID SWAMP !\n- The inventory and the crafting system.\n\nThe problem is that, after a while in the game, you just keep doing this:\n>be at checkpoint\n>go forward onto the path that you cannot divert of\n>ennemies spawn of the ground around you\n>usually some running weak minions, some stronger various flying/walking/beasts/archers and eventually a lieutenant or mini boos\n>combo, kill, dodge your way out of the fight\n>go forward 50 meters\n>repeat\n\nSometimes you'll find yourself at key points in the story and you'll have to fight a boss... And that's kinda all.\nIf the levels were to be shorter and the magic really more powerful, the whole "repeat" thing wouldn't be such a problem. But here, since even the slightest minion levels up as the game advances, it still takes the same freaking time to eradicate them, especially when you consider that at the start of the game you would have dealt 50 damage with a particular combo, and at the end 16'000 !\n\nSo yeah, given the fantastic possibilities of this magic system, I would have loved a game that actually make me feel like a badass - mid-game and onward, you should have been able to oneshot whole enemies waves with well executed combos, instead of that, you're just doing the same thing over and over again.\n\nSooo...

The constant spamming and blocking really make for a dull ride, even if it looks nice. following a linear path just to constantly have enemies pop out of the ground makes it even worse. The story is the not so original revenge story. The spell system would have been nice if they actually made the spells more fun to use, without that it's pretty pointless. I understand that people worked really hard on making this game and I respect that, but you dont see me pooping in golden pouches and selling them saying "this will make you feel like a badass". this game in my honest opinion is nothing but a polished turd.\n\nGood idea, horrible execution.","October 24, 2014","false","45.9"," 38 of 60 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","38","60","0","0"

Finally, a game that seemed to fulfil one of the most engaging power fantasies I could think of: Being a nigh-omnipotent mage! Blowing up fools with the snap of a finger! Casually sauntering towards an enemy, all of their feeble attacks blocked by a ward! Then blowing them up! With the snap of a finger!\n\nUnfortunately, Lichdom: Battlemage ended up being one of the biggest gaming disappointments I have had in a very long time. This is an extremely linear corridor shooter with a needlessly convoluted crafting system, stupendously durable enemies and a terrible story involving cartoonishly one-dimensional villains.\n\nGame developers, can you please - PLEASE - stop making enemies bullet sponges? I am so incredibly sick and tired of facing common mooks that require seven crits to the face before they die. If my character really is, and I quote the official description, "a total badass with limitless magical potential at their disposal", then why am I struggling to take down even the lowliest of minions? On the easiest difficulty level? Come -on-, this is just a cheap way of artificially increasing the difficulty that is not even remotely fun, and it easily shattered what little immersion I had.\n\nIndeed, the game is not particularly immersive at all. The story is just so... Ugh. Enemies unironically utter lines like "This creature is no friend to the darkness! Spill its blood!". Human enemies, mind you, not hand-wringing goblins.\n\nIt is hard to care about the clichéd tale of revenge that the game tells you because the villains are written as hamfistedly as can be. They are basically mustachio-twirling, cackling baddies who would gleefully kill newborn puppies "for the evulz", and it's played completely straight. It is just terrible. The writer(s) should be ashamed of themselves for creating such terrible antagonists.\n\nWhilst I would normally try to describe all aspects of a game in reasonable detail, I simply cannot be bothered this time. The combat drags on, there isn't nearly enough variety in the spells you can make and the same models keep being recycled for the enemies. I frankly don't recommend this game. How on Earth the developers managed to make this game - a game about a mage unshackled from cooldowns and mana pools - boring and unenjoyable, is just beyond me.\n\nIt is a terrible shame.","February 20, 2015","false","9.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

However, the "smart upgrade" system doesn't do a good enough job of creating spells that are viable against the bosses you run into. I ran through the game at least 8 times in order to build up enough spell power to take on the second boss and still failed. The key to progressing through this game is to master the rather complicated spell creation process, which, for me, detracts from game play. Consequently, I gave up in frustration at the extremely high level of hit points you must damage in order to get past the super-tough bosses.\n\nMany games balance the game play styles by allowing multiple levels of difficulty. This one doesn't. Ideally, a player should at least be able to downgrade the difficulty level to get past a particularly challenging point so that they can at least get some of the value they paid for with their hard-earned money. Some game developers just don't get this.\n\nIf you're an avid/hard core gamer and you like this kind of fantasy RPG, then you'll love it. If you're a casual gamer or one that doesn't like to get mired in micro-management then stay away from this one.","December 6, 2014","false","45.5"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","2"

I'll make a little pros and cons list to start this off, then add my more detailed opinion afterwards.\n\nPros:\n- The controls are fairly solid and responsive (if you have a computer that doesn't lag too much).\n\n- The magical effects are amazing, so much so that I just want to launch fireballs in all directions just to watch them explode.\n\n- The graphics are superb; the game in itself is a form of eye-candy and makes gameplay all the sweeter.\n\n- The art style (which mostly shows in the cinematics) is brilliant and fits the style of the game quite well.\n\nCons:\n- I found that the game was riddled with glitches, such as my companion character constantly phasing through walls, getting caught on things, and, at one point, going in mid-jump to teleport only to freeze in the air for a while. However, this could just simply be due to my computer and I have not been able to compare this with other's experiences.\n\n- There is very little explanation in the game at all for most things, especially the magic crafting system. I found it to be bizarre and confusing and mostly just wanted to give up on making any spells.\n\n- The game is very linear; while this is not a bad thing in and of itself, it becomes very boredom-inducing when it is coupled with a rather uninteresting story. Half the time, I couldn't even follow the story and was more concerned about figuring out which of the linear paths I was supposed to take to get to the next checkpoint. Which brings me to my next con.\n\n- The checkpoints are placed in odd portions of the game, areas that are too far apart from one another or just bizarre. I found that this irritated me many a time when I died just before the next checkpoint and was sent ALL the way back to the last, which was what felt like half a continent away.\n\n- The gameplay, although fun and engaging at first, quickly becomes mundane due to a lack of diverse enemies and a strange tendency to throw in enemies which seem far too powerful for the level.\n\n\nIn short, I would recommend this game only when the prices is reasonably low. I somewhat regret buying it for however much it was ($40 or so I think) way back when. It's not too bad a game and has some really cool and interesting gameplay mechanics, but lacks in an engaging plot and consistently-entertaining gameplay. But, overall, it's not a must-play by any means.","March 24","false","4.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","10"

Not to mention, your mage is squishy as hell and can get killed by trash mobs if you're not careful.  Then the disappointment that you're only walking around in a corridor fighting the same enemies over and over until you get to the boss who's only more difficult because it's a massive bullet sponge.  This is Lichdom: Battlemage.\n\nXaviant started off well with some impressive looking spells in nice looking environments, then shot their own foot where it counts; making the game interesting.  Instead, you get a generic revenge story with mystery man who gives you magic.  As you run around, someone else drops in and out of the game telling you some useless garbage that's supposed to get you interested about whoever you are supposed to be fighting. It doesn't.  My first though about this individual who seems to have much better magic was, "Can't you just teleport into wherever and kill that guy so I don't have to play anymore?"\n\nInstead, we wander through one level to the next following one corridor to the next while the devs refuse to tell us how to play their game.  Their instructions go as far as telling us the three buttons we can use while we should be learning about the different spells we create and what each of them work.  It would be so easy to get an explanation every time we pick up a item.  Nope figure it out for yourself.  We have things that do this and that but it isn't until we actually craft them that we realize that cool freeze ray we crafted only has a range of about three feet, or that "Strategic" shield is different than the "Tactical" shield is different from the "Agile" shield and the only way to figure out the differences is to test them out and die.\n\nAfter enduring the corridor run for a while, you also pick up additional effects such as Fire, ice, lighting, kinesis, etc., but they don't seem to matter much.  Fire burns, ice freezes, lightning shocks but it doesn't seem to matter what you use. You would think a "badass" mage wouldn't be so squishy either.  Originally, I kept telling the devs the "tutorial" level was way too hard for first timers to figure out.  Supposedly they made it easier in a recent patch, took them long enough, but at the cost of getting sigils.\n\nTLDR; Walk around in linear corridors pressing the left mouse, the right mouse, and the two mouse buttons together until you die.","October 16, 2014","false","5.8"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

Not worth paying 47 bucks for this. Watch gameplays before playing, you'll really see how the game is. When I first saw this game I though it was like Skyrim, but with badass and powerful magic. It's not.\n\nI have played this game over 3 hours, and this is not an RPG game. In an RPG game, you have freedom to make your decisions and build your character, but this game has a linear story and the only decision you make is to be male or female.\n\nTryes copying Skyrim's magic system, but fails. Even though in the description it says you have 'Thousands of spell posibilities', don't imagine that you have lots of awesome spells that do completly different things. In this game you only have three spells: a missile, an AOE spell and a shield. It's true that there is crafting, but it only changes the spell stats (i.e. Critical Chance, cast time, etc) some decimals. But there are different elements, thats true; like fire, ice, lightning...Not really, they are all the same, only the graphical appearance is changed.\n\nMagic does not feel as powerlful as it look likes. You just go through single-way dungeons trying to dodge enemy attacks and throwing 5 fireballs to every single enemy to kill them (actually fire is the only elemente that makes some damage to enemies).\n\nConclusion: not worth it.\nBut, I have to say that the only decent things in this game are graphics and particles.","September 12, 2014","false","5.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

The spell creation is labyrinthine but rewarding. Unfortunatley the story is unengaging and a little flat, the pacing of the game is constant with relentless running through a linear map filled with combatants which can get a little numbing. Graphics are good and seems generally bug free although as its still in beta you will get the occasional floating wig or spawning with your head in the snow. It's also nice to be challenged and not just fly through every level without hitch like in a lot of modern games. The damage indicators and the loot collection give the game an arcady feel which although perfectly suited to this games complete focus on its great combat mechanics does nothing for story emersion although judging by the plot so far they've probably decided that its for the best that the plot fades into the backround. quick note, the voice acting isn't bad at all and although the protagonist does speak he keeps it to a minimum which is nice. prepare to die alot.","August 22, 2014","true","12.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Lichdom's protagonist would be a a badass mage, in any other fantasy game, you know, ones where you have teammates. The game gives you a nice arsenal of defensive abilites, but again, they would all be better in a game where you acted as part fo a group, as a way of fending off a lone foe the tank has yet to take control of, as it stands, if more than one enemy tries to attack you and their swings arn't exactly synced up, wave bye bye to that chunk of health, because most spells don't stun enemies out fo thier attacks and are just sad when defending against anything other than one attacker.\n-If you have an attention span: Dear god this game is repetative. You cast every spell with the same animations and even the more appealing looking spells get reduced to so manyy boreing lgihts once you have cast it for the 7,000th time. All the enimes are interchangeable, and all the levels are just hallways which are about as interesting to explore as the inside of a toilet paper tube.\n-If you like playing a mage in fantasy games: For a game world that was designed with the sole intention of being played by a mage, i am baffled by just how poorly optomised it is for that. Every single boss fight leaves me longing for a tank to take the aggro and most of the enemies spread out so far that the AOE spells are useless. You are about as squishy as the mage in any other games, expect unlike other, games like skyrim, you can't aquire any followers to compensate for the feeling that the game hates you for picking the mage class. Against other projectile users it basically becomes any other cover based fps, if you gun had crappy fire rate and no headsot potential.\n-If you like stories: people just talk at you every so often, it feels like every bit of interesting story is taking place without you, to the point i occasionally wonder why i am even still pressing forward. Even the inital cutscene that introduces the main chracter's motivation was so rushed and blut as to seem comical so don't expect much in the way of imersion.\n\n\nBottom Line: If you see this on sale consider picking it up for steam cards, if you are interested in that sort of thing, but if not just wait until one of the Elder scrolls games goes on sale instead and just download a bunch of magic combat mods. It will be about the same but with more content and a higher concentration of fun.","February 16, 2015","false","6.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","9","13","4","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demeryk/recommended/261760/","demeryk","Demeryk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demeryk/","200 products in account","SummaryLichdom: Battlemage is a singleplayer, first-person game where you play as a powerful mage, crafting and casting a wide array of spells from different elements and summoning minions to defeat your enemies.\n\nThis game has high production value, gorgeous graphics, and a bit of wasted potential, but because of its flaws - mostly pacing and replayability - I would recommend you wait for the price to be around $20 or your regional equivalent before buying it.\n\nStory elementsIntriguing lore & world building\nBuilding on a generic setting (pseudo medieval fantasy) but with enough twists and new ideas to make it fresh. The world is interesting and the lore is delivered in small doses, given you enough to keep you intrigued and hooked, never showing you a full picture via boring exposition. This goes a long way towards making you a part of this world and not an exterior observant that knows everything there is to know. After finishing the game, I certainly want to learn more about the kingdoms, the factions, and the history of this world.\n\nPadded longevity\nCompleting a playthrough took me about 20 hours on the highest difficulty setting while at the same time looking for the collectibles. It felt long and tedious per moments, because the pacing of certain levels is extremely off. Levels are quite long - not a bad thing in itself - but you will spend hours without any change to the scenery on the same objective (making your way to a location or chasing a villain, stopping only to fight another wave of enemies). Shorter objectives that are updated more frequently would be more rewarding and give a better sense of progress.\n\nUnderwhelming replayability\nThere isn't an incentive to start another playthrough of the campaign, except if you'd like to play a character of the opposed gender, which changes minor elements of the storyline, such as your character's motivation.\n\nThe developers added a New Game + mode in an update, allowing you to continue leveling your spells. While it is appreciated, it does not allow you to replay the campaign, but rather places you in randomly chosen arenas, each with different objectives. I believe adding leaderboards would be a great way to generate more interest towards this mode, because there is currently no point at all in leveling spells once the story is complete.\n\nGood voice acting\nVoice acting is good, featuring the talents of Troy Baker and Jennifer Hale.\n\nGameplay elementsBadass Mage\nThe game promises to make your mage character a complete badass, and it mostly delivers on it. You do not use anything other than magic. One hand is used to shield yourself from damage. If you block at the perfect time, you are even able to damage enemies. The other hand is use to cast projectile and area-of-effect spells based on eight different sigils (elements). You have up to three sigils equipped at the same time, allowing you to create combinations, such as freezing an enemy and then blasting him with a fireball. Later on, you unlock synergies, spells that combine two sigils and can completely devastate enemies and change the tide of battles, such as a tornado made of flames and ice, or an giant undead minion that is on fire!\n\nImpressive crafting system\nThroughout the levels, you pick up spell components that you can use for crafting more powerful spells. You can customize various stats about your spells, such as the chance to land a critical hit or the duration of the effect (burning, freezing). You can also break a spell to recover a component, upgrade a spell, and even re-roll components that you do not use to get better ones and a chance at a legendary component. All of this is relatively complicated if you don't check a guide, but the developers have also implemented a smart crafting system that will do most of the work for you. It works well enough if you're not interested in checking all individual components for the best stats, but obviously you can tailor your spells towards your play style better if you take the time to do it.\n\nDifficulty levels\nDifficulty can be changed at any point during a playthrough. The highest difficulty setting is quite punishing, but it also has a design flaw. At checkpoints, you can swap sigils, but doing so on the highest difficulty setting causes you to lose all leveling progress in the sigils you are swapping out. The games warns you about that, but it's still something that prevent experimentation and should be removed.\n\nGrinding achievements\nFor those of you that are interested in earning all achievements, none of them are particularly difficult, but be prepared for hours of mindless grind to level up all sigils.\n\nTechnical detailsGorgeous visuals\nThe game makes splendid use of the CryEngine 3 and looks gorgeous, especially on the highest settings. A jungle level leaves a little to be desired, but the other levels - underground caverns, ice mountains, cities - are full of beautiful vistas and textures.\n\nExcellent in-game settings\nThere is a wide array of settings, including a field of view slider and controls that can be rebinded. Various visual options can be tweaked to get the best performance out of the game.\n\nPerformance warning\nMy video card fits exactly the recommended system requirement on the Nvidia side (a GTX 670), but I had to make compromises in order to get the game to run at 45 frames per second. Even though I would have preferred to get it to 60 fps, I wanted the particle effects (for the spells) and textures at their highest settings to immerse myself in the game. Other settings, such as shadow effects, water effects, antialiasing, were all turned down. It is to note that there is an AMD logo during boot-up, so it is possible it is best optimized for AMD video cards.\n\nThe framerate was mostly stable, dropping only when there were hordes of enemies on-screen, which does not happen frequently.","January 9","true","43.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","9","13","2","0"

Everything else is the same. Game's not bad, looks good, fun for a few hours. Doesn't feel too much like early access (not many bugs to speak of), but there are some obviously in-progress set pieces.\n\nPersonally, i didn't find the game all that compelling. The magic quickly becomes an exercise in "blink everywhere you go", each enemy takes exactly the same amount of damage to kill, the spells take just long enough to charge up that you never feel like you're playing something "quick", and overall it's just monotonous. Different spell effects claim to do different things, but ultimately you wind up with one damage-dealer, and a couple of "i wish these were cooler" spells. The crafting is good, and it's required to get through the game - but it doesn't change how you play. You're just min/maxing your spells when you craft, they all act the same otherwise.\n\nI usually don't mind these sorts of things. Especially not when the game is trying to do something unusual. But in this case, it just doesn't feel like it's worth buying. Maybe they'll put more effort into it, maybe they'll fix the monotony.

If you love wizards, magic, or just want experience what it would feel like to be one... this IS THE ultimate spell caster simulator. On top of that... the game is very well polished, looks and plays amazing and is very fun. As you can see there is a ton of negative comments and feedback but these neighsayers have not looked deep enough into the game to realize this is NOT Call of Duty... or your typical FPS.\n\nLichdom is a RPG spell caster simulator.  You are gifted with the power of magic and learn how to craft and wield it to work toward your goal. There are no vast inventories of items like armor and weapons... you are a mage... you collect Sigils... and that is all.  Consider sigils the magical essence of a soul that only you (a wizard/sorceress) can harvest. That is your currency... that is your lifeblood...  Learn to get them, learn  how to use them, learn how to craft and make them better. You take a simple lightning bolt and make it into a lightning ball ... you can take that and make it an area effect explosion trap... then  you could add in chain lighting. Seriously, once you learn how the sigil system works... it will click and you will see that this is a really deep crafting game to your design.\n\nThe enemies so far have been challenging and every new area surprises me with something new and deadly each time. The graphics are top notch and very well done... down to the back grounds that go on for miles and miles.\n\nThe game is mostly linear but having a world open sandbox might be too much initially. Regardless, I love it.\n\nNow, it can get some what overwhelming to learn the sigil system... an Idiot's Guide to Sigils would help as would a Mage Mastery Spellbook (hopefully these will come out in the future).\n\nSo far the environments have been beautiful and deadly to traverse... and I just made it to the 3rd area... and can't wait to see more!\n\nI notice the team is very quick to put out fixes/patches and add new items for the game owners...  I respect that.\n\nJust to have the ability to create any type of spell you want to use in your arsenal over time... and blast through levels and have fun doing it... mastering the game itself is just as fun!\n\nBoss monsters?  Oh yeah... they are tough and they can be tricky!  Some thought and uniqueness has been designed with them also...  Kudos!\n\nYou can even craft new spells and go back in previous trodden areas and test it out (and get loot while you do it)...\n\nSure it could play like Call of Duty or Skyrim but the main focus is you are a mage... you cast spells and you design your own spells.  No inns, no taverns, no swords or bows you can get... no chainmail or leather armor you can don...  You are your own weapon...  you have a mission... DO IT!   :)\n","December 4, 2014","true","29.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

While this game is not for everyone, the same can be said of any game. Lichdom however, does manage to capture and improve upon many elements of well known and liked AAA titles (Skyrim/Morrowind, Dark Messiah, Diablo to name a few) in a polish that is almost non-existent in the early access phase of development/release.\n\nA word on the magic, as it is the sole focus of the game. You DO feel as if you have a multitude of options at your disposal while at the same time not being overpowered or underpowered. There are 3 primary banks (slots) that you start with: targeted - a not quite homing/not quite free fire charged spell, AOE....should speak for itself, and barrier....again should speak for itself. Where Xaviant have diverged from typical gameplay is in the way you customize these banks and create new spells through the crafting and synthesis system.\n\nThis bring me to my next point, the crafting. When done well can be a great experience in making the way you play the game unique to you and offering you freedom to explore that uniqueness. When done terribly...Diablo III, looking at you, it can be a lesson on tedium and pointlessness for the sake of artificial longevity. Again, Xaviant have succeeded in using what is considered established procedure but, redefining how it is done. There are NO tables, benches, tools, etc. etc. required to craft/synthesize/equip/reforge...it's just a menu. This means that you can change how you play when you like (I chose not to say "when you want" there because combat does not stop simply because you are in a menu) depending on what available resources you have.\n\nI'll define resources so there is no confusion, this is not Skyrim or Diablo, (dont mean to pick on these titles, they just stick out in my mind as crafting that could've been so much more) the resources you collect are in the form of orbs. The orbs are RNG based (random number generated) and can be either a new type of spell form, e.g. a ray/laser instead of the targeted type of primary attack, or ones that increase a certain type of damage, duration of effects, type of effects, form of damage dealt, method of damage dealt....there is TRUE customization here. While you spend these resources on crafting new spells, the game does something interesting. It doesn't penalize you, in the conventional sense, for wanting to explore different options. You can reforge a currently crafted spell and choose to either store the "points" towards a legendary item, or choose specifically which component out of the current spell you have selected you want to keep and use for another idea.\n\nAll this being said, the game does have room for improvement. I have a...I guess...beastly rig and with everything turned all the way up, there were sections that I was getting 30fps. I believe this is due to TressFX (tesselation of hair if you're into that thing) and is mentioned in the patch notes provided, so I wasnt upset or disappointed when my frames chugged while having this enabled. The only other thing I can nitpick about is, and this may just be in my case, there are no facial animations for dialogue. Again, may just be me.\n\nAll in all, if you're considering supporting this developer, thought the game looked good, liked the premise/concept, are looking to play a fun loot grind (which its not solely about I should add), enjoy crafting with actual customization, are a fan of Dark Messiah combat and Skyrim FPS magic....then don't fret over the "early access" status of Lichdom, it's well on its way to being a worthwhile AAA title.","July 22, 2014","true","17.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

It was interesting to see what you could do with various mixes of the spell components. However, the statement of "Thousands of spells possibilities!" is misleading. It is really the same spells with different modifiers time and time again. You choose your element (Fire, Ice, Lightning, ect.), then you choose the shape (Missle, Ray, Trap, Burst, ect.), then you chose whether to make it a damage spell, a status-effect debuff spell, or a stacking debuff spell that does extra damage when set off. Changing the element only really effects the status-effect that is inflicted, with little other effect.\n\nSpells aside, the rest of the game just feels... flat; as if the developers put so much work into the spell system that there wasn't much drive left for anything else. The level design is very linear, with a few side sections every now and then which eventually turn to dead ends. You'll find yourself doing about three minutes of walking between each battle, with little to do but take in the scenery.\n\nWhen you do find a fight, the battles are simple and predictable. You have melee types who run up and smack you, long-range types who rapid fire weak attacks and floating enemies that have AoE freezing attacks. Once you kill them, it's time to start walking again until you reach the next fight.\n\nAll in all, the game did not live up to any of the expectations I had for it gameplaywise.","October 16, 2014","false","3.2"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

I tried to get as far as I could with it, but frustration and repetition set in.  The combat was nice at first, but it quickly became a chore to play.\n\nFew spells gave decent damage for later levels and boss fights, and the game did not reward experimentation with spells.  If anything, it promotes sticking with the basic elements, fire, ice, and lightning.  All other spells become obsolete once you start making synergy spells because you can't combine any other triad of elements, and at badass difficulty, you're punished for swapping elements by having unequipped elements reset to level 1.  Whatever was the developer thinking when placing such limitations on spells when the entire game revolves around spell-making?\n\nAfter a while, the novelty of the combat wears off, and you realize that spells don't really evolve over time.  You just shoot the same fireballs, the same lightning, the same ice shards from beginning to end with very little variance in either appearance or stats.  The lack of progress eventually made me too tired of the game to even finish the story mode.  I didn't even make it to the portals and Newb Game Plus.

It is a bit rough to get into without reading about the different stats and such in the journal, which can take some time. But once you get a hang of it, it becomes very enjoyable. You truly feel a sense of achievment when you create a spell that is really strong compared to what you used to have.\nI've found that mixing and trying other seals out is key to get the most out of the system. (P.S. dont be afraid to unfocus a sigil to lvl up another because once you use them they level up pretty fast)\nI have yet to try out any of the synergy spells (the spells ranked over legendary rarity) since I have not found any that seems useful to me, so that random part of it can have you waste three legendaries. But at the same time you will drown in legendary spells towards the end.\nBut to conclude, my advice when it comes to the spell system is just experiment and find things out for yourself.\n\nJustified price?\nYes\nIt is well over 20+ hours of gameplay if you try to explore the entire levels and then add the hours it would take to complete the additional missions recieved after end game, plus playing the opposite gender in your second playthrough just to get some different dialogue and some small changes in story.\nAs you progress through the game you change spells a lot. That in turn makes the gameplay feel fresh and renewed which is sorely needed after having spent a few hours seeing the same visual queues from your spells.\n\n\nHighly recommended!","September 2, 2014","true","23.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It is REALLY partial, such as there is no interact button on the controller so you can interact with any of the spells beacons to upgrade or change your powers. You HAVE to use a keyboard for that. There's also a couple of abilities, like charge, that don't seem to work. If youre able to play this on a keyboard purely then it's quite good. It's got good graphics but it's pretty hardware demanding, I've run this on three different computers I own, all for gaming but only ones a serious gaming machine. On almost any graphics setting it lags pretty bad and is pretty choppy on the two weaker systems, on my main gaming PC however it runs beautifully at full settings. In the end my biggest issue is the 'partial controller support'. It's junk, literally the game cannot be fully played with just the controller and what makes that upsetting is that a handful of controller buttons simply aren't used in the game, it's like they started to develop support and then just dropped it. Overall if you're a PC gamer, loving your keyboard and mouse, it's great fun, but you'll need a pretty beefy system to play it smoothly. If you're a part of the controller trend like myself, then don't buy this, simply put you can't play Lichdom with a controller alone. Over all 7/10 as it stands, if they add FULL controller support it's an 8.5/10 easy.

And they have some great potential here to create a masterpiece in a form of a sequel. What I would like to see is more of an open world for exploration, CQC action with swords and shield, aside from just using your magic abilities, better narrative, more variety of foes to tackle.\n\n\nDo I reccomend it?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Braneman/recommended/261760/","Braneman","Braneman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Braneman/","741 products in account","OK this is the most important thing about Lichdom Battlemage:\n\nCrafting spells is deeper than it looks at first glance, and spell schools can and will interact with eachother in ways you don't expect.\n\nLemme give you one uber strategy that you can destroy the first boss with right off the bat, craft an ice control ray, some sort of AOE pool mastery builder, and a fire missle to crit the enemy. Drop the mastery pool, freeze the enemy in the pool and crit them with the fire spell(you always crit with spells if you charge them for a second or two, there is a visual indication) and you will annihilate the first boss. Ray spells also destroy projectiles shot by those crossbow undead so keep that in mind as well.\n\nNow lets break down how this works: Mastery is stored damage on an enemy it looks like blue fire, Ice control spells also store damage on the enemy and how much is listed in the spell description. When you crit an enemy with mastery on them you do even more damage based on the damaging spells mastery stat, a percentage number upwards of 240%. This can stack with ice's stored damage for almost double the effect, on top of the mastery.\n\nKeep in mind this is one combination of spells that I discovered on accident, all of the other schools of spells interact wtih spells in very different ways so they could change up this setup in a number of different ways. Corruption will pop out things that apply mastery, do damage or CC enemies if you leave it long enough. Lightning will arc to other enemies, Necromancy will summon  minions if you kill enemies tagged with it and you can infuse the minions with other spell schools by shooting them. Ice will store damage on enemies. Kinesis will knock them back. Fire will burn them. Delerium control will mind control your enemies pitting them against one another.\n\nEvery one of the spell schools listed above(are the ones that I know how they work at the moment) interact differently depending on the type of patterns you put into them: Nova, missle, lob, ray, pool etc. and additionaly interact differently with the secondary patterns: damage, mastery and control. If you aren't getting an idea of the depth of the game yet, I'm not even done yet.\n\nOn top of all this there is the shield system which is your defense, you have three health bars that regenerate as long as they aren't completely depleted. Craft better shields to get more health in these pips(as they are called ingame). On top of that you have the ability to block and to do a quick dodge, depending on which type of shield you have you can do a timed perfect block to cause a nova of damage around you and negate all damage. Or you can do a charged dodge and drop a nova where you land. And the nova changes depending on which spell school you have equipped and you can craft new ones for every spell school you have out.\n\nI hope this review helps you understand what this game is, its an arena based linear spell sandbox. And its a lot of fun if you have the patience to pay attention and press the i button to open up your inventory and expieriement. If you don't feel like expierimenting don't apply, if you don't feel like trying out the spell crafting system don't buy this game. But if you want to feel what its like to be a truly powerful mage through fairly open ended spell crafting pick it up.","September 8, 2014","true","6.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Any potential is trampled by the mind-numbingly tedious gameplay, levels that drag on for far too long and the supposed crown jewel; an underwhelming and prosaic spell system. You will engage in fights that are challenging and enjoyable; however, these are few and far between, and as you progress further into the game you feel less and less powerful as enemy encounters take an increasingly absurd amount of time to grind through.

There's a few side-characters that serve no purpose at all which ends up being highly irritating after seeing them a few times. All in all it's unfortunately pretty bad.\n\nI got the game based on it being very numerical and construction heavy RPG. Being a huge fan of Pathfinder and D&D based RPGs I figured I'd be able to delve in and create varied and extremely potent mages to combat the games challenges. Unfortunately the only numbers involved are in a poorly explained crafting system that in its most basic function allows you to create three types of spells which can be delivered in a few different ways. Had it only been difficult to create optimal spells I would most likely have enjoyed delving into the system and made good use of the mechanics, few though they were but the components you collect get better as the levels go by and thoughtful crafting felt pointless as later components blows your builds out of the water anyway.\n\nThe levels are pure gauntlets with a few hidden arena-type areas in which you can battle some extra minions to get even more spell-components. You'll be fighting the same enemies over and over and over, and did I mention over again only to end up at a boss-fight that's more likely then not only a slightly harder fight then everything else you've encountered so far. The hardest fights I had during the entire game was when one of the rare mobs mid-lvl randomed a few abilities that made them absolutely dreadful to deal with, mostly because you're more of a glass-cannon then a fighter and when something heavier actually hits you it hurts. These rare-mobs were few and far between and when encountered easily defeated with some wall-ducking (provided you understood their threat-lvl in time).\n\nIn the end I never tested all the elements the game provided because I had found the triple set that worked well for me, and the resources and time invested in them deterred me from deviating from them. The last few levels I gave up and just ran past everything I didn't need to kill because it felt completely pointless and at least the amount of enemies at my back made getting though locked doors slightly more interesting.\n\nI'm not sure for whom this game would be interesting, but it's not something I'd recommend without clear disclaimers.","January 22, 2015","false","15.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Good game, but not worth the full $40.\nPros: game looks good and was worth the price of entry. Combat is very fun for a good 10 hours and the spell crafting is neat. Bosses are challenging and fun.\n\nCons: Total amount of spells is less than you hope. I can count the types of enemies on 1 hand. Combat gets repetitive quickly.\n\nLichdom Battlemage was great for the first 10 hours or so. It was fun to level up spell items and find the special challenge areas to get a load of upgrades at once. The challenge of the game steadily progressed and you continue to encounter new enemies. The combat kept changing as you keep finding new elements to play with. Each element seemed to play as damage, support, or passive. The game breaks the spell types into Destruction, Control, and Mastery. Destruction is damage, control is typically a hold with delayed damage, and mastery is a damage multiplier. I honestly never used mastery as I was able to use necromancy as a more consistent source of damage. Taking the time out of you control/damage rotation for mastery buffs that only occur on successful hits seemed pointless to me.\nConcerning the amount of spells you can use, it really boils down to six types of spells. Primary = missile, grenade, beam. AoE = normal AoE, DoT AoE, and a trap bomb AoE. The shield also counts as a spell and procs a nova when you counter a hit, but.... I never used it as blocking interrupts spell charging. You can proc a nova when you charge a blink, but I always used quick blinks instead of charges.\nFinally, I never actually finished the game. Towards the end of the game I found myself running through areas because I was tired of using the same spells on the same enemies. In my final 4 hours of game play the only thing that changed was the environment. The enemies were the same, but they just got harder to kill. They also start adding barriers to the area so you are forced to fill enemies. I’d like to see the end of the story, but it’s just too much of a hassle.\nOverall it was a fun game. I can see a lot of potential and great ideas in here, but there could have been so much more. If this game had double the enemy types and double the spell types I could see myself finishing the game. I just got bored before the end.\n","September 6, 2014","true","14.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Instead of trying to save\nyour sister, you are being used as a tool by an experienced, older mage, to\nget revenge on the one who captured your sister.  You are playing as a 'battle-mage'\nwho has had no training in magic, but instead is using magical bracelets that\nchannel power from a true mage.  Huh?\n\nThe interface is minimalistic, which means what you are able to do is\nlimited.  The game is centered around 'spell combinations', but that is not a\ntrue representation of what is used. You can upgrade abilities, which makes them\na bit stronger, but the true power comes from crafting "spells", and\naugmenting them with runes that you farm during gameplay.  You have to farm, and\nfarm, and farm for these runes in order to really get a spell that is worthwhile, and\neven then you may not find the runes you want or need to make the spell augmentation you desire. To make it even worse, the game does a bad job of explaining the interface;  I had to spend time reading up and watching videos from outside sources in order to\nunderstand the capabilities of the complicated crafting system.\n\nTactically, the game is basic.  Very basic.  You face the same enemies\nover and over again, and once you develop a strategy, you pretty much just rinse\nand repeat with every enemy encounter.  The lack of intelligence in the AI makes\nit so easy to destroy.  The bosses ad a bit more difficulty, but even they can\nbe defeated  in a straightforward manner once you have the correct spell combination.\n\nThe game tries to make the game unique by adding minor nuances, but it\ndoesn't change the experience of the game.  You are still using the same power,\nand inflicting the same damage.  Unfortunately, this combined with limiting\nthe number of spells you can use hurts the game more than adds to it.  You face\nthe same enemies that have no tactical abilities over and over again, and\nthen relentlessly farm, making the game repetitive and boring.  This is not a\ngame I can recommend.\n\nThis is a summary of my review video, which I encourage you to watch\nif you are looking for a more in-depth review.\n\nThanks for your viewership and support; for more videos click here:\nhttp:/www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho","March 2, 2015","false","14.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I wanted to make powerful spells but lost interest due to the complicated crafting and not-so-great turtorials. HOWEVER, with the latest patch and the "Smart Crafting" system, the game got me again. I think I'm still early on in the game, but i will finish it when I have time.\n\nThe "Smart Craft" is essentially like this. Say you have one spell with A Lob effect, a Trap effect, and your usual Nova. The smart crafting will take what would work best with your current set up and give you the option to upgrade it. It'll even let you know and quickly synthesize your weaker upgrade items into more powerful ones. So basically, pick what effects you want for your spells, then the game will help you pick what's best for it. It's for those who don't wanna use a lot of time on the crafting system.\n\nThis is especially good for the game since a lot of the bad reviews are because of the crafting system.","October 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

You are a badass mage on a personal revenge quest and you've got a wide range of spells to choose from.\n\nYou've got traditional fireballs and AoEs as well as grenade like "lobs" and "rays" that are short range constant beams. You don't have any melee weapons but you can block, and if timed correctly, this will trigger a "nova" which damages everything in a radius around you. There's also a very useful dodge move. There is no mana limit or cooldowns so you can cast as frequently as you desire.\n\nEach of these spell "shapes" can be given an element which identifies the basic damage type, but also has unique bonus attributes. For example ice can freeze your enemy, lightning can chain its damage to other nearby enemies, and kinetic can hold an enemy in place. And this is just a small selection - there are several others to choose from. Its kind of like the magic equivalent of Borderlands' guns.\n\nEnemies include Human warriors and mages, undead archers and powerful demons. Many of them have access to the same range of spells as the player, as well as special abilities that allow them to shield allies, summon minions, teleport behind you, slow you, freeze you and more.\n\nLichdom is approximately 25 hours long and is heavily focused on combat, but with such a wide variety of spells and enemy types, there's a fantastic tactical depth and I honestly never got bored.\n\nLevel design is mostly linear, but many of the areas are quite wide so it doesn't feel too restrictive. You have room to approach enemies from different angles and plenty of objects to take cover behind. There aren't any side quests, but there are some hidden areas branching off the main path where you can find challenge rooms - kill multiple waves of enemies to be rewarded with lots of loot in the form of spell crafting components.\n\nCrafting\n\nYou gain new spells by crafting them. Each spell requires an element and a shape, and these components are rated from "common" and "rare" to "epic" and "legendary". More powerful components have bonuses to damage, critical chance, casting speed, etc. Sadly I found the crafting system to be very confusing. Whenever I tried to manually create a new spell, it was always weaker than the one I currently had equipped ... even if I was crafting with top tier components. So after a while I just let the game automatically upgrade my spells when a better version was available.\n\nStory\n\nIts not as detailed as most RPGs, and the player doesn't have any control over dialogue, but there are a few interesting characters. I especially liked the interactions between the two heroes, Dragon and Gryphon, and two villains, Hedaro and Hedira. There is some excellent voice acting from the likes of Jennifer Hale (Mass Effect), Troy Baker (Bioshock Infinite), Gina Torres (TV's Firefly) and Jaime Murray (TV's Defiance).\n\nTechnical\n\nLichdom uses Cryengine3 so as you can expect, the graphics for environments and spell effects are gorgeous. However, its also quite demanding in terms of PC spec.\n\nI'm running an i7 2600K at 3.4 Ghz, 8GB ram and a GTX 770 with 4GB Vram - well above the recommended specs listed on the Steam store page - but I can't maintain a constant 60 FPS on maximum settings (very high) at 1080p. The early areas seem fine, but after a few hours I started to encounter fights with lots of enemies which killed my framerate. I hate screen tearing, but with Vsync on I was getting dropped to 30 FPS.\n\nFor the last few hours I've dropped everything down to high, and enabled adaptive Vsync in Nvidia control panel. Its still not perfect, but performance has improved, and it still looks pretty good. I'm not saying this as a massive critisism, it hasn't hurt my enjoyment of the game too much, its just really a heads up to expect to have to do some tweaking.\n\nI haven't suffered any crashes or noticed any bugs. Controls are fully rebindable and work great with mouse and keyboard.\n\nRecommendation\n\nIf you're a massive RPG fan like me, I recommend buying Lichdom at full price. I don't like using numbers to review games, but lets just say the 69% Metacritic average shown on the store page is too low.","November 1, 2014","true","41.5"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

It was really pretty and the effects were cool looking, but honestly I was on the fence when I started. I played as the girl until I got to the first part where you can actually select a new spell line, but after another hour I got bored with Necromancy and decided to try something else, was equally disappointed with Lightening on the male as well. I think it mostly comes from the long charge times on spells in general. I understand for a more powerful boom that it takes a few seconds but omg. Even just quick clicking them instead of charging takes forever. A lot of my friends that played said "it's like a FPS but with magic", uh, yeah no. I don't remember any gun having several seconds to wait after pulling the trigger for it to actually fire something. This was obviously not the only issue I found with the game, but it was enough to make me stop playing after like an hour each time I tried. Playing the game is pretty easy but holy god the crafting system to upgrade spells. I had to just let the auto upgrades do its thing and just look at the results, if I liked the upgrade I used it, if not I waited until I got something else... if you're going to make a crafting system that almost requires the auto-upgrade system to figure it out, why bother even having it? Even the tutorial hints at "hey just use the auto crafting, it's easier".  With all that in mind, when it comes down to it, if a friend asked if they should buy this game, I would likely say no. Glad I got this on sale with a 50% of coupon through Loot Crate else I might be ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Still a waste @ $12 IMO.

NOT!\n\nI have to admit, at first I thought,  "A first-person, badass-mage-with-endless-mana RPG? Whoah!"\n\nSo I bought it...\nAnd I am still  regretting it...\n\nTL;DR? Just buy Skyrim with half price and x10 more content and play a Mage.\n\nThere are  MANY deceptions about this game  and I want to make them clear now, so you can at least save your money for something that's worth it, unlike me.\n\n1.  Open World? Nope. It is just a linear game, following the same fixed, linear route, without being able to interact with anything in the environment and groups of 3-4 enemies popping up from the ground at certain points to get you - will get to that in a sec. (No.5)  Also, I've barely played for 3 hours and I CAN CONFIDENTLY SAY that the game is repetitive as hell - you simply do the same thing over and over again: Move in small linear corridor > enemies magically pop-up from the ground > move backwards while shooting the same freakin' spell at them > REPEAT.\n\n2.  Badass mage? Nope.  You are basically a weakling who spams weak magic spells. You would expect badass explosions with spells and blowing enemy heads with your non-stop magic - Nope, nope, and nope.  All you can do is wield one spell in one hand and an annoying shield at the other which is only needed to block some ranged arrow attacks that are so lame that you can simply walk to avoid the arrow while it is coming at you. There is also a small radius AOE attack if you hold both Mouse Buttons but I rarely used it since it is weird to hit.\n\nIn addition, the one spell you can actually wield has a strange casting bug (I hope it's a bug.)  When you hold it down for a power attack, the spell charges, and upon releasing the mouse button to launch the Fireball like you would do in any other casting game, it takes an extra 2 seconds to actually shoot it, creating huge confusion on whether the spell was cast, failed to cast, or bugged out.\n\nSomething like: *Holds RMB* > 2 seconds to charge in hand > *Release RMB to throw spell* > wait another awkward 1-2 seconds with no hand animation > wonder if you actually held RMB long enough for it to charge properly > *hand makes the animation of shooting while the Fireball is still not fired* > *suddenly sees Fireball being thrown, after 2 sec of delay*\n\n3.  Difficulty? Nope. Even on high difficulties which can be rather challenging, but due to the game 'cheating' on you, all you do is move backwards and spam RMB to shoot your magic (I repeat, it's confusing to hold it down for a Power Attack since it is apparently bugged). And who needs to aim? You don't even have to aim. There is not even a crosshair in the middle of the screen to aim. All you do is cast and shoot, apparently Fireballs automatically find their target, even if he is 100 yards away.\n\n4.  "Awesome" Crafting Spells system?!?!?! NOPE.  There is no precise tutorial and no logic behind spell crafting.  Somehow, dead enemies drop a magical sphere/rune like thingy that, want it or not, just follows you and you collect it. That thingy is used to craft spells. Good luck figuring out how. A big menu pops up which I had to google it to find out how to bring it up (thank god for the in-game tutorial!) A list emerges before you with runes that you have no idea what they do, you pick one, then you pick another without even knowing what it does or what the term "mastery" refers to since the game doesn't explain that properly, then you pick ANOTHER extra rune and craft the spell.\n\nI crafted ONE spell out of luck, without knowing what it does.\nI equip the newly made spell which just replaced the default Fireball. Apparently my spell was a beam-like spell that you hold down and hits the target. Fun part: the spell did NO damage at all.\n(Then I had to figure out how to re-equip the default Fireball cause I couldn't kill a damn enemy with it.)\n\nAnd I am thinking: even if the spell simply added a buff for extra fire dmg on the target that someone mentioned (after all, I made the spell out of luck) even then, how are you supposed to take advantage of it since you have to unequip it and then RE-EQUIP the Fireball from the menu, which requires a game pause to happen, ruining the game's momentum?\n\n5.  Enemies just pop from the ground and  run stupidly  at you while they are hit by your spells. Simply move backwards guys. Even the enemies with the arrows fail at hitting you. I encountered 2 mini-bosses that they too, just run after you... so you either spam Space to Blink and/or simply hold Shift to Sprint and outrun them. Hardcore mechanics...\n\n6.  You can choose between the male or female  story  mode that has no difference in spells, just the story. Which is also - at least for me - poorly developed, with pictures for the cinematics that pop up once or twice in your playthrough.\n"Sister is taken by evil bad-guy with mustache and beard (AND a bodyguard), then a crazy MFer gives you spell powers so that you can take revenge" (Female storyline, I believe there is no need to mention the male one.)\n\n7.  The environment is literally DEAD. All you can interact with in the environment are some weird pillars that show you a weird ghost-story that you can  simply ignore since you have no time for such BS... you signed up for an all-action, badass mage game after all, didn't you?\n+ Some orbs in awkward places that restore some of your health.\n\n\n\nSorry for the sloppy review, but I am still sobbing for my 36.99... plus, I wanted to give you all the details of my experience. The list could go on but I think that everything else is just adding to the inevitable - AVOID THIS GAME.\n\nEDIT  due to recent patch: They added tutorials, FINALLY, but this is something they should have done from the beggining. My recommendation will STILL remain negative and I am making this a 3,5/10 from 2,5/10.\n\nScore: ~3,5/10\n\nI do NOT recommend this","September 23, 2014","false","1.5"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","16","29","0","0"

Not the best, but for the money you pay, it delivers on everything. I personally only have a few issues with it that I'd like to see addressed in an expansion or sequel, but other than that it's pretty good.\n\nThe spell variety is there, not much really needs to be added. You have Fire, Ice, Lightning for the basics, and then get to use stuff like Corruption and Necromancy later on just to name a few. The combinations of spells you can make though only varies from missile attacks, lobbed grenades, rain attacks, pools, traps, and some wierd blink mechanics. Not too varied IMO but each of those basic categories can be changed around to do three (3) different effects based on the core spell you chose. For instance: Shoot a fireball that only does a damage over time effect, drop a pool that teleports people that walk through it, lob a grenade that levitates people, etc. Pretty nifty.\n\nWhat I'd like to see in the future (should there be one) is a few more additional core spell groups, and more dynamic attack styles. Lightning for instance operated just like everything else until you got the special effect to trigger from the mastery buff, in which case it was actual lightning and not just a ball of energy. Why not some powers that fork upon hitting an enemy? Cluster bomb style lob attacks? Clouds that shoot ♥♥♥♥ at people? Walls, barriers and personal shields? The list can literally go on and on, and while some of these effects are in the game, they are actually so rare in occurance that focusing on those core spells because you like those effects actually hurts your ability to progress.\n\nMore enemy variety needs to happen. As much as I enjoyed fighting Undead, Demons and Cultists, there really needs to be more than just those three things in the game.\n\nCharacter customization for any possible future game or content.\n\nCo-op play would be great as well with as hard as the game is.","December 28, 2014","true","20.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

My first impression was a bit scary because as soon as the game launched for the first time, the screen went black and sat there for about 2 minutes, then my PC went into a loop between loading the first production splash screen in a window frame, and then back to a black full screen.  It did this for about 5 minutes and I couldn't even get to task manager long enough to kill the program.  Eventually I managed to time an ALT+F4 correctly and the program closed.  Given this is an ALPHA release, I figured that maybe it was just a resolution detection issue, so I gave it another try.\n\nThis time the game loaded, but it took a couple of minutes to get to the load screen, whose resolution was at 1024x768.  Given that I'm running a GeForce 770GTX I poked around in the options and set it to 1980x1024 with everything at the maximum available settings.  Not all options were actionable, but again I suspect this is due to ALPHA status.  The graphics are beautiful on this game, and for me, the framerate hasn't dropped for even a moment thus far.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, I found the first few minutes of gameplay to be lackluster because I was really expecting some sort of tips on how to move, and what the various keyboard keys do.  I had seen in videos that (i) was inventory so I pressed it and nothing happened.  Upon examination of the key mappings, I found that the (j) key is journal, and spacebar was blink. I found that the journal and inventory (crafting) panel don't unlock until a little later in the game.  The intro is hand drawn sketches, that I suspect will be a cutscene animation at release.  I'm hoping that at some point they make the NPCs mouths move during voice-over events.  Presently the character models just stand there closed-mouthed while the voice-over audio is playing.  Again, this is ALPHA, so I am just hoping they are working on this immersion breaking aspect of the game.\n\nAfter I reached the point where the blink ability tutorial popped up, I thought something was broken with my spacebar or the game itself because the 'charged' blink wouldn't work.  It wasn't until much later that I discovered (via experimentation) that the default unattuned defensive sigil disables charged blinking.  When you create a new defensive spell, you can create one that either disables quick blink or charged blink, or galvanize... or at least that's what I've found thus far.  Fortunately, the charged blink isn't really needed until you reach a canyon with a chest on the other side of a broken bridge in the underground cavern.\n\nThe crafting system is very cool, and I suspect that with the right spell components, you will be able to customize your spells to your own play-style.  For me, this is a tremendous feature because I might like to go a different route from the norm.  So far, I've been greatly enjoying the use of mind controlling a monster, debuffing the enemies and letting the pet go to work on them.  I love the AOE Lightning with a 7 second stun that adds 'stored' damage upon critical, combined with a targeted chain (arc) lightning spell is incredibly powerful, but can be the death of you if you aren't playing strategically.  The AOE I created gives the enemy haste when the stun wears off, but it is worth it, usually.\n\nI love that you don't have to just blow things up if you don't want to.  There are so many ways that you can progress through this game that I cannot wait to unlock the next tier of spells.  If you enjoy a challenging linear progression across a map (with the occasional excursion to optional areas), and releasing mayhem upon your foes, then this game is definitely worth a look.","July 6, 2014","true","38.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you play your cards right and learn the crafting system, you have the very real possibility of becoming a skeleton-summonning necromancer who drops meteors on the heads of his enemies, infects opponents with swarms of insects, debilitates them into fear and betraying their comrades, teleports them around the battlefield and manipulates time itself. But all of this takes time and a lot of mastery over the game's mechanics. Now I'll delve into the complexities of how does it work and why do I like it...\n\nThe game technically delivers on what it promises. You do have a bazillion of spell combinations, sort of like you have a bazillion of guns in Borderlands 2 or bazillion of distinct items in Diablo, but let's look at facts - there's 3 basic elements, being Fire, Ice, Lightning, Corruption, Kinesis, Delirium, Necromancy and Phase, there's a bunch of patterns in which you can cast said elements such as guided missiles, continuous beam, curved lob and various kinds of area of effect patterns, and lastly, there's three kinds of modifiers - Destruction, Control and Mastery.\n\nNow, the incredible variability of the game's magic comes from the fact that every one of the 8 basic elements gets a distinctly different effect based on which one of the three modifiers you use. The differences vary quite wildly, so let's take Corruption and Fire here - When you combine corruption and mastery, your corruption spell infects an enemy (or a group of enemies) with a blister which slowly grows and matures, and if you kill an enemy after it manages to mature, a swarm of flies will emerge from the dead opponent and start to seek and attack other enemies on the field. If you use mastery, however, the blister spawns a nest upon maturing, which orbits around you and infects enemies with insects that then increase your damage output done to them. Fire, on the other hand, just deals damage over time with control and stores its damage to be released later with mastery, IIRC. You can see some common patterns - destruction increases direct damage done, control causes some indirect effect and mastery debuffs enemies and increases damage done to them later down the line.\n\nAnd then, when you master the crafting system, you'll find that there are also synergies between the individual elements, which will allow you to do things such as summonning suicidal, burning corpses, conjure a small black hole and so on and so forth (hint: You can get these by upgrading a legendary trough synthesis screen)\n\nNow, it took me some time to get used to all of these various systems as these are the most important and unique part of the game, and for some time, I couldn't quite decide whether or not I like them. See, for an action game, Lichdom is an extremely slow burner and it'll take you several hours to get to the actually awesome bits, and it really takes a lot of getting used to. But after you do, it's a blast - discovering various new ways how different spells can synergize with each other, creating different patterns and seeing how it can affect your playstyle, it's just really cool, but it does require player to actually put in the effort and experiment - if you choose to remain stuck with basic three elements, which you can and nobody is stopping you, I can see the game getting very old, very fast. Oh right, three elements thing - at any given point in time, you can only have three elements equipped, where each element contains three spells - single-target, AoE and block/blink spell. That's 9 spells equpped at any given time, with some having similar roles.\n\nOf course, then there's the actual casting of spells itself. You're a glass canon, so you have to be very mobile (depending on the sort of shield you have equipped) and while there are no limitations on casting, casting a spell properly can take up to 2 seconds - doesn't seem long, but it does serve to change your traditional twitch gameplay style into something much slower and deliberate, which isn't something I've really seen in any other First Person action game, not to this extent anyway.\n\nThere are other good bits worth mentioning - graphics and aesthetic design are fantastic, post-release support is absolutely stellar and murdering stuff does actually feel very good, but none of that is quite as unique as the core mechanic of the spellcasting itself, why is why the game has earned my recommendation. However...\n\nThe bad\nRight, here comes the biggest flaw the game has, and I feel it's gonna be a dealbreaker for some - and that is enemy variety. There are ranged dudes, meele dudes, dudes spawning other dudes and dudes who are casters, but are actually just a more difficult kind of ranged dudes. They come in unded and living variety, but you hardly ever notice what it is exactly you're fighting, unless it's a boss or a miniboss. I would have definitely liked to see more distinct enemy types, which would ideally force me into switching my sigils around to see if I can get more effective against them.\n\nThen there are the 'powerful' enemies - I don't have issues with those per se, I have actually enjoyed the major boss fights the game throws at you, it's the randomly generated mini-bosses I hate. Sometimes, and note it doesn't really happen that often, sometimes the game just generates boss abilities which lead to extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t deaths, where the enemy one-shots you without you being capable of doing all that much about it. Thankfully, this does not happen all too often.\n\nAnd lastly, there's linearity. Aside from an occassional side-dungeon here and there, and a few quite open maps, the game is extremely linear, with slightly more open arenas for larger battles. There is some exploration involved, but not quite enough.\n\nJudgement\nThe game is extremely ambitions, but flawed. I'd suggest getting it on the sale, unless you want to support the dev who's extremely generous with functional updates. All in all, have enjoyed the time I have spent with it, and I would recommend it.","December 9, 2014","true","15.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The variety of spells and combination they hold is potentially limitless, with the concept of EPIC tiered abilities being tied to elemental attributes, causing caustic damage to multiple enemies at a single lob of an ice spell, or spraying flames from your hand in a ray of divine wrath that singes the flesh of the undead you torch as they run at you.\n\nThe storyline seems solid, and has some comedy to it, with the charming companions, and we playing as the 13th Dragon.\nI have found a smallamount of graphical bugs withing the Expiremental x64 build but it is otherwise beautiful with the assisstance of CryEngine 3. Great work Xaviant, I hope to see an introduction of a multiplayer/co-op fights later on towards the full release, or a wave mode.\n\nIf you want to know more about this game, all I can say is, spent you $30 now because this game is sure to be worth it!","August 1, 2014","true","8.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

From what I can tell it drops you after half way/ 3rd Boss in the game, before you kill a man named Shax and then sends you into the continuation portion of the game, that is very similar to Hellgate London's style of multiple portals you can enter and try your hand at objectives to strengthen your spells by gaining chances at loot or spells.\n\nGraphics = 10/10 This game runs higher resolution texture packs and looks amazing, physics effects are blended well, Character models are amazing. Side note - Glitches, TressFX hair anomilies, wierd spectral blue emination from ghosts and spectral beings, sleeve physics & character model clipping. None of these are a big deal as they know and have stated they will be taken care of for official release. No FPS issues, a few instances of frame timing issues that cause a stutter effect, folks this is an AMD optimized game and I am runnning NVidia(EVGA 760 SC ACX 4GB) and even unoptimized it doesn't make a dent at max settings 1080p Tress FX on, typically it stays completely even in the most complex scenes between 50-60 np with little variance.\nMy complements to the team on this.\n\nSound = 10/10 Environmental, music and ambient are well put together, fit very well and although they aren't completely distinguishable in their own right, they don't come off as sub standard either. This game could only really use a  catchy unforgetable symphony piece to amend that. Voice acting is done well enough with a dash of humor that you will find it funny but overall the submersion of the reality is never broken making the game come off as one big joke (Diablo 3 - I am looking at you, slapstick misplaced humor doesn't belong in a dark atmosphere) and the dread of the situation isn't lost. The bad guys can be a little over the top with banter especially the Evil tropes when thrown around are pretty well done, and don't feel misplaced.\n\nStory = ?/10 simply put so far its great, not mind shattering, but its a well piece of fantasy fiction well thought out and conveyed in a decent way. Until it is fully released we will not have a full story and as I have a few guesses where it may lead with a twist here and there honestly its done so far in a way I can't really see what is coming next(Diablo 3 Im really looking at you if within the first 30 mins I can guess the entire plot and story you need better writers) as there is subtle hints that the story can turn multiple directions. If anything its a little confusing but extremely fun moving forward to find out what is happening and putting the pieces together of several mysteries.\n\nRPG Mechanics = 7/10 I am being harsh because I am a huge RPG fan and customization is king for me, making a character my own and different from everyone elses is what matters to me. There is no way to choose how you look or to visually distinguish yourself other than a Male/Female Variant(-3). There is no Gear aka Weapons and Armour to either alter your appearance or any statistics on your character that can differentiate yourself by leveling up your character in any way in which you have choice in how the character is built as you progress through the story(-5), yep they are at -1 already on this, so how can I give it a 7/10 well they get 8 points by impressing me with itemization of sigils/spells and their components, the ways the spells are put together and the multiple options you have make for a never ending funfest, this is the type of game you can argue with 5 other people about your sigils/spell combinations the way you have them set up and the way you utilize them, truth none of you are right or wrong and you can pick and dissect and discuss to your hearts content, there is no I win button really but instead you are an overpowered castor with every I win they can give you. Sigils are limited right now, but they assure more is on the way, so no complaints here on that measure. Even then the customization with random lot patterns make for an unlimited possibilities ,\non top of that they have something similar to Baddass token in Borderlands for each sigil spell combo that is awarded when completing a required leveling task. Congrats the RPG isn't dead in fact I think we are heading for a new golden age.\n\nAction Mechanics = 6/10 Jump is replaced by a teleporting dodge in this game aka Blink, and it is your friend as you will eventially set the character up for a blink kite or a galvanizing tank sort of style, The spells have a feeling and weight to them that feels satisfying however the downside to combat is that its a little repetative, well no more than an Elder Scrolls game can be, a great impovement though for an FPS castor TBH. You have 3 spell types, Targeting(ray, lobbed grenade, missile), AOE( set trap or area of effect), Ward ( damage effect for a timed block of sorts) and a Shield , each RPG augmentation changes the Action of the game completely with synergies that give amazing effects giving weight to you are a badass mage. with 7 Sigils/Elements that play differently and effect the action themselves as well as the pacing of combat.\n\nOther thoughts =  This is well worth the purchase price, there is no multiplayer although they have stated it would because they would need to sacrifice way 2 much of the vision of the game to make it happen. That doesn't however mean its completely out of the picture either as stated by them, perhaps a standalone expansion focused on an arena of sorts where multiple players can take on waves of enemies and bosses would be a likely choice for an implementation without giving up anything on the main game itself, that would be my suggestion anyways. In the future I would like to see more sigils added to broaden the field of RPG aspect. Also to the developers and players they don't hold your hand in this game the tutorial is ok and gets the point across, but as for an explanation of how spells work, patterns, augments, and synthesis can and should be explained a bit better from what they currently are, a game needs to be challenging and have some exploration buyt in this case its vital information that can fustrate players when they realize they missed something important. Overall Good Job Xaviant I lok forward to release and to your future games I really think you created a special IP that in the future could expand in so many ways, just plz remember something that so many RPG studios have forgotten, RPGs are meant to be complicated beasts with extreme amounts of options and customization, streamlining and simplifing is never an answer, or a good choice.","August 8, 2014","true","56.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The more you play, the more powerful you become and that's a great promise for any RPG to deliver on.\n\nIt's also refreshing to see a game that doesn't make melee combat be the focal point of damage while Casters must cower in the back row and fling a Fireball every once in a while! The game looks amazing and the ownership of every death you plan for each enemy feels great and keeps me coming back for more. The spell-crafting feels empowering and it's difficult not to feel smart the first time you use a new spell you just crafted into that new Sigil you've just unlocked.\n\nI recommend this game if you can get it for the $20 price-tag it originally had but I whole-heartedly hope the story/plot and other aspects would prove the game worthy at the $40 price tag post-launch.","June 19, 2014","true","71.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Not ground-breakingly good either. But it's not bad.\n\nThe best way to imagine this game is to take a typical FPS, but instead of armor and weapons, you use perfectly timed shields or short 0.5meter teleports to evade, and spells for weapons. As for the weapons, you get the basic item called a Sigil, and you craft a spell from it adding all kinds of characteristics to it and such. Suppose your spell is Fire, Ice, Lightning, Necromancy. Then you decide whether it is a projectile (homing or artillery), contnuous ray, or area of effect, etc.\n\nThat, and it is linear. Sooooo linear.\n\n\nGet it at a discount. Worth it at a discount.\n\n\nUPDATE: I am finding myself using the Lob characteristic for my spells. The Ray and Missile characteristic is weak and seems pointless. The thing is, the Lob characteristic is the same for all spells. You "lob" the "magic" at your enemies (fire, ice, lightning, necromancy, etc), and when it hits, it explodes into tinier lob balls.\n\nThe Ray is the same for all spells. And the Missile is the same for all spells as well. There really isn't any real variety to the magics.\n\nUPDATE (Dec12,2014): After 30 hours of gameplay, this game DOES make you feel like a bad ♥♥♥ Battlemage. Like, "You wanna piece of me? Well I want a million pieces of you, ya little prick!" "Oh, what's that? You a big scary demon? I'll send you to the Abyss!" "I'LL BURN AND FREEZE YOU BOTH AT THE SAME TIME!!!" "Let's see you get resurrected after the Nothingness eats you, you incestous narcissist!"\n\nYeah!\n\nI just wish Quick Blinking was quicker and covered more distance as you upgrade your shields. That, and Charged Blinking was also quicker.","December 10, 2014","true","40.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The very little health you have adds to the value of the experience. The spellcrafting has some great ideas, but a better menu would make it more accessible when comparing statistics - a spreadsheet based menu would work like a charm (no pun intended).\n\nOverall it is a great game. The graphics are very nice, although the TressFX seems a tad glitchy. The story is well presented and I think that characters are very thoughtfully formed, however I think some character customisation like The Elder Scrolls would not go astray.

Don't expect too much from it though.\nThe centre of the gameplay is crafting. You find tons of parts to craft your spells. You first start off with just 1 spell-"element" and gain another with each level you finish. By using them you can level them up and choose between 3 things to upgrade which are damage, critical chance and critical effect.\nThe whole crafting thing is pretty much too complex to explain in detail here. With wrong crafted spells, bosses can become hard in a dark souls kind of way. With well crafted spells you might be able to kill them in under 2 minutes.\nThe fun really lies in discovering what spells you can create for your special needs.\nBasically there are 3 type of spells you can cast. One of which is a offensive ball or ray. there are different types of those too. The other one is an AOE which can have many different effects and a shield (which I barely use ever so it's pretty useless to me).\nThe story doesn't really get rolling and isn't that exciting. The levels - although not open world but very linear - are beautifully crafted thanks to the Cryengine 3. Enemies spawn every few meters and you gotta defeat them. New enemies are introduced only about every level and there is much re-use in enemies.\nFor less than 10€ I'd still recommend it.","December 13, 2014","true","12.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Whats most important is the gameplay. And how does it scale up? The story is boring and I couldn't give 2 sh*t about the characters in the game. They have zero worthwhile character development that gets me to care about anyone. Also the gameplay/enemy type is too repetitive. The same f*cking pattern over and over again. Reach an open area, a couple skeletions pops out and you just spam your spells until they die, rinse and repeat with other mobs. Bosses are just damage sponge, just dodge a few heavy blows and  spam your spells away. Uhhhrgh, i wish i could take this game and some others off my game library, it doesn't deserve to be in there with the other great games.\n\n\nFull Game Release Update:\n\nThis game does not live up to its hype or concept. Limitations to the doge have been made. You are no longer a badass mage like the game was first advertised. The Alpha was a lot more fun then the official release. The game is boring now. It makes having tons of spells pointless as they are all pretty much the same and you choose based on your prefered elemental effects. This game isn't worth the $40 bucks. Wait till its on 75% sale then consider getting it. Its so unfortunate that it didn't turned out the way it could've been. The game isn't terrible but not good at the same time. Its just plain and boring at times. I couldn't even be bothered to complete this game becuase of how dull its become.\n\n\n\n17th June 2014 Alpha Update:\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥ has the game been improved! The graphics are so much smoother and better then before. The load time is still a bit long but thats fine. The new updates added effects animation to your hand so now the game feels more personal as you seen your hand burn up/freeze up with your skin cracking as you cast a spell. The story has been improved tremendously, no longer are you some wasted drunk dude that a mage just picked up from the bar, but rather a pretty interesting back story with a f**king scumbag douch wanna choke him to death nemesis. The beginning of the game sets you in the mood for revenge as you see a rich control freak/cultist ruins your life over some small matter. You can now fast travel so that means its a semi open world game. The scenery is beautiful and damn does the spells look better with each update. This game looks like it will be around $40-$60 at release so i recommend you guys to grab a copy while its still cheap. This game is definitely heading the right direction and the developers deserves a huge round of applause. The other improvement i wish to see within the next few updates are reduced load time and add epic soundtrack!!! This game needs really epic and heroic choirs or chants while you do battle. The bosses are DAMN GOOD LOOKING!!!! If looks could kill, then its definitely the case here in lichdom battlemage. I will update this review again when the next major update comes out.\n\n\n\n10th May 2014 Update:\n\nThe gameplay is much smoother compared to the previous update. I only encounter 2 glitches so far. The one thing that has gotten worse is the loading time. It took 79 seconds to load the menu screen and 64 seconds to load the game (yes i timed it with my stopwatch on iphone). The loading time has always been pretty long, but after this update, it just gotten longer. This is my just my personal experience. Other than that, since i have not finished the game, I can't give my opinion about the story or boss fights. I only had 1 boss fight so far and it was kinda anti-climatic. All you need to do was run and "gun" which in this case is run and spam your spells. And what happened to the girl that was with you before the boss fight? It would've been better if we get to do tag team boss fights or even tag team through certain areas of the game, I just feel kinda lonely sometimes. The story is not griping at all, I don't feel like i should give a damn about my character or anyone else. There is a story but its really plain, like no big deal. I don't feel intrigued or gripped by the "story" thus far. I will update my review when the next update comes out.\n\n\n\n\n2nd May 2014 Update:\n\nThis game has tons of potential. I bought this game from just reading the description. The concept of having infinite mana and the idea of being a powerful mage just attracts me. We have seen lots of games such as Skyrim, Guild Wars 2 etc where you have to either wait for mana to regenerate, use mana potion or wait for a certain amount of time before using another attack. I'm not saying they are bad games, no, those are fantastic games but what I'm saying is that this game brings something new. Something we've never seen before. The game is still in pre-alpha so don't expect a polished finished game. Rather, this game needs your support. I usually don't support early access games but this one has my full support.\n\nNow for the gameplay, its still a little rough around the edges but thats totally understandable, come on guys its pre-alpha so relax. The combat feels a little stiff and i'm not sure if its a good or bad thing but bascially you are a mage with aimbot. No matter where you aim, your attack will automatially hit its target, not all the time but most of it. The other improvement that i think will greatly raise the bar of the game is to increase the spectacularity of the attacks. I'm talking about huge explosions, pillars of fire, ice, lightning and area destructions. Those are my only concerns so far.\n\nThe recent update greatly improved the performance of the game and of course added a story, so now we know whats going on, kinda. The attacks looks better then before and there are still some minor glitches but those can be fixed easily by the developers. There is a downside to being a badass. After  a while, the game feels repetitive, and a little boring at times. So far I don't see it as an RPG than can last very long. Maybe its because i didn't finish the game? I hope the game can add in huge side quests to increase the length of the game. These days a 50 hour RPG is pretty average. I also wish that there would be a clearer leveling system. Right now we get these achievement points which can be use to upgrade certain attributes of the character, such as criticall damage, critical chance and increased damage.\n\nOverall I just hope this game turns out great, with plenty of content and lengthy quality playtime. which means no boring side quests if they are adding those, more variety of enemies, plenty of boss fights, more variety of attacks, add in some lore into the  story to make it seem llike there is a depth to the story. Thats all for now. I will update the review once the developers update the game again.","September 9, 2014","false","3.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I was imagining unlimited Bioshock plasmids or Skyrim dual wielding with no cooldowns, but the end result is a much spottier affair.\n\nThe combat is the sole focus of the game - there is no exploration and a vapid narrative - and it is extremely daunting to the unitiated. There are multiple base damage types (fire, ice, lightning, etc), a handful of manifestations for the damage (AoE, missile, ray) and modifers upon modifiers, all represented with changing values and percentages. This in actuality is the real game - combining spell components and modifiers to produce more powerful versions of your spells, to counter the increasingly powerful enemies. The use of the crafting system is virtually unexplained: the number of confused and mournful comments in the game's community hub tell the tale. Lichdom begs to have an excel spreadsheet built into it's interface.\n\nThe game is basically Serious Sam - a corridor shooter pitting the player against utterly mindless suicidal enemies, punctuated by occasional boss fights. Despite an A-List voice cast the overtones of a narrative are laughable - small player activated scenes are placed directly in your path to tell the tale entirely with ghostly visions of the past, and in fact can be completely bypassed, begging the question of why the team spent the money on the talent. The world itself is dead and empty, devoid of interaction - the levels, long and desolate, filled only with the morönic screams of your suicidal foes. The game world and mechanics feel so streamlined that it's sacrificed any character it may once have possessed.\n\nThat leaves the fighting. The number of people unable to get past the first boss fight should be telling. There's no guidance presented in game, leaving you to spend hours analyzing the spell crafting system, read guides, or (most commonly it seems, based on the comments section) simply attempt trial and error with the game's ponderous crafting system and hope for the best.\nIt seems like the developers decided to continue adding more layers and systems to their game as development wore on, adding more complexity to the crafting, more stages to the boss fights, when that time might have been better spent adding more character to their world, or trying to tell an engaging story.\n\nAs it is I think they've crafted a very niche product for themselves and greatly limited their success. The only thing to keep you interested in playing the game is the act of crafting new spells itself. There's no compelling plot, no new areas to explore.\n\nIf keeping the steam overlay open to research your spells and calculate modifiers sounds like a gamer's delight, this is the game for you. If you were expecting a visceral action trip, look elsewhere.","September 9, 2014","false","10.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I simply couldn't decide is it worth recomending...\n\nSigils:\nA good variety of sigils but still most of them works the same way (in destruction) as debuffs well we have a good variety but still AOE spells ICE/Kinesis/Phase anchor the enemies more or like the same...\nI hardly can put Kinesis as a spell so I find it a bit hard to place in Battlemage role... It would be better to have Air based sigil instead of kinesis but thats just my opinion.\nNecromancy... I got a love hate relationship with this one... (spoiler) we fight undeads by creating more undeads well fight poison with poison but still somehow wrong... Summoning system is well executed you need to mark enemy and after You kill it you will get an undead.\nRest of the sigils did its work for me. Specialls were good just trigering them takes more work than effect...\nOverall - YES it was good - still could be better\n\nSpell crafting: Its a nice thing to have smart inventory and custom you cook your spells as you want. All options with crafting are good. I wanted more AOE effects and more targeted effects. Elemental summons would be nice to have not only as synergy type... thing is with one type of sigil and one type of spell you can actually beat the game so it is a bit linear... System itself is ok but it needs expansion. My expectations were much bigger... overall- NO needs expansion...\n\nShields: 3 types and they work ok. Idea with shields is a good one - YES for me\n\nPlot: (spoiler)\nAs we play plot seems to be ok. We wanted mostly to kick ♥♥♥ with magic so who needs a plot? :D\nWe have a vengance thirst for power, undeads, we meet a friend the friend gets killed and we need more vengance... In the end I think creators dimply run out of ideas how to end plot line... its really linear and borring and incomplete...\n\nPlot overall - NO it sucked...\n\nGraphics and animation - looks good all flows in nice colors and animation - YES it is good\n\nBoss fights: Some minor bosses were worse than the main ones... I had my time YES it was fun\n\nSecrets and specials: not so secret and not so special anyone with a sharp eye can get it all... NO\n\nFight in general: As I was closing to endgame I was begging for it to end... After some time it gets boring - It needed a bit more of variety.. But bashing the sh*t out of my foes still was fun - so lets say YES :D\n\nI recomend this game but ONLY on some good sales its not worth its basic price...

The spell crafting system is interesting and offers you to play it the way you want, but the menus make it a little confusing. The story lacks development when it comes to the world you're in outside of the magical elements, but the dialogue has this campy feel I enjoy.\n\nI don't recommend it at the $40 price tag, however, as I'm writing this, it is 3 dollars in a bundle on Bundle Stars. This is not shilling or anything, but at 3 dollars, I'm glad I got to try it.\n\nEDIT: Obviously, the deal on BundleStars is over, so wait for it to be ~15 bucks on a steam sale.","April 23","true","1.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I even got a new mouse because I thought it was the left click on the old one that was the problem (and it was, just not in Lichdom: Battlemage), but the arrows when cycling through the results of Synthesising, and the clicking on spells during equiping, they are a bit dodgy. Totally manageable, but also very fixable, I imagine.\n-Text size:  please, PLEASE, make the description text for the spells BIGGER, it's kind of hard to read all the details, which I do because I love the effects, but it's tough on the eyes after a while and I go by "which has the most green characters" :P\nAmazing game all around.

This game really does what it promises - create a kickass mage character that kicks ♥♥♥! It boldly casts aside the notion of class equality so prevalent in fantasy RPG in favor of a model that says, "Seriously? The skinny thief, musclebound oaf, clever ranger, and decadent bard are all equal to the mage, who wields the cosmic power of the universe as a weapon? Not in this world!"\n\nAt first this game was unplayable for me. I just tried playing tonight and the new beta release performs very well. So well that I just played for four hours straight, stopping only to get drinks from the kitchen.\n\nThis is going to be a great game when it is finished. It is already a lot of fun, and has its own unique character and spin on the usual fantasy revenge tale.\n\nThe magic system allows for a great variety of spells, all of which are very powerful, with different modifiers creating a smorgasboard of carnage choices. No more spamming magic missle (or equivalent) over and over to kill a single opponent. Enemies will fall fast and hard in a multi-spectrum rainbow of death and destruction.\n\nOh. and finally a protaganist who responds to being killed, resurrected and granted tremendous power somewhat realistically - "Ok. So you're just going to give me all this power?" in a bemused tone of voice.\n\nI will finish by comparing this to Bound By Flame, another game aspiring to turn you into the ultimate magical badass. The key difference is this - the combat in Lichdom, in beta stage, is better and more fun than Bound By Flame in its fondest creator's dreams. The magic system is creative and feels powerful and smoothly executed. Bound By Flame's system is rather restricted, and made unnaturally difficult by the combat system's clunkiness. Also, the story is better, and better told.","July 23, 2014","true","21.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

As you can tell, I didn't get very far in.  I'm pretty tolerant when it comes to games and I like to give them the benefit of the doubt, but this was just incredibly frustrating.  First, the way the game tries to teach you about the spell system is not good at all.  It rushed through and doesn't explain things very well.  Also, there is no "press space" to advance through... it's like an embedded video that lasts a few seconds and then goes away leaving you confused.  It also explains and tries to demonstrate spell abilities before you even get them, which is even more confusing.  Lastly, I was cruising along nuking things just fine, so I was OK with how disjointed and confusing everything was.  I figured I would learn in good time.\n\nUntil I got to a room in which there was my first mini boss and I got repeatedly owned in a matter of seconds.  The field of view was terrible, and the mini boss 1-shot me.

The first and Last!\nMaybe it's just me, but i expected more... much more.\n\n-There are many ways you can create spells with different screen effects, some are magic balls that you throw at long distance, some are like beams with impressive short range.\nThey're both useless, only charged attacks make actual damage and it s*cks charging them.\n\n-There is no melee, but there is a magic shield, you just need to time it more perfectly than humanly possible. When it works, though, it blasts almost everthing in "melee range" (wich is very, very short), it blasts your eyesight too.\n\n-Space Bar does not jump (Seriously, what were they thinking???), instead, there is a cooldown limited dodge that often makes you "blink" to the nearest enemy, always a heavy melee one. If you charge enough by holding space bar, you unleash a small area attack just like the shield counter, but with surprisingly shorter range, less damage to your enemies and your eyesight.\n\n-Your freeze magic does no damage at all and slowly slows slow enemies for a short time, but it gives enough time to swap to a spell that could actually make something, if you had one. Perfect to waste time if you are facing one enemy, and to get killed if you are not.\n\n-Freezing enemies attack fast, freeze you instantly for a very long time and you have to start whatever spell you were using from zero (Trololololol)\n\n-Melee generic enemies AI:\nRun towards you > Play Weird/Cute/Funny/Pooping/Sneezing Scream > Attack > Repeat.\n\nSimple, it would be too easy to dodge:\nWhen you hear the scream, just press the "not jump" button + escaping direction = Win! - 100% Easy.\nSince the "not jump" often makes you "not dodge", it makes it a bit harder... - 60% Chalenging.\nWhat if when you succesfully dodge they hit you anyway? Like 2/3? - 20%! Now That's Badass!\nPut 3 or 5 of these per wave and let's add some archers!\n\n-Skeleton archers AI:\nAttack you a couple times > walk a little at a random direction > play annoying laugh sound > Repeat\n\nSkeleton archers are the most pure essence of evil, they carry bow-shaped assault rifles that almost never miss, does not matter if you are behind cover, dodging or surrounded, they will hit you and they will laugh until they ♥♥♥♥ you off.\nIf you were bullied at school, you will absolutely hate this game.\nArchers also come in freeze attack versions.\n\n-There is also a strange mana-ghost-entity that has extremely high hp and launches area damage attacks, they also freeze you. Not much to say about this one, found only one and i died about 3 times fighting it... Plain pain in the ♥♥♥...\n\n-There are hidden places scattered through the map where you can fall and die, just because.\n\n-The game is Linear, with a few extra paths that give you less sh*tty versions of the same ingredients you will repetitively get, take you to the same places and/or make you walk in circles, since the visual is very confusing, and there is no map.\n\nOh, i forgot to mention! When you die (and you will, a lot), you lose the all the variable points that increase your loot value. And when i say loot, i mean repetitive spell ingredients. These points you get randomly when you kill something, and tend to go up the more useless spells you use, but sometimes not, it's random, try it if you are feeling bold, it's no fun and makes no difference at all, you'll die anyway...\n\nTo say i expected much more from a game with no currency, no equipment, no side quests, no "jump button", no melee attack and shattering video card experience would be an understatement...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordspiral/recommended/261760/","lordspiral","Spiral","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordspiral/","251 products in account","Full disclosure: I've been in the early access for this game since it was first available on steam, so some of my opinions are coming from a different perspective than many others, which got to see the completed game for a first impression.\n\nThis game starts off easy enough, with the player being able to just one-shot or two-shot most enemies in order to give you a feel for the nature of combat but then quickly starts to throw enemies that require more than just throwing a basic fireball at in order to kill without explicitly explaining how to achieve that higher damage threshold (here's a hint, read through that journal thing that keeps popping up, it's useful). Once you grasp how to actually deal damage, most enemies become cannon fodder that you can 1-shot at pretty much every point in the game provided your spells are somewhat up to date (here's another one of those hint things, you need to set up for your damage spell with either a control or mastery spell, or maybe even both.)\n\nThe spell system seems somewhat paradoxical to me. On the one-hand it seems to encourage experimentation, since different sigils and how their spells are attuned will require a different play-style and sometimes even a different build to get the most out of. On the other hand, leveling progress in a sigil will have been lost, which means a number of free small bonuses to that sigil are lost. However, since you can replay any previous area in the game once you beat the first boss this becomes a moot point since you can quickly blitz through the first level later on to level your sigils back up. Once you get past the hang-up of worrying about your bonuses (which usually amount to at most +10% to some stat for that particular sigil) and actually play around with sigil combinations, you'll realize how much flexibility you have with how you can build (a lot), although certain build patterns are stronger than others.\n\nEnemy variety is kind of lacking until about level 4 or 5 when suddenly there's a healthy mix of different enemy types being thrown at you every fight that requires you to actually prioritize certain enemies above the others instead of just killing whatever approaches you first.\n\nSince this game runs on Cryengine you can expect it to look good, which it very much does. However, that also means you can expect it to be very demanding on your hardware. I was struggling to get above 30 fps for most part with a computer above the minimum specs on the lowest settings, although even then the game looks far better than most games coming out these days, even if there is a feeling of a lack of polish in some areas.\n\nOne gripe I have with this game is the complete lack of a crosshair, which may not be an issue with the single target missile spells which have inherent auto-aim (which is annoying sometimes when it will decide to randomly target some minion other than the one you have designated to be obliterated via your CC/debuff of choice), but when using lob-type spells there's no sort of way to really gauge where your throw is going unless you develop a feel for it.\n\nIf I had to summarize this game I would say it's a glass cannon corridor shooter* that requires you to think about how to build and use your resources properly. It's very pretty and actually fairly challenging even when you know what you're doing, so I can genuinely recommend this, however I would also wait for this to go on sale first. I paid $20 since I was in the early access, which feels like a good price.","September 1, 2014","true","56.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ar7ific1al/recommended/261760/","ar7ific1al","Ar7ific1al","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ar7ific1al/","366 products in account","If I were to describe Lichdom: Battle made in one word, it would be "interesting."\n\nHow does it stack up?Lichdom: Battlemage is unlike any other game I've played. No other game I've played with a mage gives the mage such tremendous power. I love RPGs, and I love Skyrim, but none of the RPGs I've played really give the mage much to work with. Yeah, you have many spells on Skyrim to play with. But you can't do anything interesting as a mage, really, so I don't tend to use magic at all.\n\nOverall, I think Lichdom: Battlemage is a really interesting experience to which not many games can be compared. It isn't so much that this game is "better" than others; it's more that this game is interesting and different in its own rite.\n\n\nThe GoodThis game puts your mage in the ultimate seat of power. There is no real penalty for death, that I can tell. You are free to do as you please, mostly. See a ledge? Wonder what's at the bottom? Jump off and see! If you die, you just respawn with no penalty.\n\nThe game really does reward exploration quite well. There are various areas throughout that your "spirit eagle" would have you miss. So don't just blindly follow where the game tells you to go! Explore the path less traveled and you might find yourself quickly gathering strong and/or rare components for spell crafting.\n\nThe crafting system is also interesting. I started the game twice. The first time, I didn't touch the "Custom Inventory" and just stuck with the "Smart Inventory" as I just wanted to play the game and see what it was like. I stopped after I completed the first mission. The second time, however, I jumped into the Custom Inventory as soon as I could to see what I could do with it. I soon found myself trying every possible combination of components and spells to see what I could craft. The crafting system alone adds a whole new level of depth to the game, and it is quite enjoyable. It's a bit of a learning curve, though, so be prepared.\n\n\nThe BadThe controls might be a bit difficult to get used to. At first, you might not realize you can't jump. I found myself trying to jump and crouch as soon as I was able to move around, but found I could not. But don't worry, the spacebar allows you to zip forward in space a little. This becomes a bit difficult as you try out different shield types. Timing is very easy to mess up with the jump.\n\nSpellcasting feels a little slow at times. When you tap your mouse button to cast a fireball, you don't expect it to charge up a little bit before casting, you expect it to just do it. You quickly learn this is not the case, and learn to lead your shots. Missile shots appear to home in on targets, though, so it isn't that big a deal unless the target moved behind an obstacle and obstructed the path.\n\nThe tutorial videos showcase various abilities as you go along, and some of them use spells that you don't have. An early example is the use of the ice sigil, which showcases an ice missile spell which you don't receive when you unlock the ice sigil. Instead, you receive an ice "ray" spell, which you must continuously cast similar to the frost and flame spells from Skyrim. These spells you have to craft in order to use.\n\n\nFinal VerdictThis game is very interesting. It's made more for "guts and glory" than anything else. You're given such a badass mage role so you can finally tear things up as a mage instead of swinging around your weapons wildly. Have fun with your spells. Throw fireballs all over the place and see what happens. You might be surprised! I certainly was when I realized you could burn the grass. :)","December 10, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One review related it to Serious Sam but with magic, and being a huge fan of Serious Sam I was sold. Let me say I am suitably impressed.\n\nThe good:\nThe gameplay is excellent. Very fast-paced and enjoyable, the controls are pretty responsive and I loved that there's controls for keyboard and for controllers.\n\nThe game is beautiful, this place is screenshot heaven and the massive levels have such breathtaking and expansive environments. All of the spell effects are spectacular and the enemy design is excellent.\n\nThe lore of the game is engaging and I love finding it scattered around for you to discover. Those were elements I greatly enjoyed in Metroid Prime and I think you guys could take some more notes from that and expand.\n\nThe crafting system is complicated but I chose to forgo the Smart Crafting that does in automatically in favor or manually learning it, I had a blast making myself absurdly powerful and fine-tuning my build. Speaking of that...\n\nThe difficulty is decent, it's not too hard but the game will kill you if you slack off or get complacent. It might come across to some that you're too powerful, but the entire point of this game is to make yourself a godlike figure and obliterate anyone foolish enough to cross you. However...\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe developers relied a little too much on cheap abilities to make the enemies challenging. I understand that with someone so strong, it's challenging to think of ways to make enemies difficult without them just having ballooned up health or cheap abilities. That being said, the only thing that ever DID kill me was the cheap enemies. Now I've been gaming for over two decades and I've played a lot of RPGs so that's to be expected but still. I don't enjoy getting killed by being knocked prone and frozen solid in an endless cycle. I'll suck it up when I screw up and get killed, but the game always suffers if you die from stunlock.\n\nThe world itself offers glimmerings of having the potential to be very deep and have flavorful NPCs with emotional and meaningful interactions but damn it guys it fell just short. I understand limitations and hope to see it better in the future, it's still great and promising but it could be so much more! There were parts of the story that I didn't get closure on.\n\nOverall:\n\nIt's a great game for its price, this game is like the lovechild of Serious Sam and Path of Exile so if you've ever liked those games give this a try. Some people argue that the enemies get repetitive and while they could use more variety I think it's an unfair criticism of this game. It reminds me greatly of many good games I loved, it has a lot of replayability and you'll easily sink 30-50 hours into this game just clearing it once. I'd say that's worth its pricetag, given games these days offering half that for more price. It definitely has the replayability to offer 100+ hours, which very few games achieve even today.","December 10, 2014","true","84.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You don't get bored, but it's not varying battles or something like more open world games. Here you got 3 spells and then 2-3 variations of them, depending on your spell-setup.\nAlso,the variety of enemies isn't that great. You usually (as far as I've come in the game) just face off against some skeletons, zombies or the cultists that control them. The only exception is bosses and mini-bosses.\nBut enough about the bad, focus on what's great!\nThe graphics and setting of the world is stunningly beautiful, with varied environments and views.\nIt's actually fun to craft once you start getting the hang of the system in use, and there are great posibilities here.

This is one of them. So I'm going in and editing my over hyped reviews for games that I liked and trying to make them more realistic for the amount of time I sunk into them. Before I get to my review I want to remind readers that a gamer can only judge a game by his/her own experiences with said game. Don't just go by what others say about it, but do take it into consideration for a lot of people may have insight that you don't.\n\nLichdom Battle mage is decent. It's not amazing, it's not aweful. That in itself makes it a little disappointing. Here's a game where your supposed to be a bad ♥♥♥ mage with almost no limitation on what you can do. Sad thing is your limited by sigils and swapping out crafted spells for stat differences. In my honest opinion I do believe the game suffers from trying to keep the RPG aspect a little too much. The crafting system wasn't really necessary and it gets tiresome to deal with. Swapping spells you can use like you would guns in FPS games makes sense so that was pretty solid. However I believe this game would have had a better time being like old Quake, Duke Nukem, Doom games where you picked up all the weapons in the game and scroll through them with the mouse wheel or switch using the num keys 1-7 (or 8 I can't remember how many sigils are in the game right now). I do like how you have different methods of firing off said spells, like using a fire ball single target attack or the area of effect attack. I also like that you can have a Ray of fire instead of a fire ball, or how the fire ball can explode on impact and do the maximum amount of damage or start burning a target over time based on what you crafted the spell to be like. That brings me to how spells could have been a little more interesting.\n\nNow I'm all for challenges and intricate game mechanics but this game feels like it couldn't decide on being an FPS fantasy game or an RPG. Now with that being said I still don't understand why every one compares it to skyrims magic mechanics and yes I have played the game. Anyway, like I said earlier about being like the old FPS games they should also take mechanics from games like Crysis and others that allow you to switch the fire mode of a rifle capable of being automatic to semi-auto to burst, with just a key stroke. The switching between fireball impact, fireball burning, and heat ray should have been simplified. I'm using the one spell as an example because I haven't unlocked Necromancy yet and there is another spell type I have that I don't wanna use as an explanation besides you start with the Fire sigil. However instead you have to go through this crafting system inventory that seems pretty cool at first but then become pretty tedious later on. I feel the crafting system should be replaced with a skill tree or skill trees that give bonuses and buffs to the players abilities when leveled and yes I know the crafting system was made so that you can switch things out and not be stuck with your choice by deconstructing spells but you could easily do that with a tree system where you just switch out what skills you want. Kinda like you can have one perk or the other activated at a time.\n\nThe gameplay it self is pretty linear now where most may find that annoying I actually can see why it was necessary for this game. Besides it gives the chance to encounter really cool monsters and bosses... and stuff. Like I said trying to be realistic I think I've fought one boss and I can't remember who that was and the last time I played this game was a few months ago. The story isn't the most interesting but it's not dull either. Your characters motivation for wanting to kill the antagonist is simple. He killed your wife/sister (depending on gender choice) and a wizard type guy who has a history of showing up in times of stife (and also has a history with the dude to boot) revives you and turns you into a dragon. (Battlemage) Now I am actually intrigued with the story between the antagonist and the wizard guy, and there are these memory things that you find through out the game that give you some insight on the last dragon this wizard dude had. I have this weird feeling that your mentor isn't all what he's cracked up to be, but hey I need to beat the game to find that out.\n\nUltimately I still recommend this game because I do really like it but it gets kind of repetitive and the crafting system is really bloody tedious. It's nice that it's not too open but it does have secrets to find. It's a little too linear and it would be more understandable if there was variety in gameplay but this game is reminiscent of a game where you do nothing but be involved with combat and moving forward. No back tracking or anything and from what I have seen so far no real puzzles to solve. Maybe wait for a sale but definitely check it out.","December 17, 2014","true","4.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I've always liked the idea of mages and being able to combine different spell enchantments to make new spells sounded like a good idea. However after only 10 minutes or so the gameplay starts getting repetetive. The whole game is basically spamming your fireballs untill mobs of enemies dies. The crafting system works fine but different type of spells is clearly better than others so if you don't want it to take forever to kill one out of all the mobs you don't really have a lot of choice, which is a shame because the options itself are fine. The way they punish the players for dying is by making the crafting parts they find not as good as if they didn't die. This makes it so if a player is having a hard time in the game it makes it even harder for them because their spells wont be as strong so it'll just get harder and harder for them as their spells gets underpowered.\n\nPros\nAt first the fighting is fun.\nFully voiced characters.\nCrafting system has a lot of options.\nThe graphics are pretty and the spells are really well animated.\n\nCons\nSome enemies are really "bullet spongy"\nIf you experiment with the crafting the game punishes you for it because you don't get good spells and there's no way of trying out spells without crafting them first.\nThe story is not very intresting\n\nFinal words\nEven though I really wanted to like the game and be able to recommend it there is just too many flaws in it to be able to recommend it, especially for the price (36,99€ by  the time I write this review). If it goes on sale consider picking it up as you might have some fun.","May 8","false","2.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

Bosses will kill you in 3 hits and average enemies will spam you down in about 10, which equals ~2 seconds of taking damage. You are meant to use your pathetic 3m long lodges (only 3 of them every 10 seconds or so) or your shield, which slows you down to a crawl (considering you already move at the speed of a drunk snail, this is basically stationary), and blocks 50% damage at most. You can counter attacks by timing the shield, but as you are being attacked by 8+ enemies simultaneously, that is as useful as a rowboat in an ocean. With no paddles.\n\nFurthermore there is zero variety in gameplay. You can choose between different colours for your spells but if you think this crafting system is gonna turn your kinetic AoE into a gravity well that pulls enemies inwards, that you can shock for some crazy combo? No. You can prime enemies with any element, using Mastery or Control attunement (very logical), and then use any Destruction charged spell to detonate. Damage is not controlled by how well you use the spells, but rather by the stats on them. And stats it has. You will collect hundreds of blobs that add the glorious "+11% fapping time" to you jerk off spell. So in the end you will end up with a spell that takes half a screen to display it's stats, but is the same fireball as that other one you had. It just pumps out bigger numbers.\n\nThen also the enemies are all exactly the same. Melee guys, ranged guys and support guys. They mindlessly charge at you using their enormous health to tank your "Ultramega testosterone-powered oldspiceguy glorious battlespells" like it was nothing. Average fighting time is around 5-10 minutes per area (well, sometimes its 2 minutes, but feels like 10, because you always do the same thing), and if you die, you get set back half a level and have to do all the spam all over again. Every fight is basically kiting the enemies as they charge at you. No combos, no skill, or tactic will make it go any faster. Stats might, once you grind enough, but why would you?\n\nOf course this is a railroaded magic FPS and has no story to speak of (well none that would make you care anyway). I was told the woman is being voiced by some big celebrity. I am told I should care. I can't find a reason why. Basically you get screwed over by a cult and go off to kill hordes of the same bad guys because revenge and ♥♥♥♥. Mostly ♥♥♥♥ though.\n\nIf you are thinking of buying this for the story, don't. If you are thinking of buything this game for crafting, don't. If you are thinking of buying this to feel like a badass mage that sets up the whole arena for a combo and nukes the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone with one gloriously timed combo, absolutely don't. If you are thinking of buying this game for the visuals, then yeah. It does look good. I guess graphics is all their talent and focus went into. This is the worst and weakest I have felt as a mage in many many years. This game does the exact opposite of what it advertises.","January 5, 2015","false","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

I think the idea is spectacular, but the execution leaves me wanting a lot more. To attack you use the left mouse button, right mouse button, or a combination of holding them down.

I keep reading it's suppose to be a *shooter*, well being a magic user doesn't really lend itself to being a shooter. Not to be an awesome mage who drops lava from the sky to melt both enemies and land alike. A shooter is fast, instant even. A mage, they have to cast spells and shouldn't be able to just drop the moon from the sky to crush all the opponents at the flick of the wrist. Keep an eye on this one, it could go either way. I hope it's in the right direction. My recommendation is up in the air still.

But the spells equipped don't have to be the ones you are leveled in. This lets you test out sigils without losing the levels you've put into other sigils. Its a tenuous balace between encourageing experimentation, and rewarding consinstent use of a sigil.\n\nThe crafting is very very deep, and they could have done a better job explaining some of the aspects of it.\n\nMastery, especially is an extremely important part of spells that the game does very little to explain.\nAs far as i can figure, Masterty, is a debuff that casts to other enemys in a radius of the opponent hit with a mastery spell. Mastery also stores and stacks damage to the target.\n\nIt definitly has the feel of a wiki game at times, but the game is very fun.\n\nIf you're the kind of person that complained that Shadow Warrior was only about killing enemys, then you probably won't like this game either.\nLichdom's focus is on the combat and crafting. But it does it very very well.\n\nI've got 2 hrs in so far, and am enjoying the hell out of this.\nIf something comes up, then I'll append it.","September 3, 2014","true","24.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is my belief they have not really delved into it and tried that many combinations. In addition to that, there are more to the spell types you can use (Sigils) than shooting differently colored fireballs or area of effect explosions.\n\nYour spells are divided into three categories. Nova, AOE and Targetted and Shields.\n\nNovas are explosions that center around you that occur when you block attacks in the nick of time (counters, really) or, with certain types of shields, when you blink on enemies.\n\nTargetted spells come in the Missile, Ray or Lob variety. Missiles are projectiles, rays behave more like breaths, being cones of energy, and lobs are like grenades.\n\nYour AOE come in the basic area of effect explosion, traps and patches that deal damage over time or apply an effect for the duration of the spell.\n\nYour shields dictate how your block behave, whether you can quick-blink or not and how much damage they block and hp they add.\n\nNow all that is just for the basic "mechanics" for your spells, every single type of spells does something different and synergizes accordingly with the other sigils, of which you can carry only 3 but can do some godlike stuff if you study the system a bit and NOT JUST chuck stuff at enemies. For example, you can charge enemies with "stored" damage from a Lightning AOE and then unleash it all at once with a critical hit (guaranteed if you charge your AOE or Missiles). BUT you can also stack that with breaking free a frozen enemy for more damage, so you could, say, throw a AOE Ice spell on top of that and finish the combo with a quick charged Fire projectile. You just need to craft your spells carefully and wait a bit till you get proper materials, and then you'll suddenly find that your character can indeed be a mighty mage.\n\nNow if you're not convinced, here's a spoiler. At the point I'm at (not too far really) I can Synergize Fire with Corruption, and Ice and Fire. Synergy comes from spells above the Legendary Tier, given from fusing (Upgrading) three Legendaries together. What these synergies let me do is, essentially, summon a FIRE GIANT and a tornado of FIRE AND ICE to basically, clear whatever it is I'm fighting at the moment. I don't fell badass, I feel like LIVING GOD. Just play the game, think your ♥♥♥♥ through and you'll get there too!\n\nTL;DR: The real attraction to this game is the Magic system, but you need to try and learn it and wait till you get at least some decent crafting materials before you can use some good spells, but once you get there you're not a Wizard, you're a God.","September 10, 2014","true","26.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Bosses will kill you in 3 hits and average enemies will spam you down in about 10, which equals ~2 seconds of taking damage. You are meant to use your pathetic 3m long lodges (only 3 of them every 10 seconds or so) or your shield, which slows you down to a crawl (considering you already move at the speed of a drunk snail, this is basically stationary), and blocks 50% damage at most. You can counter attacks by timing the shield, but as you are being attacked by 8+ enemies simultaneously, that is as useful as a rowboat in an ocean. With no paddles.\n\nFurthermore there is zero variety in gameplay. You can choose between different colours for your spells but if you think this crafting system is gonna turn your kinetic AoE into a gravity well that pulls enemies inwards, that you can shock for some crazy combo? No. You can prime enemies with any element, using Mastery or Control attunement (very logical), and then use any Destruction charged spell to detonate. Damage is not controlled by how well you use the spells, but rather by the stats on them. And stats it has. You will collect hundreds of blobs that add the glorious "+11% fapping time" to you jerk off spell. So in the end you will end up with a spell that takes half a screen to display it's stats, but is the same fireball as that other one you had. It just pumps out bigger numbers.\n\nThen also the enemies are all exactly the same. Melee guys, ranged guys and support guys. They mindlessly charge at you using their enormous health to tank your "Ultramega testosterone-powered oldspiceguy glorious battlespells" like it was nothing. Average fighting time is around 5-10 minutes per area (well, sometimes its 2 minutes, but feels like 10, because you always do the same thing), and if you die, you get set back half a level and have to do all the spam all over again. Every fight is basically kiting the enemies as they charge at you. No combos, no skill, or tactic will make it go any faster. Stats might, once you grind enough, but why would you?\n\nOf course this is a railroaded magic FPS and has no story to speak of (well none that would make you care anyway). I was told the woman is being voiced by some big celebrity. I am told I should care. I can't find a reason why. Basically you get screwed over by a cult and go off to kill hordes of the same bad guys because revenge and ♥♥♥♥. Mostly ♥♥♥♥ though.\n\nIf you are thinking of buying this for the story, don't. If you are thinking of buything this game for crafting, don't. If you are thinking of buying this to feel like a badass mage that sets up the whole arena for a combo and nukes the ♥♥♥♥ out of everyone with one gloriously timed combo, absolutely don't. If you are thinking of buying this game for the visuals, then yeah. It does look good. I guess graphics is all their talent and focus went into. This is the worst and weakest I have felt as a mage in many many years. This game does the exact opposite of what it advertises.","January 5, 2015","false","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The numerous amounts of spells you can cast that it claims to have is abysmally small.

After several hours, it's infuriating to find myself not able to pass a simple part in the game, just because there are too many enemies for my small splash damaged, and single-targeted spells to do anything against. Oh and not to mention the ultra linear, generic plot and story. This game is lackluster compared to what it had, or claimed to offer.

On one hand, the concept is awesome: be a mage that's actually a badass. But the execution is a bit lacking, because you don't exactly feel like a badass. This feels like a solid first game in a series, but therein lies the problem: you feel like you'd be best off waiting for a sequel that fixes the problems.\n\nFor starters, you can only cast one spell at a time, which effectively eliminates all real experimentation with combining spells. Sure, you can (for example) freeze an enemy with an ice AOE then switch to a fireball and blow them up with flames, but it feels slow and sorta clunky. That example process which would take a fraction of a second in a game like Skyrim instead takes a full 2-3 seconds or so to execute. This rather slow-feeling casting system, combined with the oftentimes exorbitant amounts of health of enemies, means that in my few hours of play so far, I've spent most of that time kiting enemies and repeatedly throwing a lightning ball in their faces. Yes, it's absolutely awesome at first, but then the repetitiveness starts to set in. I spent an hour and a half doing nothing but kiting enemies and throwing my fireball-equivalent spell at them and repeating. Offense is pretty much just a test of your ability to backpedal without running into things while spamming your basic direct attack.\n\nDefense isn't a lot different. There are three primary types of shields in the game; I've thus far really used only one, the 'agile' shield. It has the fastest recharge speed and enables you to dodge infinitely. Dodging is done via teleporting a few feet instantaneously. But while I've only used one shield type for any real period of time, I don't think any of the others would be worth using in terms of in-game efficiency. Mashing the 'dodge' button and spamming attacks makes every fight a cakewalk, it's simply a matter of time before any group of enemies dies, oftentimes without even hitting you. The few basic enemy types have a nearly impossible time connecting with any attacks when you're dodging constantly. I've yet to die from a single standard non-boss encounter playing on the 3rd of 4 difficulty levels ('the intended difficulty for Lichdom: Battlemage').\n\nThis game is also extremely linear. Not every game needs to be an open-world sandbox like GTA or Assassin's Creed, but this feels almost like Medieval Fantasy Hallway Simulator 2014. You walk straight ahead, occasionally explore a short, basic side route, then continue trudging forward. It's sorta like Frodo and Sam in the Return of the King trudging towards Mordor and Mount Doom, except you don't have hairy feet and you can blow skeletons up with fireballs. There is nothing extra to do aside from kill whatever's in your path; there is one type of 'chest' per level that you can destroy for extra spell components, but that is it. The closest things to collectibles are journal entries you can pick up that you don't really care about. I'm all for games that are pretty linear (Call of Duty singleplayer, Max Payne, Shadow Warrior, stuff like that), but this is a little too much.\n\nIt might seem like I hate this game. I don't. I'm just disappointed in it. It had the potential to be one of the coolest, most different games of the year in my opinion, and it turned out...decent. The magic crafting system is really cool (if slightly confusing at first), the concept behind the combat is amazing, and it is fun to throw fireballs into a skeleton's face. I just wish it didn't feel so repetitive in so many ways. I hesitantly recommend buying this game, but not at full price. I don't feel like I'll get $40 of enjoyment out of it, but that's okay, because I WILL have enough fun to justify the $13.60 I paid for it. If you want to play something different with a great concept, go ahead and grab this for $20 or less. If you want flawless execution of a concept, pass. I'd give this a 6.5/10.","December 22, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They range from casual to Badass dificulty. I played on all of these dificulties and the differences between each are slim at least at the time of my playing. The boss I was stuck on I changed the difficulty from battlemage to casual, and he still had the same amount of health and did the same damage.\nIt seems the same even with enemies. Throughout all the dificulties enemies seemed to die just as easy, and I took high damage regardless.\n\nThe enemy variety is okay, but as far as I am into the game I would like to see more.\nYou fight undead, soldiers, armored soldiers, undead mages that fly around and cast shields.\nThe other enemies include cultists, some ranged monks and a slower mage basically.\n\nFor $40 get ready for some repetetive gameplay, maybe some crashes.\n\nOn a sale, I could definetly reccomend this game alot easier.\nThis is a solid game, I would reccomend it to anyone that likes ALOT of combat.\nThe story is here, it's told by these rifts that you find throughout the game which basically tell the past.","December 30, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/recommended/261760/","RJtheShadow","il Duderoni","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJtheShadow/","537 products in account","Lichdom suffers from it's own design.\n\nThe premise is simple. Design your own spells using the parts received by killing in combat. Easy enough, right?\nThere's even a Smart Craft systen in place if you can not be arsed to deal with the more complicated crafting system.\n\nOnly... the game punishes you, especially on harder difficulties, for not doing so. In fact, trying to learn and experiment is never really encouraged because your resources are finite and the new elements you unlock start with weakly powered versions.\nIt's incredibly disappointing to find out a certain element doesn't work together well with the others. Which makes choosing them (an irreversible choice) all the more disappointing. Guess you'll have to suffer through your terrible build for another chapter and see if you can get lucky!\n\nNow, truth be told, that issue could be alleviated with proper information. But at the time of writing, Googling answers for specific questions is absolutely ineffective. The best you can find is the same articles explaining the basics of the game you already know. I get it, charge up damage with the one skill and activate it all with a damage skill. BUT WHAT DOES THE SKULL DO? (apparently the Necromancy's skull, will fully negate any damage during block for a period, a fresh steam guide had to inform me of that)\n\nIf you want a game where you can mindlessly be a mage, this game is not for you. It's not "Skyrim 2, the linear hallway shooter."\nSticking to the classic setup will not carry you, even if you use Smart Cast to upgrade the levels. (which is a huge waste of resources by the way)\nNo, instead you need to figure out the best synergies with, again, too few information on any of them. And the information provided often proves confusing. The game simply makes poor work of conveying the information regarding it's mechanics.\n\nFine, you start experimenting. Hey, some combinations work and some elements are interesting in concept. It's like the game wants to reward you for thinking for yourself!\nOnly, they barely prove to be viable when the combat really gets heated. Which can suddenly happen, as well.\nYou'll be pitted against Bosses and Minibosses that, for some reason, are perfectly capable of withstanding your combo. Freeze is ineffective, Fire doesn't do enough damage... Meanwhile their skills overpower you and you can't figure out why you can't even dodge them.\n\nThe excuse that is being made then, when complaining about the bosses, is that you can actually easily beat these bosses with SPECIFIC COMBATIONS. This goes against the idea that you can craft any combation of spells in this game. Yes, you can craft them, but very few will be viable on long term and you won't even realize your combination is faulty until you've respawned 10 times wondering if you're just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dodger.\n\nThe game really doesn't inform you well on HOW you died either, or what is to blame. Just that you took enough damage (or with some cleary overpowered enemies, just take ONE hit right as they spawn) and died. You can't even look around for a final glimpse.\nThe lack of information, more than anything, is what infuriates me. It took me five respawns (not counting the respawns just trying to get to that point) to realize that it was a huge worm spawning in a direction I never was looking in, spitting it's insanely powered, slowing goop. Leaving me up as prey for the crocodile-like creatures to be chewed on and knocked back. Dear God, I shudder at the idea of being knocked back AND frozen at the same time.\n\nLichdom: Battlemage has an insanely interesting concept and completely falls flat on executing it by making only a specific set of combinations strong enough to take on anything. That counters creativity, a game that shamelessly says it WANTS you to create and experiment. What use are a 100 combinations when only 2 work?\n\nThe worst thing is, in some cases it's just the default spells being underpowered and you just need to craft a better version. But when that's not the case, you just wasted resources on an element that you won't end up using anyway, and have to go back to your slightly underpowered elements you were using before. Praying some enemies may drop some Rare parts that you can use. It's not fun to constantly die just to pick up scraps. Especially considering that dying once will reset the rarity chance, meaning that once you start losing, you'll have to get lucky or scrape by.\n\nStorywise... It's nothing to write home about. You can pick between a male or a female. The character, then nicknamed Dragon, gets wronged by an Antagonist and is joined by a the other charater now nicknamed Gryphon.\nThen you go on a tour of destruction through several settings while the plot dumbs down to "follow the trail to your target and kill them at the end".\n\nIf you can deal with constantly respawning with no satisfaction or feeling of progress, the game might be worth it. Yes, indeed, the crafting is interesting and it's probably a lot of fun on the easiest difficulty where efficiency doesn't matter a single bit. Doubt it'll be challenging or satisfying.\nBut if you want to get serious and play a harder difficulty, you'll need information that's poorly conveyed and hard to find on your own.\n\nWhat use is innovation if it's poorly implemented.","April 12, 2015","false","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The magic is flashy but it loses its luster the 400th time you cast the same spell. The enemies pretty much do nothing but run straight at you. The writing is subpar, the optimization is middling at best, and the "loot" system is so cluttered it becomes meaningless. Most "new" spells will be the same spell you already had, but doing slightly more damage, or lasting 300 milliseconds longer, or something like that. You feel like a powerful mage for about five minutes. Then you just feel like an accountant.\n\nThe worst sin this game commits, though, is being called "Lichdom" while not being a game where you play a lich. You're just some dude who can't even cast spells without his magic bracelets. Shameful.\n\nYou want to be a badass mage? Go play Magicka or Hexen or Dark Messiah or something.

Mostly it drags on for hours without giving much story at all. After putting in nearly 17 hours, I don't feel any closer to beating the game than when I was 5 hours along.\n\nBoss fights are overly difficult, and by not giving any enemies weaknesses there is a massive difficulty wall, especially if you don't get the crafting system early on.  On the subject of crafting, it may be the least explained tutorial in the entire game. It tells you how to make a variety of things and do upgrades, but it doesn't give you any idea about what affects what. It ends up being trial and error without much of a reward.\n\nOne other major issue I have is the lack of spell variety. When it boils down to it, there are only a handful of spell types with a handful of elements. The only synergy that comes from it appears when you waste away three legendary loots to make a red one, which will only give you a bonus spell type if you have both elements equipped. Not usually an issue until you realize you've spec'd into the wrong element for the synergy you just aquired.\n\nIn the end the game is barable at best until you get to the swamplands. By that point I have all but given up trying to... what was it? Avenge my wife I think? The lackluster story never really cared enough to bring it back up once the game went all Michael Bay.

Read the end for my final score.\n\nDisappointing on many levels. Graphics are solid and is one of the better looking games. Everything else is underwhelming. The game is revolved around you being a badass mage - too bad none of that really shows up. Some spells you can create are pretty solid, but the majority of them feel either weak or recycled. Throughout the game, you will make spells. These spells range from fire, ice, mind control and a few others. Since there are three main types of spells; Targeted, AoE and Nova, the amount of spells is a lot on paper, but there is less variety than you think; the majority of spells feel too similar; and that's a big shame. Throughout the average yet somewhat compelling story, you traverse through linear levels that have pretty looking environment. The enemies that are on these levels are too simple and there isn't much variety in the enemy types either. If you can catch my drift - the game is repetitive.\n\nIn a spell-crafting game, you want variety. This game doesn't have much, which causes it to be surprisingly boring. The game looks great, plays well - with solid framerate and controls; it also has a good loot system. The cons however, overflow the pros and the game is a letdown. It also feels like Skyrim's magic - which isn't a bad thing in my eyes. (Skyrim with magic mods)\n\nNow, I payed $30 for this game. Would I say it was worth it? Not at all. I don't have the drive to play it anymore - it was decent while it lasted and was fun for the first few hours, but I'm just not interested in it. If I did have the motivation to play it, I'd play it once through - you'd only play it again for new game plus (Doubt anyone would) or for achievements.

However, the game is very repetative and the spell variety is not that great.\n\nCombat in this game is fun, but gets boring after about an hour.  The game then gets quite grindy.

This game is for all those people out there who love to show what they've got against the surprisingly difficult enemies that arise in this game.\n\nSome POSITIVE points about the game:\n\nCOMBAT\nNow, when this game is finished, the combat will be ten times better, but already now, it's tricky, well-done, not too easy and overpowered but quite powerful. I love nothing more than tossing a firebolt, beaming a huge bolt of Lightning upon my enemies and blocking some green fire with a shield of ice. Using the dodging in the game as well as the sprint, tactics come in to play in this action-packed combat that is Lichdom - Battlemage.\n\nCONCEPT\nI always liked the Elder Scrolls games - perhaps you've heard of them (wink) and always thought there wasn't enough magic built into the most popular game, Skyrim. This is litterally that, but the opposite. With more spells than you can imagine, I cannot wait to unlock the abilities to make black holes, controll the minds of my enemies and send a toxic shudder through their bodies. I've only played 100 minutes of this, and I can't wait to play more.\n\nENEMIES\nHoly. Crap. This... this is some darn good AI here. When an enemy is wounded, it will retreat quickly, searching for a corner to hide around or a pillar to camp behind. If it cannot find anything, it will stand for a moment, panicked, and then attack again. The Minibosses are also excellent, with the occasional spells they cast they can demolish you pretty quick, and I'm sure the main bosses are even better. I haven't gotten the chance to meet one yet!\n\nSome things to IMPROVE about the game:\n\nMENU\nI know this is very touchy and not a priority, but this Menu needs to be fixed. I like how it's at the side, it's just very... stiff? When I hover over something, it instantly has a backround. I'd prefer if it lights up with a small animation, maybe with a nice little sound effect? I know this is just a small thing, but it'd make it look more professional.\n\nNPCs\nI don't know if this is just because I can only play 100% smoothly on lower graphics, but at least when I play, NPC's mouths do not move. This irritates me - please add this feature a.s.a.p. Also, when someone is talking, I can turn my head to hear them quiter - I love that - but the logic doesnt make sense, because if I just walk away it stays the same (Loudness? How do I say this? :I). Maybe make it so the character locks into conversations.\n\n\nThat's it, really. So if you're considering buying this game, make sure you do, it's great, and has a bright future!\n- VioletCooki (a.k.a The Bounty Hunter) [8/10 Stars]\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","3.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The world is drawn up well and you are able to explore a little outside the main path. The one thing that really hurts my view of this game is that you are never really taught how to play. It just kind of expects you to figure it out. Also, I don't really like the health system. You have three barriers and once one is gone, it is gone until you find an orb like sphere to regen not all, but one layer. And they never seem to be around when you need them. You can create shields but you never really have an idea how to do it. I might as well close my eyes smack few things together and hope it works. The archers are really annoying because it is very hard to deal with them while fighting so many others; they either need less health or damage. Other than that, the game is very fun. I like the idea of being a mage without cool downs or manna. I was afraid the game was going to be too easy because of this, but it defiantly is not. All in all, the game is worth it if you like playing as a very powerful mage. I am hoping the developers may change/work on some of the things mentioned before, but the game is still fun to play. --Alpha\n\nEdit: after playing the game more and restarting after a big update I realized one thing: This game is way too hard. It always makes you feel like you are doing something wrong.  I can not advance a decent amount in this game without dying.  I really think they nailed one thing about the mage: NO. HEATH.  I never feel like the charecter is powerful at all. But hey, It's still entertaining while you're not dying , and there are some pretty unique ways to attack the levels.  If you like a challenge  more than I do, this game may be worth your money. Also, the archers suck still; beware they're annoying rapid fire attacks that are almost as strong or stronger than the melee attacks from the other creatures. They're annoyingness exceeds even that of skeletons in Minecraft (this was the best comparison that came to mind).  --Beta","June 27, 2014","true","18.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

First impressions were mixed -perhaps because the game seemed to behave like a shooter rather than the more deliberate mage experience some RPGs seem to aim for- but soon the gameplay loop asserted itself, and boy, what a satisfying loop that is. Blast enemies, acquire new crafting elements, design new and better spells to blast enemies. Encounters are short and sweet, and it has a strangely addictive quality to it: five minutes after closing the game, you get the desire to go back and keep going.\n\nThere is also skill expected from the player. Spell stats alone will not always be the key to victory, and learning how to move, to teleport and to parry appropiately is essential. It feels good to see the mage as an active, agile character rather than one destined to lob spells from behind a fighter.\n\nThe aesthetics are also clearly very deliberate in their design, and all elements fit together to reinforce that you are, indeed, a badass. Some spells kick back mightily; others leave a trace of icy spikes in their wake; fire spells in particular sound like God's shotgun. The game goes big from the get-go, and doesn't stop. That, of course, can also be a downside: few moments of peace to counterpoint the action mean that it may feel repetitive, and the linear nature of the game can catch some players by surprise, since nowadays "mage" is almost synonimous with "open world RPG".\n\nAs this is an Alpha build, some bugs are to be expected, and options are missing; most annoyingly, the motion blur is very strong and cannot be turned off. For me, this means keeping play sessions short, as motion blur strains my eyes and gives me motion sickness, not to mention the performance hit mid-range PCs take from it.\n\nSome better feedback when damaged would also help: keeping an eye on the shield bars (pretty much your health meter) constantly can de distracting, and without a stronger visual indication that you are getting pummelled, death often seems to come out of nowhere.\n\nAll in all, the ideas behind the game are solid, and there is a vision in place. As time goes by, I'm confident the execution on that vision will become more polished. I expect to update this review as I play on: so far the worldbuilding shows hints of something interesting, but without more playtime, it's impossible to tell how that may be realized.","July 1, 2014","true","9.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Now having put a total of 12 hours into the game (from its prior state and across several of the implemented features) i can say roughly how far this game has gone.\n\nIts further than i might have expected in such a shot amount of time.\n\nof the problems, there are the occasional start up crashes and the textures in cutscenes sometimes glitch up (though not as extreme as in the earliest stages of development, when Roths cape seemed to be trying to bisect him) and a small cutscene where the player is flipped upside down is marred somewhat by some minor graphic collision bugs. generally not as bad as in some other titles.\n\nThe key improvements to the game have been in 2 key areas, notably in the story. With a choice of either a male or female 'dragon' (the other character serving as your 'gryphon'), the story is much more clear and fleshed out, with the cult of Malthus threatening the world and you receiving the power to stop them and get personal revenge against certain members of the cult. the story flows at a good pace and it is not totally destracting from the main crux of the game- the Combat.\n\nCombat in Lichdom consists of flinging spells at enemies, blocking melee attacks with barrier spells, blinking to dodge projectiles and melee swings and keeping an eye on your health bars. Its simple to learn- and then you start crafting spells. The Amount of customisation put into crafting your spells is, like the combat simple to learn, but harder to master. With 3 distinctively different spell focuses (my name for it, not the actual one), the variation in spells you can craft becomes more impressive and more about the players personal taste. Destruction is about blasting enemies into fragments of bone, flesh and spell effects in a gloriously spectacular fashion. Contol is about applying status problems to enemies, Freezing them solid, setting them on fire, or making them a thrall to your will (until they realise they had been readily chopping up their allies, turn on you and are reduced to a red stain of bone) is all part of keeping the player in control of the flow of battle. Mastery applies debuffs that help you keep the battle at the players level, forcing enemies to flee etc. The Focuses all blend together, with destruction magic synergising with contol for brilliant overkills.\n\nSpell types are also in a nice varied collection. Targeted (Left Mouse) deal quickfire single damage, Barriers (Right Mouse) help to sheild damage or even hit the enemy with a well timed nova block, and  an aoe(Rmb and LMB Held down at the same time and then released) brings death to the enemy at a long range. Enemies also are just as varied coordinated as ever, with melee troops lunging at you and sidstepping harmful attacks, and ranged troops throwing lots of projectiles at you forceing you to move in case of a volley of fire.\n\nAll in all, the game still stands for some polish but I Have no problem with having a blast playing Lichdom:Battlemage.

Corridors, roads and passages serve as both opportunities to get fed some story from your companion AI character (who serves only this purpose, (s)he never actually participates in combat), and as a way to take in some scenery. The dialogue is fairly standard but executed with a good degree of skill, which prevents it from becoming annoying and keeps the game from becoming too stale.\n\nThe two main draws of this game as, as mentioned earlier, the combat and also the crafting system.\nAs you kill enemies, loot "chests" and destroy random things you are awarded spell components that come in several varieties, which you combine to create all new spells for you to use in combat.\nThe spell creation system can be a bit daunting until you figure it all out, but thankfully the game comes with an "auto-craft" function that can automatically upgrade your spells for you at the touch of a button. You'll frequently resort to this in the beginning, but as you progress to the mid and late game you'll gradually start to understand how it all fits together and start to fiddle with it to create some pretty nice spells that combo with eachother to explosive effect.\n\nThis is the cycle of the game, really. You kill stuff to get more spell components, which you craft into spells used to kill more stuff to get more components.\nThe game lets you select a new Sigil (which is kinda like an element such as fire or ice) to use as a base for your spells at the end of a level, and spells created with them can have very different effects since they're good at different things. While you can switch which 3 of these you can have equipped at a time, you can change them at any savepoint to spice things up if things gets too repetitive.\n\nThe game also features some rather brutal boss fights, and if you're unprepared you WILL get your ♥♥♥ handed to you.\nThere are plenty of strategies available on the net to use if want, but if i were to give one piece of advice then it's this: never use a shield power that does not allow you to dash, and practice the blocking manouver on smaller enemies beforehand so you get it figured out before you actually need it.\n\nAt the end of the day, what's going to decide it for you with this title is if you like magic or not. I play a spellcaster in nearly every RPG i get that allows me to, so I'm very biased towards games that glorify the class. I liked Battlemage quite a bit, even if it was a bit frustrating at times.\nI'll definitely keep an eye out for a sequel, if they ever make one, to see if they iron out the issues this one had. In the meantime, if you can handle the steep learning curve and actively seek variation to combat the repetetiveness, then you could definitely do a lot worse than this game.\n\nYou should probably wait until a sale, though :)","April 18","true","24.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

Begins to be boring as times go and you see that all you have to do is:\nHit with one spell\nSwitch to other spell\nBlink\nKill\nRinse and Repeat.\nStoryA great evil rises and you're the chosen one to stop it with your scout companion that obviously going to die at some point\n\nCliche, skippable and uninteresting. Don't bother with it.\n\nGameplayRanges from too easy from unfair. And by unfair I mean enormous soak sponge enemies with tons of HP and willl totally never hit you. But can offer pretty interesting challenges sometimes.\n\nCrafting is a bit too complicated until you understand it. Takes a few looks at the tutorials to fully understand it. Once you craft your main spells you'll never use it again, since smart inventory upgrades your spells automatically for you.\n\nSave points are another problem. Often too close to each other to not care or so far that it makes you afraid to die and repeat the stage all over again.\n\nPerformanceWhile it sure plays smoothly when it can, it does offer a fair amount of framerate drops and crashes. All I can offer as advice is: Keep your nvidia driver updated or it will surely give you a bad experience with crashing. (At least on my case).\n\nVerdict6.5/10.\n\nSweet graphics, nice explosions and the true feeling of being a one shotter mage, but it can be a serious let down to someone who simply can't learn the crafting, people looking for a more "rpg" feeling or someone gets bored too soon with the combat.\n\nIts fun for a one-run play.

Do not let "Pre-Alpha" scare you off, I've bought games from steam in beta that were less well put together than this.\n\nI've bought alot of Alpha games on Steam and been disappointed - this game has vindicated all of those purchases. The game is beautiful, the mechanics are solid, and the RPG elements (spell crafting from dropped mats, multiple spell schools, spell challenges that allow you to upgrade said schools) are interesting and engaging. I've played AAA titles that would have a hard time stacking up to this game in its Pre-alpha form - it's a steal for 20 dollars, and if you were even slightly interested in any of the video's, you'd be foolish to not pick it up now.\n\nI had originally intended to list some cons to the game, only to realize I haven't found any worth mentioning yet. The games crafting and spell specifics could use a little more explanation, but seeing as the game isn't complete yet, I feel extremely comfortable assuming they'll be there by release due to the high quality just oozing from the game in its current form.

The controls were easy to get and work well. The  magic is standerd fire, ice, and so on, but the ways you use them are new and inovative, yet not unfermilier to players of games like Skyrim. The visuals are easly compaired to Skyrim also, but seem of a bit less quality.\n\nOn the downside, The game is far to linier for me. I often found myself going down what looked like a different path, but to my disapointment it was a dead end and just to make the game look nateral. Being a game about magic, it makes sence that magic is the main weapon of the game. However, it is agrivating to not have a close range attack. Because I didn't have a sword or dagger, my only tactic was to hit enemys while backing up. The tactic gets repeditive very early on.\n\nAll in all Battlemage is a good game, but I found myself wanting to play Skyrim enstead.

It's going to brutalize your spirit the same as Demon Souls or Dark Souls ever did.\n\nThat being said, the game has a linear, moderate difficulty, story path to start, but there are added side paths that add much more of a challenge to the game. That is, if you don't just follow the way your quest marker tells you to go.\n\nThe game supports a couple of different playstyles, up-close and personal with timed attack blocking or ranged and kiting. However, when you act like a sissy, you get sissy enemies. They get confused and can seemingly leash in some cases if you backpedal repeatedly. It is possible to use your spells to interact with some objects of the game world.\n\nThe spell system isn't difficult to understand, you are allowed 4 of the 8 planned schools of magic the devs have planned. It allows for some interesting mix up of combat casting. Spell crafting is interesting, based on the spell items found off enemies and world objects, configure and augment your spells to suit your playstyle. However, the spell animations aren't as awesome as most would like them.\n\nThe game world is beautiful, very detailed, no problems or glitches running on maximum settings, obviously that will differ player to player.

It's one of those "we're gonna need subtitles" games. to make matters worse, the voice acting is so out of place I genuinely believe they tried to make it that way. its clear the intent was to make the characters relatable by their voice acting (god forbid they try giving them any actual character), but placing actors, phrases and terminology that comes from this day and age in a game that is principally designed to provide a fantasy atmosphere (and do absolutely nothing else) is borderline stupid.\nNext up, graphics. this is the big one.\nso clearly, now that we know that the game has no substance there's only two things it could be: a game-mechanic experiment or a graphical sandbox with obligatory linear storyline. or both, in this case.\nNow I will admit, the graphics on the game are throroughly worked through and incredibly high detail. unfortunately there isn't a computer on the planet capable of handling how poorly the game is optimized, and thusly, if you are intending on playing this game on maximum graphics with your Rift, you'd better get ready for an FPS that's measured in decimal numbers. The game is bearable on medium difficulty, and thats on a higher-end rig, and even then, theres stuttering. in short, the grapics are as great as they say, but you won't be able to actually play the game on those graphics.\nAND THE FINAL AND MOST IMPORTANT TOPIC OF THE REVIEW\nGAMEPLAY\nBECAUSE THATS WHY YOU LIKED THIS RIGHT?\nwell guess what buddy?\nits nowhere near as spectacular as I would have liked for my "Groundbreaking super-mage game"\nin my early access review I stressed the point that a vast majority of the spell Sigils/Elements are Identical in operation: one ball spell, one shield spell, one AoE, and a Blink. In the updates they did change the order of the elements, and they did actually give some of them different utilities (even if this makes some of them far too niche to be practical in 99% of battles) the frost spell is now an actual beam of frost that actually freezes enemies, rather than "fireball with a frost skin".\nwhile this is a benefit, the fireball still trumps the utility of all, and you really have to upgrade the other spells massively in proportion if you want to use them (in which case, why not just upgrade fire and one-hit everything, or should I say continue to do so) DOminant strategy is still rife in the game, I found. On top of that, the blink is still broken, meaning that you can't perform the attack as advertised within the game, as it doesn't account for holding the spacebar AT ALL.\nFinally, crafting spells: the other cornerstone of the game.\nin the E-Acc review, I mentioned that the ability to craft from inventory was debuggy, which is expected in early access. however it was introduced to the player early enough for them to experiment with it as a gameplay element.\nThree levels In on this playthrough and I still haven't been given any indication whatsoever that crafting even exists in the game anymore, aside from all the components, sigil level notifications and the tutorial (which explicitly ignores how to get to the crafting menu).\n♥♥♥♥ing. useless.\n\nIn summary, the game has improved from Early Access, but you can't polish a turd, and thats as much consideration as you should give to Lichdom Battlemage","July 9, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I will split this up into several parts:\n\nFor those thinking of buying the game:This game has a great idea behind it; being a mage without the constraints of a mana-bar. That being said, the game itself has little content thus far. If you are looking for a game that you can enjoy and put hours into right now, I recommend buying an elderscrolls game and modding in infinite magika. But if you want to see this game become something great and you don't mind waiting, than by all means purchase it!\n\nThe nifty stuff:The game is gorgeous. The game has a beautiful design whether it be the cave systems or the city streets, I have played plenty of games that lack the natural feel of the surroundings. As of the most recent update there are now voices, which sound very good.\n\nThe not-so-nifty stuff:When I first purchased this game I couldn't get the game to load up to the menu without my CPU maxing out and my PC crashing. I have a decent build, so the reason was just the game not being optimized at all. This frustrated me, since I payed for it and I couldn't even admire the menu screen...\nOnce I actually got it running, the first thing I noticed was that the character animation was off slightly, however, after the update that was fixed. I also noticed the controls sometimes bug out and I end up walking into enemies. Also there is no jump, and the warp cannot go up, not even a little bit. I mean, I tried warping up hill and I didn't move, I tried warping downhill and that worked fine, just no up.\n\nOverall:The game has potential, it is super linear, but the story isn't bad. For now I will stick to playing elder scrolls games with a infinite mana mod, since this game doesn't yet have very many spells. The gameplay is tedious and repetitive. There is no real reward for playing the game again. Also, the archers are the most over powered things in the game... DO NOT get shot by them, you die from only like 3 arrows (exaggerated). The game developers and it's community are kind, so that makes it a bit better. The spells feel right when being cast, and I think that is important, that they feel sort of "heavy", and they do. So the game will get better and probably be worth playing later on.","June 17, 2014","true","18.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

As an alpha it is great so this review is subject to change.  The Story, seems sort of..well strange to me, vengence, got it, simple and effective.  Gameplay... the unlimited magic is nice, but the game is not really challenging, I can literally drink coffee teleport randomly around the battle field, the enemy can never catch up to hit me, nor can there spells/ arrows and what not, and I just shoot lighting at the enemy which is easy to do since it auto aims for me most of the time, though sometimes it just completely misses my target and autoaims into an enemy behind a wall....\nOne Gripe I had, is the lack of a jump button, now some may say, what do you need a jump button for when you can dash move... well there are places some hidden with treats, that you have to jump a small stone (that you can reaslisticly just step over) or a Bannister to stairs that is broken, that you would be able to jump over, but instead have to go all the way around it to get there... hopefully they add a jump button, as the lack of a jump button is just there to test the mapping of the game and the levels with out the quick bypass.  We can customize spells and such... but how about armor?  is there ever going to be anything else other than my hands glowin on the screen with the associated elemental powers (i.e. red= fire, blue = ice, white = lightning...etc)  as Alpha level graphics it looks good, but My skyrim with mods looks a whole lot better, I can imagine they will upgrade this to when the game is in a more finished level.

This is their first game and yet AAA graphics, even in pre-alpha. There are some cons: The game is extremely linear and has very little replay value, and runs at very low framerates due to poor optimisation, but im sure that Xaviant will fix most of these problems, and the pros outweigh the cons. The combat in this game is engaging and very challenging, while, as a result of the lack of cooldowns, a mana bar, and your classical mage-like squishyness, still let you feel like a total badass god of the elements. One thing that this game needs is a co-op mode. Not yet, finish the singleplayer WELL first, but when they are done, Xaviant should definitely release a 4-player co-op mode so players can enjoy it with friends.

That being said, the game does still need a lot of work, which you obviously already know since this was an early access download.\n\nFirstly, and as a general idea throughout the game, you need to add more diversity to virtually every aspect of the gameplay. For example, the system you use for the spell trees, interesting idea but lacks complexity. Despite the fact that you have four separate spell trees, (fire, ice, corruption, and delerium) you only gave the character three spells...shoot, block, and Aoe. Furthermore, to my knowledge, there is no difference in the spell resistances of all the enemies, i.e. they are all equally vulnerable to all the spell schools. As result, this system negates the need for multiple spell schools and discourages the player from ever swapping between them, with the exception of utilizing the different AoE effects you get when using the blink ability. I recommend branching out and diversifying the players spell portfolio.\n\nNext, I feel that the progression of the enemy difficuly and the progression of the character's skill are out of sync. What I mean by that is that the enemies get tougher faster than the character gets stronger, which creates two problems. First, it slows down the game pace, because it starts taking what seems like 30 spell casts on each enemy to finally kill them so a handful of enemy peons can take 20 minutes to kill while the player is "kiting" them around in circles. Second, it robs the player of the experience of being an all-powerful mage. In every game with multiple class choices that I can think of, the magical classes (aside from healers) are the "glass cannons" of the game, basically a bit squishier than the other classes but they compensate for dealing outstanding damage that other classes can't hope to compete with. By admition of one of the creator's of the game in a gameplay trailer, the idea behind this game's creation is to let the player experience the power of a DPS class like the mage "without the shackles that are always being put on them to keep them from being overpowered compared to the other classes." In short, you should give serious consideration to pumping up the DPS output of the mage to nuclear levels, and adjusting the player/enemy progression so that they scale together more appropriately. You can do so without worrying about making the game too easy by adding more enemies, as well as more bosses and mini-bosses. In this way, the players can get their kicks by plowing through tons of trash mobs with ease and the satisfaction of seeing big damage numbers ticking over the heads of their enemies, then presenting them with significant challenges during all the boss fights. This brings me to the next subject...\n\nThe custom spell creation and synthesizing systems are an excellent edition to the game, keep it, but again I recommend adding more complexity to it. Always the same three choices, shoot, barrier, or AoE. Being able to add properties like crit chance and extra damage through augments is a good start, but as I said, it's still always the same three choices, (offense, defense, AoE). I suggest you expand into sub-categories. Single-target spells, multiple lock-on targeting spells, knockback spells, stuns, snares, healing, summoning, damage over time spells personal buffs, the list goes on and on, there's a lot of room to expand here. This is essentially the first game in its class, a whole new genre, which means you get to write the rules and boundaries however you want, so get creative with it. How about adding distinct advantages for each spell class. Maybe when you use fire spells you have increased speed and damage, whereas with ice every spell slows your enemies but you yourself are also slower and maybe less resistant to damage because your cold and brittle like ice. Furthermore, I recommend you get rid of the corruption spell tree all together and replace it with something better. Corruption and Delerium schools are too similar to ever need, want, or use both, and as long as the player only needs one affliction style, delirium is vastly superior to corruption. Maybe exchange corruption for arcane, after all, what kind of mage doesn't use arcane magics.\n\nAlso, Barrier and shield are different, but similar enough to make barrier seem like a placeholder spell. Especially because it's completely unecessary to have a seperate barrier spell for each different school of magic yet each barrier does exactly the same thing with no class related benefits. Consider merging the two together. Barrier aspect being the active side of the ability and the shield benefits being a passive "side-effect." In the spell assigning page in the players inventory, put the barrier spell where you currently have the shield placed, and when creating a barrier spell, simply add shield health into the properties improved by augments, (example: let either mastery, or control increase shield health). Also consider adding a mechaninc so that a barrier can reduce incoming damage by more than 50% if the player wanted to make a stronger barrier. If necessary you can omit some of theless useful augmentable properties like extra blink distance. Extra blink distance could be advantageous but not practical if you must choose it over all the other, more useful addons..\n\nOne last thing. randomized results of the synthesis system could be fine tuned a bit. A bit more predictability/consistency in the results of synthesis would be good. I recommend a system more like the possessed weapon crafting system from the game Darksiders 2. Where the player can choose the properties they want to have on the item they craft, based on all of the properties that were on the materials they used in the synthesis process. That way the players can customize their mage more appropriately with their playstyle, thus providing a more unique experience for every player, and also making the game more suitable for people to play more than once. each time they play through the game they can "create" a different kind of mage and enjoy a different play style.\n\nAnyway, thanks for taking the time to read my suggestions, I hope they are useful for you guys. and I can't wait to see the game as a finished product. Good luck.","April 10, 2014","true","129.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/261760/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","This game ran horribly even on the lowest possible settings with a evga gtx 680 ftw+ 4gb, a card that could run all games on high and a lot on ultra. Even now with a evga gtx 970 ftw which kills any game I throw at it on full ultra, it still can't be run on max settings. I can max everything and tune down some things from ultra to just high and it runs at 60fps mostly but yet still has slowdown from time to time. So even with a card that murders every game I throw at it I am constantly tweaking in this game to keep it running smooth rather than just simply enjoying it without worry. I thought Ubisoft were the kings of unoptimized games but this company has them beat by a mile. This is without a shadow of a doubt the worst optimized and/or coded game I have ever seen. However with my 970 the game, with tweaking/experimenting, runs pretty smooth now to a point of I can play now and just enjoy it and stay out of the video options. But what do they expect people to do, buy sli 980's for a thousand dollars just to run this game at max settings? lol. I highly doubt even that could handle it because of the game's coding.\n\nSo that lets me give it a honest fair review now. So then what makes this game so special that it requires a hefty newer-gen gpu to run it smoothly at max/near max settings? As far as the quality of the gameplay goes, nothing. Just bad optimization and/or coding, that's it, that's what sets it apart from a game that is on the other hand coded much better. There is nothing special whatsoever about this game that makes it deserve to sit atop a mound of far superior games in terms of graphical requirements. If Half-Life 3 pulled this, then it would be acceptable because we all know that game is going to be amazing. But Valve wouldn't do that because they know how to make games right. "Oh but our special particles and effects are really demanding." How about this: don't have killer special effects if the game is overall pretty mediocre.\n\nI am running the game at 60fps and to be fair it does look decent. I wouldn't know what the spell effects are like on ultra because I have to play them one step lower, which is fine I'm not really complaining. The effects are gorgeous and that is about the extent to the hype of this game's graphics. Everything else is nothing special. The problem is that nothing is very memorable because the levels are pretty linear looking and bland and the enemies are pretty standard fair in terms of their design, like mostly skeletons and human enemies. It also has another staple of many bad games: often poor checkpointing. The boss fights are also not hard at all, rather extremely long endurance tests. Each boss fight consists of a boss with about ten times too much hp than he should have, making each boss fight around 10-15 minutes of throwing spells, dodging, spells, dodging, over and over again. True endurance tests indeed. If you get bored or tired of the same old ♥♥♥♥ repeating itself over and over in that 10-20 minute fight and you die, you have to do it all over again, the whole boss fight over again lol. Just like this game's crafting system, the boss fights are very ill conceived.\n\nDon't misunderstand me, this is not a truly bad game in its own right, but when you compare it to the dozens upon dozens of other choices out there for fps games, it can't compete. The whole gimmick of limitless mana is pretty cool for a little while but loses its charm quickly. I used to play WoW and always wondered what it would be like to play my mage without mana restrictions. Turns out it really wasn't as good of an idea as I had always hoped. The game's crafting system is easily one of the most ill conceived crafting systems I have ever seen. It gives you a few tips then throws you in the deep end without any further explanation. So far I have noticed it doesn't matter anyway. No matter what spell I craft of what quality, only a few stats barely change and basically the only real difference in spells when crafting is their effects. There is a smart inventory option that lets you upgrade what you have, but I still have no idea how custom spell crafting works. But they all still look identical anyway, just maybe cast a little differently with a lob affect versus a straight fireball. If you've cast one fire spell, you've cast them all. The God awful crafting system should have just been left out in favor of a much better tried and true rpg character progression system. Besides the mind numbing repetitive moving backwards while spell spamming and linear levels, the crafting system is one of the worst parts of the game. In terms of difficulty, the game is all over the place. Sometimes I get one-shotted, sometimes I don't. The game constantly slaps you on the hand as if to say "no, you are playing wrong". But there is no "wrong" just a randomness combined with luck on whether or not you will be repeating entire sections and multiple long fight sequences because of p-ss poor checkpointing, some of the worst there is in any game.\n\nFor courtesy to the reader I can shorten up what the whole experience of this game is from beginning to end: traverse very linear levels and spam a few spells over, and over, and over again while walking/dodging backwards to avoid being hit, ad nauseam. Had I not own so many amazing fps games and just had this to enjoy, I would be fair in giving it a 6 maybe 6.5 out of 10 and a thumbs up. But unfortunately for this game the competition is pretty stiff, like a 18yr old me on prom night.\n\n5.5/10. Catch it on sale for $10 or less, preferably closer to $5 in the future if it ever goes that cheap, if not don't worry about it because you aren't missing anything special, and judge for yourself because chances are you might find it a point or two more enjoyable than I have.","April 25, 2015","false","7.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There are other good games out there like Magicka, but Lichdom feels different and better. Maybe it’s something about the first person perspective, I’m not entirely sure. I’ve gone back and forth on this game as to why it’s so good and where the difficulty actually lies in it. I’ll try to elaborate for you guys.\n\nThe difficulty in Lichdom is hard to pin down. It’s not that it’s terribly difficult, but it can be if you end up making the game harder on yourself. This all revolves around your spells of choice. You’ll have more choices then you’ll need when it comes to classes of magic here. By all means, pick anything you’d like. The early game is easy and lets you get a feel for how it all handles. Then, sometime later in the game there is a bit of a difficulty barrier.\n\nThat point in Lichdom is when you will you’ll need stronger or more well crafted spells. There’s a basic crafting tutorial in-game, but most information can be found outside of the game proper. While this works with most games, this time it doesn’t jive well with me. There are some really cool combinations you can create when crafting and there are some really crappy ones. You can be busy exploring your options and end up screwing yourself over by having spells that will only add up and/or store damage and not have one that deals the direct damage to unleash all that you’ve setup. (I know it takes a special kind of someone, but I am speaking from experience here.) There is a lot of combinations to work with. You seriously need to pay attention when the in-game tutorials pop-up or do some extracurricular reading to get those awesome spells to work out for you. Unfortunately, I haven’t found a guide on making specific spell combinations to be really freaking awesome… I’d like one… a lot. I’m not 100% on how it would work, but something like: find these components and put them together like thus to make X spell. That or a guide on how to get my freaking Undead Hulk from Necromancy and Delirium.\n\nOn the other hand, you could pick up Necromancy and call it good. It’s definitely not as shiny as well… any other spell class, but it does make things worlds easier. When you kill something with a Necromancy mark on it, that will summon an undead minion to your side and it will fight for you. This is too freaking useful to pass up for first-timers who may like a challenge, but don’t want to get too frustrated. It’s not a cake-walk, but it’s a lot nicer if you’ve got the patience to back it up. I’ve beaten a few of the challenge levels/instances (marked by these artifacts that look like ancient green laser pointers) on my first try with Necromancy where it would have taken me maybe four to five tries with other spell combinations up to not being able to finish them at all.\n\nSince I’ve found my groove with Necromancy, the difficulty isn’t much of a gripe. My main gripe with Lichdom is in how the game “feels”. I really enjoy it in a general sense: the spells, the power and the story that makes you want to punch that weasel of a villain in his mustache. Also, I like the first person perspective too! It’s just that the game is so linear. I’m usually the guy that loves a good ‘ol linear game too. The story drives the game well and there’s enough to explore and find on your way so that’s not really the issue. I think it’s the fact that you’re playing a mage… and that’s usually in RPGs… and lately those have been more open. This doesn’t reduce the fun had at all, but there is a tiny lingering thought in the back of my head most of the time wanting to not be constrained to a path that only really arches if there is a side-challenge to be had. The guys at Xaviant are trying to establish an I.P. so they are just laying the groundwork here.\n\nI really hope Lichdom has done well because I cannot wait to see what else they’ve got up their sleeves the next time they put out a game. This was a great concept for a game and with this much work done already on the systems and lore, can you imagine what the next game would be like? I hope they don’t make the main focus as a versus multiplayer experience, but I would love a two player (at least) coop experience. It’d be sweet to be setting up and making things explode with a friend! I’m reaching out to see if they have any plans for a sequel.\n\nEDIT: Xaviant got back to me and Lichdom did well enough to warrant a sequel! There is no comment on how soon we’ll see it, but the fact that it is in the works is awesome. Great job guys!\n\nScore: Gewd.\n\nLichdom has everything you would expect from a AAA game while not being made by a AAA company (kudos to Xaviant for that!) The graphics are amazing, the controls are good, they’ve got a well implemented crafting system all while the story keeps you playing because it’s actually interesting. (I love revenge in my games more than my movies.) It feels very linear because it is, but this is one of the best ways to tell a story and not have you get too lost. There is also no multiplayer, but they are laying the groundwork for an I.P. so it’s forgivable (read as: get over it). It’s easy for me to do because I’m still one of those guys that misses my longer that three hour campaigns in my shooters. Also, it’s better to have a solid single player campaign than an almost finished one with a tacked on multiplayer. It’s only natural to have a game make you feel completely B.A. and want to flaunt your powers in front of your buds while destroying them or helping them destroy another team. We’ll just have to be patient is all. Over all, Lichdom: Battlemage is completely worth the money if you want a game that treats the mage like you feel they should. (Next time let me jump though.)","December 18, 2014","true","27.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It gives you a very large and highly customizable toolset that allows you to be an incredibly powerful battlemage in lots of very intense combat situations that really keep you on your toes. If you don't make use of your entire arsenal, or if you let your concentration lapse, you will fail quickly. But if you do it right, you are every bit as badass as advertized.\n\nThe latest "Use your tools" video is I think a pretty accurate description of the reviews you see here and elsewhere. Most negative reviewers find themselves fleeing around the battlefield charging up their fireball spell and spamming it at the enemy, Whenever I find myself casting a fireball more than 3 times in a row, I wake up to the fact that I'm a badass battlemage and then I go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and destroy everything and anything in my path.\n\nThe combat is great and versatile. You'll need strong situational awareness to make sure you're targeting the enemies that need to die asap and that you're crowd controlling whatever you're not killing so you don't get overwhelmed. You've got both targeted and AoE spells to freeze, stun, DoT, burn, explode, you name it, and you can always decide to let the enemy attack so you can go for a timed shield block and nova the entire area.\n\nCustomization is strong, with lots of options to tune your loadout to your liking depending on whether you prefer to go for a freeze + destroy build, a slow + bleed build or any other style you can think of that synergizes well together. You'll need to figure out a well balanced set of spells to use, not just stack up destruction-only spells and hope you won't get your face smashed in.\n\nThe story so far isn't very special. It's very black and white but I've never needed an excuse to be a badass before.\n\nThe crafting is in-depth, but my one gripe is that the menus don't really support the huge number of items and variety that the game has. It's a little hard to know whether this item you're looking at could be best recycled or used in a spell somewhere, simply because the list of options is so large that only a tiny set is on-screen at a time.\n\nLevel design is fairly predictable (oh look, a combat arena type of space, I wonder if there will be enemy spawns) but the combat arenas are well balanced and the visuals aren't terrible. They're not too special but they don't detract from the experience at all.\nSpell visuals are great and you feel really powerful vaporizing groups of enemies at a time.","April 3, 2015","true","17.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Did this 2 times already. Some day I will get this game finished, but I dont know when.\n\nBeside beside being a challenging game, there is nothing that stimulate you, to finish it.\n\nThe pros:\n- very good looking grafics\n- simple to understand controls\n- learning from mistakes actually keeps you going\n- adapting to enemy behavior changes whole fights\n\nThe cons:\n- completely linear levels\n- boring bossfights (only encountered the first)\n- boring fighting mechanics\n- boring fighting animations\n- stupid hopping around and kiting enemys all day long\n- unpredictable enemy behavior (you have a block-counter attack ability, but you cant actually predict how long an enemy takes to hit you, so often waste time with this)\n- total confusing crafting system\n- confusing overall interface\n- each of your items has a ton of stats and numbers on it, but beside damage and health I never understood any of them\n- not enough tooltipps\n- no item tutorial which teach you the item stats\n- no free choosing of your damage type at the start of the game-engine\n- save points\n- the whole saving system (never knew if I actually saved if I quit the game)\n- crafting system\n\nSimply the whole game is a big confusion. I played a lot of complicated games, seldom used tutorials and always learned really fast how to use all features to my best advantage. But in most of the games, learning new stuff is fun!\nIn this game, it is frustrating, confusing and overall doesnt feel right. Its like forced learning a school topic you really dont like.\n\nLichdom calls you a mighty battle mage. You dont! You always have to run away, run in circles, walk backwards, blink, blink more and most of all...why the ... is your blinking ability only forward, while 90% of your combat movement is backwards. Have they even played their own game?\n\nNo cooldowns. And why cant I use my blink as often as I like?\n\nUsing spells like cooking a soup. First you dot them, then you dot them, then, when they start pulsating, you blast them away with a damage attack. While having normal attack powers, a big part of the game is about spell combos, that marks enemys with debuffs, so if you finally hit them with your damage spell, they get impressive bonus damage and instantly explode with great amount of overdamage that actually activate synergy attacks. I dont know what that is, because I never manage to activate such a thing. Like that, every combat is a big quick time event, where you always have to do the same thing. No combat tactics, no cover, no use of terrain.\n\nLast and I think least, the developers are really in love with themselves, which is the worst, that can happen to a creative mind. Never loose the ability to criticize your own work, or taking critics.\nWhen I opened a thread about the dull combat and bloated crafting system, they told me (and others) like "go back playing COD if you dont like this". Thanks a lot. Never played COD. I played good RPG games like NwN and good RTS like SC and AoE. Your game can be as challenging as it want, as long as it bores me to hell, I wont be able to finish it.","December 10, 2014","false","6.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The primary promise of the developers, to break away from the the typical, "wizards are fragile" paradigm is a really appealing one, and frankly, far more in line with most of the popular fantasty stories out there.\n\nBut, Lichdom:  Battle mage doesn't deliver the fantasy of a powerful battlemage, as promised.  The biggest reason for this is that enemies absorb too much damage before going down.  How am I to believe that I am a baddass when random moster x takes three hits from my fire spell before going down.  Have you ever played a FPS, scored a headshot on a human, with a .50 caliber rifle, and then watched him return fire?  It feels silly, and that was how a great deal of this game felt for me.\n\nI am pretty sure that the shield system is supposed to make you feel more powerful, by giving you an alternative to retreating from enemies while you charge a spell, but the feedback from that style of spell is poor, and so it is difficult to know when you are "doing it right."\n\nThe result for me, is that I found myself giving up on the shield system and just back pedaling from monsters as I tossed (too many) spells at them until they dropped.  This was tedious, and made and certainly did not make me feel like the badass spellslinger that I thought I was going to be.\n\nOther issues are also frequent.  The game does not seem to be well optimized in terms of performance.  I find that my system chugs while playing this game, wheras I can play other, more graphically intense games with no trouble.\n\nThe gameplay starts to feel reptitive, as while there ARE technically thousands upon thousands of spells to create, most of them are just minor variations on each other.  This fire spell has a bigger area, this one burns for longer, that one has a stronger impact, et cetera.  There is little motivation to create lots of varied spells, as most enemies can be approached in exactly the same way.  Hence the tedium.\n\n","December 19, 2015","false","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Once you realise how much the spell-creating system actually limits you it gets repetitive. Example: You can very early create an ice-spell that freezes enemies. You can also very early create a lightning-spell that chains to enemies. You can never create an ice-chain-freezing spell, let alone something that combines both elements.\n\nSo after 7 hours in the fun mainly comes from trying out new spells or to get apocalyptic- or synergies-effects. The rules by which these effects appear aren't written down clearly anywhere. Aside from that it's really just "get some numbers higher".You can also only have 3 active "elements" (sigils) at once. No clue why they limited that. Together with the inventory it looks like the game was made to be played with a controller, but that's fine. K/M works very well. Graphics are nice. They tried to make the story interesting, kudos for that. I really liked the "cinematics": http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=412410660\n\nMy last death was very unfair. A miniboss-monster with a stunning-aura ran past my necro-creeps and basically perma-stunned me just by being close to me, that also dealed damage. From full health to zero in 4 seconds without the ability to do anything. There are some really stupid design-flaws in this game. Not sure at this ponit (7 hours played) if I will finish it.\n\nIt's worth to check it out. It's extremely cheap anyway. that's why I'm recommending it, but eventually you will get bored of it.","March 27","true","7.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

They took a very new concept of both FPS and RPG and merged them in a very unique way. Bravo to the developers. The game is diverse enough to allow you to change your character and adapt for new roles on the fly. Even with this limitless power, you have to make strong decisions on what you craft and how you use it. Even a simple battle can feel rewarding when you snare the enemies in you magic and defeat them with out ever being touched.\n\nThe story is my only issue. It is pretty hollow. However, the original Borderlands was as well and look how that turned out. I can easily compare this game to Borderlands. The developer took a risk with random generation in an action RPG and it paid off BIG.\n\nCharacter creation has a lot of trial and error, but even bad spells can make for interesting combat. Nothing is useless. Sometimes you have to adapt, somtimes you need to change. It's all up to the player.\n\nI recommend this game.\n\nIf you want to see some gameplay, check out my YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTMDqBlbIF7n9rXVOM3Griw\n\n~Mattmon\nThe Frigid Gamer","September 4, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I bought this game a while back when it much cheaper, I think when it was still beta, I can't remember exactly - ANYWAY\n\nI had a lot of fun with this game untill I recently reached a point in the game I can only describe as unbalanced. The game was going pretty good for me up untill this point, the graphics are pretty good, the spell effects are nice, the crafting mechanic is fun and varied (once you learn how to use it which admittedly could use more explaination game wise) and all the different "sigils" or spell types are fairly unique. The combat was to a degree repetitive, the game is very linear, but I still really enjoyed the combat and mixing up different spell combos and figuring out how different sigils interact together, crafting spells that fit each one etc.\n\nThe story is another well... story, its... probably not the worst story ever, but certainly nothing to praise, the characters are not too interesting, the story's not any better, the voice acting meh. probably one of the games weaker points. I was not capitivated by any part of the narrative, and I'm someone who can appreciate a good story. This is not a game one plays for the narrative is all I'm sayin'. You can probably figure out if the combat portion is for you by reading my and others reviews, and if it doesn't sound like you'd love it, you'll probably hate this game.\n\nDespite all that I still thoroughly enjoyed my experience, I was just playing on the default difficulty lvl 3/4 I believe, and for the most part having a grand ol' time blasting enemies away with my spells. I managed not to die (except for one time i slipped into water and drowned, oops) untill I reach this big boss, now this boss killed me probably around 8 times and ate over an hour of my life. If I was looking for this kind of excruciating frustration, I would've bought Dark Souls. Keep in mind this game has been for the most part easy to slighly challanging up untill this point (which is generally the kind of experience I look for in a game) so I was quite taken aback at how drastically different the difficulty was. It was like someone turned the amp from a 4 to 11, I honestly think this is a fairly big flaw in the game, something of a balance issue, since even if you like getting your guts ripped out your ♥♥♥ and handed to you on your tibia, youd have to mow your way through around 9 hours of squishy punching bags. I take no problem with games that demand alot from their players, I admire the Souls fans, but a game that goes 0 to 100 (real quick) with no warning like this is simply flawed. Myabe i'll return tomorrow and swallow my pride and just lower my difficulty, or maybe i'll just buy Dark souls finally, or maybe i'll just shoot myself, I don't know which yet, but I WONT recommend this game unfortunately, despite its many good aspects. I personally feel that this game came close to being a good game, but didn't quite make the cut.","March 31","false","12.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For a game that prides itself on "Makeing a Mage the badass" you start out as some grease stain nobody whos girlfriend(boyfriend) is killed and now some wierdo in a robe gives you magic bracers. Your not a student of the arcane who spent years reading through ancient tomes to learn how to throw just one tiny spark of fire across a room or a knowledge theif who broke into a wizards library and too their secrets for your own. Nope you are just some idiot that got themselves killed and now has magic handed to them.\n\nRight off your not so much a mage as you are a dude who throws a few fireballs around. The second problem I ran into is that some of the game controls do not work as described in the tutorial videos(which themselves are disruptive to gameplay). The game tells you to hold down space while targeting to do a combo slide spell attack. This never worked for me after several minuets of trying all different combinations of the controls. The game also tells you that you can attune different elements to change how they fire but does not explain how to actually do this. It seems like something that is suppose to open up later in the game leaving me confused as to why it is brought up at all.\n\nThe game boasts being able to mix and match magic but right away you are locked into only using fire or ice and have to cycle between them. Trying to adjust this at one of the waypoints(the only place you can make changes apparently) the slots are all locked at the begining. Some master magicial huh?\n\nThese issues might be forgivable if the gameplay felt at all exciting or interesting. The few levels I played where all linear rail shooters designs with really predictable enemie A.I. In fact old school rail shooters like Serious Sam, Duke Nukem, and Doom have more inspired and open world designs despite being graphically dated. Additionally the 3 shield health system is an unessary break up of a normal health bar into 3 arbitrary bars. If they regenerated over time or gave you more power the fewer bars you have it might make it meaningful. Maybe this happens later in the game but I couldn't be bothered to struggle through many boring levels to get there.\n\nAnd to everyone out there who thinks I was not paying attention or just didnt give the game enough of a chance to figure thigs out the truth is the game didn't hold my interest enought for me to care to dive deeper and learn more. Also reading other reviews it looks like the gameplay stays the same throughout and you MUST have mastery equiped to a spell to even make it worth using.\n\nTLDR: I felt like more of a badass master mage plaing Darksouls and Magica.","June 17, 2015","false","0.9"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","0"

It takes a few hours to get used to the fighting mechanics and what your preferred style of playing will be.

Just make sure you have a system that can handle this game. It was built using the Crysis Engine, so if you are someone who NEEDS to play games on the highest visual levels, but don't have a TRUE high end system, be prepared to lower some video settings my friend.

The world is fantastic in style and meticulous in its detail. The lore is interesting, as it's full of darkness and putrid practices. The gameplay is quick and requires a large amount of thinking on your feet with the 3 spell sigils (9 spells in all) you are allowed to equip at once. However that's not so say it stands without fault, as it has it's fair share of problems.\nThe founder and CEO of the company says in a cutscene that you should feel like a 'total bad ♥♥♥' when you figure out how to effectively use the spell system. I have indeed done that, and I don't feel like a bad ♥♥♥. The problem here is not from the spells themselves but from enemies having WAY too much health. There is a boss at the end of the first level which is the big hulking thing (I'm not going to give too much away) that's interesting and intimadating to fight - for the first 10 mins... I actually had to get up and take a break from the game it was such an overlong fight. Not only that but there's some chick (or some guy depending on your chosen player character) thats just standing on a ledge somewhere yelling "Kill it! Kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!" Why can't she help? Why is she standing there repeating the SAME FIVE LINES as I try to solo the huge lumbering damage sponge I've been kiting around for the last 20 mins? That was annoying.\nAlso there are places to regain your health by holding F. You have to hold F for a second or two, wich is a longish time in a game this fast, so while you're regaining health after a long battle you'll get suckerpunched in the face by something that spawned behind you. Once I was watching a cutscene and enemies spawned, dragged me away, and killed me. Excuse me for being interested in your lore guys :( .\nThe story is nothing to write home about either. If you choose the male, your wife is killed and you have to avenge her. If you choose the Female, your sister is captured and you have to avenge her. If I wasn't so interested in the lore I would say the story is just uncreative crap. I'm much more invested in what the Cult of Malthus is up to than my wife/sister getting killed.\nRecomending this game is sort of situational. If you want pretty graphics: Yes. If you want interesting and dark lore: Yes. If you want fast paced and complex gameplay: Absolutely. If you want a complex story: No. It has its issues, but I think Lichdom: Battlemage has HUGE potential as a game, even without a compelling story, if the enemies get their health pools nerfed so you can really get that 'bad ♥♥♥' feeling the game tells you it's after.","May 4, 2014","true","7.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsilverblood/recommended/261760/","rsilverblood","raven_silverblood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rsilverblood/","108 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWant to know if you should buy this game? Stop, you violated the law! (Oblivion reference in Lichdom? Yes, please!)\n\nIn all seriousness, hold on for a second. This isn't a final product. You're not buying a finished game when you buy this. It's called "Early Access" for a reason. Yes, it's a game, but it's a work in progress, with special emphasis on the "in progress" part.\n\nFirst, let's adjust the Settings for your Expectations before you make your purchase decision, shall we? (By continuing to read this, you agree. Otherwise, Vine has some cute cat videos you can watch instead. Moving along...)\n\nIf you expect this game to have:\n\n- Finished graphics, nearly no bugs, lots of features, perfect gameplay, flawless AI, balanced mechanics, etc.\n\nThen this isn't the game for you. And also, stop beta-testing and stop alpha-testing. Heck, stop buying "Early Access" games altogether, because you just don't get it. If you're going to buy an "Early Access" title, it's a preview. Alpha and Beta-testing mean you're there to find bugs, give constructive criticism (when needed), positive feedback (if deserved), and detailed/helpful suggestions to help move the game so it ends up as a masterpiece.\n\nThis game isn't just "any old game". It isn't ready for prime-time yet. And that's alright. You're not buying a finished product, you're checking a preview and being able to give better feedback to the developers, so they can make this game so much better than it is now. If you buy this game early on, before final release, don't whine and complain about it, and don't be mad or emotional. You bought a preview of an unfinished game, and you got exactly what you paid for.\n\nIf you aren't willing to put down money now for an unfinished game that isn't perfect, and if you aren't willing to give feedback, constructive criticism, and helpful suggestions, don't buy it. Just wait for the final version, and check some YouTube reviews before buying.\n\nLichdom isn't like any of those other AAA titles you find out there, that give "two weeks beta access" which is just their way of milking more money from their customers and getting free marketing and hype for their game before full release. This is an *actual* game in progress, not a marketing ploy. I know in this day and age we're getting used to the idea of Beta-Access being a way of getting a head start in a AAA game before full release, but Lichdom isn't going for that. They actually *want* (and probably need) your help to find what works, and what doesn't. If you're willing to be part of the solution, join the community, because we need more people like you here (and in general!) to make this game go from good to great.\n\nNow... if you're someone who wants to know what seeing a game in development looks like, if you want to know what beta-testing games is like, and if you want to help shape the future of this game to get the features you want, fix the issues you have with the preview, and be a part of a community that is passionate about creating the ultimate battlemage game you've always wanted, then check out the next part. I'll cover the good, the bad, and the ugly in a moment (best cowboy movie ever reference? or best cowboy movie reference ever?).\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Graphics are amazing, but that's what a CryEngine3 game should be like. (I run it @High Settings with resolution of 1280x1024 using a GTX 650 Ti Boost 2GB, and I get very little fps drop. @Medium settings I get no drop in fps.)\n\n- Great magic system. Simple, lots of damage, great effects, shows a lot of potential for combat.\n\n- The Crafting System is amazing! (Press "I" for "Inventory", and you'll also bring up the Items, Crafting, Equipment, and more areas for your character.)  It isn't perfect, and there's a lot that needs to be fixed before release. But there's so much potential here. If you're willing to put forth both time and effort into offering helpful and detailed suggestions for the developers, then you can help make this game great!\n\n- Monster sounds, soundtrack and in-game environment are *very* immersive - and sometimes terrifying. Play this game in the dark, with surround headsets on, and try playing until a monster spawns right in beside you. Just make sure you have an extra set of undergarments, because you will need to change them.\n\n- Combat is great, natural, flowing, innovative. I may be a gushing fanboy (or I probably sound like it), but it really is great. I love what they've done. Sure, there are some flaws here and there that can be overlooked, and a couple that can't, but it's pretty solid for such an early start, and that potential is why I don't regret buying this game.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- AI gets stuck. Monsters spawn only when you get close to a certain point, and you can easily kite them or get them into a tunnel where you can hit them more easily. It doesn't feel like you're fighting intelligent beings - it feels like you're fighting a simulation, which is 100% immersion-breaking when you cross an invisible line on the ground and monsters start retreaing while you pummel them with fireballs and ice bolts from a distance, or when you keep appearing from behind a corner and the monster sees you and doesn't dodge or blitz to take you down.\n\n- Fire magic is really weak compared to Ice Magic, and isn't really a viable option right now - which is bad since it's selected as your default school of magic, compounded by the lack of Tutorial, and that most keys don't show up the in "Controls" screen in the Options/Settings area of the MainMenu ("Press F1 for Help" after you press "Esc" to get to the GameMenu screen when you start a new game). Besides giving Ice Magic some slow effects and some paralyze (read: freeze) effects, Fire doesn't have much going for it. I'd like to see Fire Magic as powerful as Ice Magic is now, rather than Ice Magic being nerfed so it's more like Fire Magic. (I guess, as a PC enthusiasts, I can't be blamed for always wanting "Moar Pow-ah!" Wait, why is there a forehead-shaped crater on my desk, and why is my forehead bleeding? Let me read my previous rambling and - ouch, that hurt!)\n\n- Barrier spell doesn't work well, and it's very difficult to time-block an attack. The lack of visual indicator to show when the time block starts and ends is a bit frustrating. I found dodging to be the only useful defensive thing. RMB doesn't have much practical use, other than LMB+RMB combo.\n\n- No voice acting. (It isn't a part of the game yet. That's why it's a preview, and not the full release.) Lore isn't immersive, even though it seems like it might be epic. Right now, it feels like we're stuck in the middle of a game and we don't know why things are happening the way they are. It feels like we've been dropped in the first stage after the tutorial, but with no tutorial, no lore, no background, and we're just left to explore and fight for no other reason than to survive.\n\n- Minor graphical shading/lighting bugs, with minor flickering of some objects and textures. Longer-than-desireable loading times. Occasional crashes to desktop.\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n- Long-range damage is very heavy-hitting, and your character has very low health, so he's dead in very hits, with very little regeneration before, during ot after combat (except through items). It sounds nice, but I think I'd prefer something more rewarding, like gaining a bit of health for killing enemies.\n\n- Mini-boss fights have way too much health, and you've pretty much got to kite them all the way, while dodging the ranged and close-quarters attacks from the monsters they summon. There's a lot of grinding involved.\n\n- Lack of tutorial. Although I've added one here on Steam, in the "Guide" tab for this game if you feel like checking it out. If you're new to the game, here's the link: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=241547970\n\n\nConclusion: I loved it and recommend it, no regrets.

This looks like it'll be a great game when finished. The minimum requirements are a bit steep, but with this being pre-Alpha I wouldn't expect anything to be optimized yet. Again with the level design seen here, I wouldn't be surprised if the gameplay here doesn't even show up, or is completely different.\n\nI love the idea of being an aggressive, close-quarters mage. Other games have you feeling like a soldier with a magic gun, using only available spells. This game has you using magic as a dynamic power source, almost as if YOU are the person making the magic with your mind. No choice of applications, just whatever you want to do.\n\nThere are bugs in this game, and I did experience a decent amount of low FPS (although I am running a fairly average 3-yr old system, so that is likely from my end). However, being pre-Alpha, it is to be expected. I'm actually surprised that this isn't just a closed, boring test room with no real background.\n\nIn short, I highly recommend this game. There are rough edges, but that is to be expected for pre-Alpha. I am very excited for what this will be like when just in Beta phase, let alone fully finished.","March 26, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Almost 6 hours straight of this game and I still haven't finished. For $25 this is well worth the price, albiet a few shortcomings.\n\nFirstly, There needs to be more damage-focused spell types. After gaining the first 2 (I'm uncertain of anymore) spell archetypes I STILL only found myself upgrading and using only the fire based spells, as the corruption, albiet cool to use, took too long to efficiently deal with enemies and the other mind-control/rage ability (the name eludes me) didn't seem to do much of anything. Also, enemy health scaling seemed to overstretch how well you can creat new, powerful spells and enemy count once you hit the snow covered town is insanely high and is difficult to compete with, mostly the whip users. Small nitpicking includes sound glitches when too much is going on, very long load times and no voice acting (Yes I understand it is a beta).\n\nNo matter the shortcomings, I have had a great deal of fun with this. Well designed combat areas, varied enemies, well done boss fights, fun and destructive gameplay, beautiful visuals and amazing spell effects give you a very distinc type of immersion and gameplay. The crafting system is relatively simple and easy to use and reagents for new spells and shields are plentiful and varied. The developers have done a great job so far, but of course there is great deal of room for improvements. I recommend this highly to anybody who loves magic focused combat with a very different take on it.","April 19, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There are no cool-downs, no mana potions. Just a limitless well of magical ability, abetted by a unique spell-crafting system, good graphics, great voice-acting, long (occasionally boring) levels, great boss fights, and a serviceable-but-not-special story.\n\nFirst the magic. There are no other weapons. There are nine elements; each can combo with the others in different ways. Only three elements can be equipped at a time, so there are limits. Results can be explosive (like 27,000 points per combo). The spell-crafting system is deep. Guides are a must, but only the most rudimentary tutorials are provided in-game, so prepare to trawl the forums looking for tips. Fortunately, all spell elements have detailed descriptions; you can spend hours in the crafting window, tweaking and building new spells or breaking old ones apart.\n\nUnfortunately, the combat can actually get boring after a while.The enemies are don't vary much from beginning to end; you'll be fighting the same baddies in the final level that you fought in the caves early in the game.  While general level combat is "same-y", bosses offer a lot of variety. Several of them are hard as nails and require strategizing and careful spell-crafting to defeat.\n\nThe path through the game is linear . Arcade levels with massive loot drops hide in caves and corners, so explore throughly. You can only save via checkpoint. Graphics are glorious; it's CryEngine 3, so expect the game to look as good as Crysis 3 (it will also strain your hardware). The voice-acting is superb; Jennifer Hale and Troy Baker have an excellent rapport, presided over by the somber tones of Clancy Brown (remember him from the original Highlander movie?). The story is passable, but after a while I stopped caring.\n\nWhile the repetition wore on me after a while, I still had great fun with Lichdom: Battlemage. It's kind of a hit-or-miss game, though; get it when it goes on sale if it tempts you. If you like it, you'll think you got a bargain.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sientir/recommended/261760/","Sientir","Sientir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sientir/","466 products in account","As is indicated, I liked this game overall. I played it on one of the lower difficulty settings so that my health refilled itself more thoroughly. I still died several times, but the game handles death well.\n\nAnyway, for more of a review bit:\n\nThings I disliked:\n- Inventory Management. This game has a ton of it, primarily due to the way synthesis works. Synthesis is the term they apply to upgrading spell components, which come in two varieties: Shape and Augment. I won't get into full detail of all you need to worry about with these here, but suffice it to say that there is way too much complexity with this upgrade system, which requires a ton of planning in order to use well. I don't think the game is well served by this, but I can see how it would be hard to simplify as the developers of the game, so I have sympathy for why they didn't. They did add a "Smart Inventory" system that automatically upgrades stuff for you, though you lose all control in the process.\n- The limited variety in debuffs that enemies could apply to the player. There were basically two of them: two different temporary complete incapacitations and a time slow/snare effect. For the incapacitations, there was a freeze condition and a knockdown effect, both of which lasted for a short period of time and both of which could be extremely annoying when spammed. The time slow/snare effect was far more interesting, as it slows the player down and prevents dodging (but not shielding). As I said, all of these effects get overused primarily because they are the only effects the developers have to lean on aside from damage. I think the game would have been well served with a few more interesting debuffs for enemies to inflict on the player.\n- Lack of variety in ranged enemy attack patterns. Ranged enemies typically either fire one projectile at a time or do a burst of four projectiles, and it is very easy to tell which enemy is going to do which. This makes enemies extremely predictable. I would have liked to have seen a bit more variety in this.\n- Certain mechanics force specific styles of play. While there are a lot of different types of spells you can make, various mechanics in the game really emphasize playing a certain way over others. In general, damage over time effects are bad later in the game because of the functionality of synergies, which I'll touch on in just a moment. Also notable is that the lightning sigil (name for elements, basically) has a cool special mechanic that really wants you to not use a ray.\n- Synergies, while awesome, appear very late in the game and force a specific playstyle. I like synergies. A lot. I'll get into why more in the "things I liked" section below. However, there were several things I disliked about synergies. Probably the thing I had the biggest issue with was the charging method. To explain: To use a synergy, you must overkill enemies; damage beyond the enemy's health pool goes into the synergy meter. When charged, you can then use the Synergy move, which is a powerful, unique spell. In order to get huge amounts of overkill damage--and thus charge up the synergy--you need to build up mastery (a sort of damage multiplier effect), then hit the enemy with a charged destruction (raw damage) spell. Doing this well will result in huge amounts of damage. The result: Damage over time effects are very bad at building up synergy moves because they tend to deal very little extra damage. That makes damage over time effects bad. I also would have liked to have seen the synergies designed such that, for any three equipped sigils, you could have three synergies. This is generally not the case. It isn't a huge deal, but it would have been nice.\n\nThings I liked:\n- The variety of spell types. There are a lot of different ways to play, and combining different sigils and how you set them up leads to a lot of variety. It is fun to see how to match different sigils and spell types together to create different playstyles.\n- A decent variety of enemies, especially as the game progresses. There are some neat designs among some of the later enemies as well. Additionally there is a skill in learning which enemies to prioritize, how to react to certain enemy behaviors, and what to focus on.\n- There is a lot of room to develop skill in the game. Between learning spell functionality, and how to combine effects, as well as how to handle different situations, there is a ton of room for skill and mastery of systems. Understanding how things combine together, and what effects they have, is a key part of doing well at the game, and a lot of fun to learn when those "aha!" moments happen.\n- Synergies are awesome. I love having powerful, unique spells to unleash. I also like the consideration that goes into when to unleash them. There is also a pretty reasonable amount of variety in what you can do with them.\n- A lot of different sigil effects. I really appreciated how many different types of elements there were in the game. It gives the player a chance to find combinations that they really enjoy, and I appreciate the work that the developers put into the game to make the sigils feel distinct from each other, each with their own sets of strengths and weaknesses.\n- A variety of environments. The areas in the game have their own looks and feels, and I think these were done pretty well. While overall fairly standard (swamp, snowy mountain, and desert, to name a few), they were overall visually distinct from each other and had a good feel.\n- Challenge arenas for more loot. I liked these, as they provided, well a challenge in how to handle waves of strong(er) enemies.\n- I really like the base idea of a Mage-based FPS game.\n- They do a good job of implementing an ammo-less FPS game.\n- They have skillful defensive mechanics, which is something I really appreciate.\n- They handle player failure (death) well, making it part of the game. This is something I really like, and I want to call it out here. I dislike games that rely on quicksave systems and the like; a system like that would be extra brutal in a game like this that has such a huge emphasis on both loot and inventory management. Instead, they have a simple checkpoint/respawn system, and punish death with minor amounts of backtracking, refighting a few battles (which does provide more chances for loot), and a reduced loot quality drop rate (which increases whenever you reach a check point).\n\nThe TL;DR is: A solid magic-based FPS game that makes you feel like a powerful mage in a good way--by learning how to use your magic well and how to coordinate your spells. Unfortunately, a complicated spellcrafting system can lead to serious problems with inventory management for those that want more control than the smart inventory system provides.\n\nAs a note to all first person games: If you implement camera-bob, please make an option somewhere to turn it off. My stomach thanks you.\n\nFinally, I'd love to see a sequel with a simplified spell crafting system (I like the essence, but there is too much to track, ESPECIALLY with limited upgrades per item) and more synergies.","November 13, 2015","true","25.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

First off, I'd classify it more as an FPS than an RPG; it's more crysis than DA:O.  Secondly, the claim that there are millions of spells is a bit misleading.  Really there are 3 spell varants: Targetted (ones you shoot), AOE (ones that affect an area), and Nova (ones that go off on your locatoin if you parry block or charged blink in) that you mix with 3 types of augments that will either 1) make the spell do damage 2) make the spell control (like freezing them in place) or 3) mark enemies to multiply damage taken.  There are no mana bars so you can cast spells in any way you see fit, though they take time to cast and charge up (though crafting mods can change the times as well).\n\nOn the good side, there are some really original ideas here, and the campaign is not skimpy in the least -- it took me about 30 hours being thourough and doing all of the side challenges.  There is some really beautiful enviroment art, with a few standout set pieces that are top notch.  The story is fairly straightforward but works.  The crafting and loot finding can be fun with some issues.  But mostly I liked how they made some great decisions to really let you go wild.  Want to blink around without cooldowns or counters?  With one of the shield types you can!   Want to maximize a spell to just crit like a mofo -- you can!  The combat is fluid and fast paced and exciting by and large.\n\nThe crafting system is neat and I had fun crafting spells along the way, but it does become clunky and hard to navigate so it is a mixed bag.  It is hard to compare spells you may want to build with spells you are using because of some bad design (like you have to unequip spells in order to look at their parts).  Also, the upgrade system requires you to keep upgrading the low rarity spells into higher ones so your higher ones that you might care about have food to upgrade on - this becomes a chore that takes too much time.  All this can be interesting to some, but could have been much more streamlined.\n\nMy main complaint is that the enemies always spawn in at intervals.  This to me completely takes you out of feeling like these beautiful, lush environments (very pretty Cryengine3) are really a place that is lived in or has purpose.  Instead it makes it feel like wallpaper that you run though, fight, move forward, fight etc.  Another issue is that I feel like the inclusion of "Mastery" spell type (that marks enemies to take multiplier damage) was original, but ultimately a poor design choice.  There seemed to be a best solution that I came upon early:  control enemy, add mastery, then hit with crit or super crit damage.  Once I had a few spells with high Crit chance or Apocolyptical chance (when a crit crits), this by far was the best combat tactic that rendered most of the other sigil powers useless in comparison.

Not "Cthulu" and "We're-going-to-show-graphic-depictions-in-slow-motion-close-ups-of-people-getting-dismembered-limb-by-limb-and-then-eviscerated" graphic and disturbing, but very disturbing all the same. The content alone should earn this game an M-rating, and I don't say that out of personal offense. I enjoy the game, but you HAVE been warned.\nThe language in this game, while not constantly M-rated, is definitely deserving of an M-rating, simply because of how often the characters swear. It's completely understandable, given their circumstances, and realistic to be sure, but it's not kid-friendly language, so don't get it for your pre-teen thinking they won't hear a few new words and look them up. Because they will.\nSeriously, anyone who considers this game: it's more disturbing than the original Prototype. (Not nearly as much visceral gore though.)\n*END OF CONTENT DISCLAIMER*\n\nAlso, I use terms from the game, instead of trying to describe them as something else. Watch a Youtube video of it, and you'll understand why.\n\nStill reading?\nExcellent. Let's get to the good stuff.\n\nOkay, first off, it lives up to the premise of 'throw out the stereotype of the squishy magic user'.\nYou're pi$$ed-off, you're powerful, and you wreak havoc. Almost constantly. (Hey, even the hero needs a few minutes to catch his breath, right?)\n\nAdditionally, the variety of spells available to be created is truly enormous; the game lives up to its big promise here.\nI've only managed to craft a handful of Uniques so far, and they're the endgame content.\n\nABOUT SYNERGIES:\nNot all Uniques you can craft will have a Synergy, and not all Synergies will be usable***, even if you have the right sigils.\nBe aware, it's also possible you might craft a Unique and get a Synergy, only to have it not be for a Sigil you've been leveling - which, from what I've been able to discern, really sucks.*****\n\n***Continued in the 'MINOR CONS' section below.\n*****Continued in the 'MAJOR CONS' section below.\n\nNow I'll break it down into distinct pros and cons (of what I've encountered so far - I'm still playing through).\n\nPROS:\nThe game surprised me with how long each section is - pleasantly so. If you like this style of game, then it's worth it, considering the amount of content.\nThe tutorial system included in the game was well-written, and well-explained.\nFor the true explorer-types, there are little hidden areas that can only be found with a careful eye and a bit of experimentation, and they're pretty rewarding finds, so keep your eyes open.\nOld spells can be recycled, in a way, though the amount of each spell which can be recycled lessens as the game progresses.\nThere is a fully-functioning, lore-based save system, and while you lose environmental progress, YOUR progress remains.\nThe villains in this game? Oh, you have no idea. They are evil. As in 'If they were fighting Hitler, you'd be rooting for Hitler*' evil. I'm not kidding. Extremely good job on making us hate the villains.\n*(I didn't say ally with Hitler. You'd just beat him after the even worse guys are dead.)\n\nCONS:\nMAJOR CONS:\n*****\nI don't know if it's possible to re-level a Sigil you stopped leveling. The game informs you "this sigil will lose all leveling progess if it loses focus", and it does lose the progress - possibly permanently: it isn't clear if it's possible to re-earn the previous points/bonuses.\nAT FIRST GLANCE, ALTHOUGH THIS IS WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE CASE, I AM NOT CERTAIN IF I AM CORRECT. If it is impossible to regain lost Sigil levels and upgrades (instead of forcing you to re-earn them), that's a very poor mechanic.\nIf ANYONE is able to verify whether or not this is true, please, let me know - I'd rather have an accurate review, especially as this is a major part of the game. (Also, I really hope it isn't true!)\n\nMINOR CONS:\n***\nWhile it is possible to have up to 9 Unique spells equipped, you can only have a maximum of (I surmise) 3 Synergies ACTIVE at any one time (one for each spell bank). (Meaning that, when you trigger a Synergy from the equipped Spell Bank, THAT Synergy is the one that is used.)\nThis is based on my character having two Synergy-Spells equipped on the same Spell Bank (Kinesis, in this case), and being able to use only 1 at a time, despite having both of the other required elements in other Spell Banks (Fire and Lightning).\nThere is no way to cancel a Synergy that you're charging/have fully charged, without actually using it. You will start to hate muscle-memory when you forget this.\nSome of the more difficult battles (boss battles) can be VERY challenging if you don't have the right sigil combination, and/or you can't figure out what makes the boss 'tick', because NOTHING is explained in those battles; you need to play it by ear, and you need good reflexes.\nThere is no 'try before you buy' (so to speak) selection process for sigils; you don't even get a description of the spells for each sigil until you've already selected it. (You do, however, get a brief overview of each sigil when at the reliquary).\n\nVERY MINOR CONS\nYou can't sprint when you're charging a spell (although you can Blink) - any spell. This can get annoying, but I will concede that if they removed that limiter, the game would become significantly less challenging in certain parts.\nPRO/CON (personal choice):\nSomewhat repetitive gameplay, so don't expect to play through it all at once unless you REALLY like this style of play. (And have a LOT of free time on your hands - though I admit that I'm playing this like I play Skyrim: leave NOTHING unexplored.)\nThe entirety of the game is in 1st-person view. I personally prefer that, but I know some people who HATE 1st-person.\nThere is no save-scumming, at least so far as I've been able to tell.\n*FAIR WARNING*\nTHE ONLY WAY TO PAUSE ALL ACTION IS TO USE THE 'ESC' KEY. NOTHING ELSE WILL PAUSE. REMEMBER THIS WHILE CRAFTING.\n\nAnd the only gameplay tip I'll give:\nALWAYS observe the habits of enemies. You can play to the enemies' weaknesses if you know them well enough.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\nAll-in-all, the game seems to be a cross of twich-based, high-adrenaline spellfests, and tense hyper-alertness in atmospherically-fitting environments. Or moments of revulsion at the actions of the villains. STAY AWARE of your surroundings, and how best to use them to your advantage. Have fun!\n\n\n\n\n|===Aspect===||===Rating===|Gameplay8/10Environment8.5/10 (so far)Visuals8.5/10Atmosphere11/10Combat7.5/10Voice-Acting9.5/10Mechanics6.5-8.5/10*Story/Concept9.5/10Characters9.5/10Uniqueness10/10|===========||===========|==COMBINED=====RATING===|==88.5-90.5==||====100====|\n*Mechanics -- if the Sigils can't be re-leveled, then 6.5.

The controls and simple and intuitive and pretty quickly I was teleporting in and out of close range mixing it up with long range AOE attacks, well timed blocks that reflect whatever the current element you're weilding back on your attackers and the blink nova attack attached to your teleport. Like a lot of action oriented games I can see the game maybe becoming a little repetitive but since this is early access I have high hopes htat the devs will mix up the combat more as the game progresses. Although early in my playthrough so I only have 2 elements so far the idea of swapping elements on the fly to mix up attacks and strategies is a fun one. The crafting system is also fun as you try and discover the different ways the sigils combine to boost everything about your spells from the pure damage, to damage over time status effects and even the speed of the casting or charging of the spell. The story is interesting so far and hasn't detracted from the game at all like so many games have done in the past. All in all a good start and I wish the devs luck with the rest of the games creation. It is good to see another Early Access game that is working and fun to play. Get the fun down first and you can refine the experience as you go.\n\nI definitely reccomend this game to anyone who likes to be a badass magic user but is tired of the whole "glass cannon" trope that means you can't take many hits before going down. In Lichdom you can take a few hits, nuke the landscape in revenge all while blinking around the battlefield owning face.\n\nKeep up the good work guys.","May 21, 2014","true","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Here's the thing, Lichdom is a VERY graphically intense game, not for low range sytsems, and even some mid range systems. I have it on my laptop, which is an HP envy with an intel i-7 quad core processor at 3 ghz, nvidia geforce 740 2gb card, and 8 gb of ram, i get unplayable framerates on the lowest settings. It could just be my system, but i am able to run other games at the highest settings, such as starcraft 2, Dota 2, skyrim, etc. The concept of this game is freaking fun as crap, a mage with NO cooldowns, resources, or anything but raw power for that matter. The loot exceeds that of other games such as borderlands and destiny (i played the alpha on ps4 :P).

The update yesterday for example had ~ 4 GiB of material, so rest assured that the team is working hard to deliver a pristine experience. It plays very well already, there are not many nasty bugs, and this game does exactly what the guy in the video says it would. It makes you into a mage badass.\n\nWith the latest update they added a bit of an introduction into the game as well as a tutorial, and what previously was solely combat focused is now getting molded into an RPG. I'm quite impressed with the game so far, I wouldn't suspect it's not even in the alpha stage.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say that it's the only or the first game that unshackles the mage, it's definitely one that decided to take a unique approach to it.\n\nIn any case, it's an Early Access game, and if you feel you want to get a sneek peak into the game as it develops, or if you want to support the vision of the game, I would most certainly recommend it.

The one thing to beware of if you are interested in purchasing this before it is complete is that while the core gameplay mechanics are there, they do not scale evenly along with the levels.  This leads to encountering points where all you can do to progress is grind, die and acquire as much loot as you can to power up your spells to make it to the next checkpoint.\n\nThe system for leveling up spells scales according to loot gained from different tiers.  This unfortunately means that you can never reach a point where you are overpowered because the AI at the farthest point will come at you in force and use coordinated strategies that work best when using more than one element.  Since each element has a unique combination of buffs, damage and timers, no single element will work well against a coordinated balanced team [of AIs].  All in all it challenges me to go through regions with a conservative play-style or die in two hits.\n\n-@ The Development Team-\nWhile I do appreciate the work that has gone into the level design and the high resolution assets present throughout the first two levels,  there is little stress put on why you are encountering said finely crafted assets.  Considering the amount of time spent grinding in one given area, the visually pleasing environment offsets the boredom that grows after fighting through a section half a dozen times.  If the developers would incorporate a map or a ruined map to show what was at your location that might well add the necessary significance to the setting and encourage players to explore some side passages and pay more attention to the models.  Varying how loot containers look might also encourage players to take a closer look at the world and not aim for just the mobs or glowing glyph in front of them.  If the user experience is derived from how long you can kite mobs or how much effort is put into grinding and subsequently building spells, the end result seems too shallow for a game with so much potential.\n\nI have enjoyed the pre-alpha version and in consideration of the work put into building the current version (2014.04.08.47440) I give it 8/10.\n\nPS: In future versions, utilizing non-combatant npcs (seemingly random flocks of birds) as triggers/signals for [initially] neutral enemies would add some nice diversity to opponents.\n","April 24, 2014","true","21.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It promises to be a game where you play a "badass mage" with a customizable magic system and lots of different spells of different elements, but it fails in its execution. The spell system is simply 4 base spells where you get to choose the "Element" (Particle Color) of it and some minor stat variability between things you get from monsters that serve as customization to your spells. At the end you have 8 elements just like each other ( Except the color) and 24 spells that do the following: Damage, Increase Damage, Stun(increases damage too), the only exception is Necromancy wich allows you to summon undead from enemy bodies, but they screwed up in necromancy too. You don't know wich kind of undead you have following you, you have to run up to the summon you want before it disappears to make it follow you, undead you retain appear when they feel like doing so, so sometimes you have to get so hits just so they wake up. Besides the magic issues there's also the big turn off of this game: Repetitive Gameplay. Combats are all the same, same monsters, same mechanics, predictable actions and bosses are either too hard and take you down on 1 skill or too tanky and take an eternity to kill.\nTldr: Great Concept, Poor Execution. The game does not reach for what it promised: Repetitive gameplay, Repetitive magic system and the story is not that great too.\n","December 11, 2014","false","6.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Somehow I thought this was going to feel like playing Skyrim with god-mode on but it's actually quite hard in the beginning.

With that amount of money, better get Oblivion with the mage tower DLC and/or plug any magic mod.","September 7, 2014","false","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Hard to learn and hard to master, but you will feel godlike once you do. IF you do.\n- Despite your great power the game still feels challenging. Mistakes often lead to death and respawning at the last checkpoint (Dark Souls style) – you can't save/load at will.\n- Crafting proper spells is only a half of success – you have to learn to use them in an action-packed environment. You have to dodge and block enemy attacks.\n\nLet me elaborate some more about the magic system, which is the main selling point of this game, and yet it puts some people off. You'll see a lot of reviews / forum posts saying "All schools of magic feel the same", "All you do is spam your fireball and backpedal till things die", "You only have a choice of 3 spells", "You have to kite the first boss for 15 minutes", etc.\n\nI hate to sound arrogant, but all those people are wrong. You can use devastating spell combinations, freeze your enemies, teleport them around or dominate their minds, summon black holes and elementals, raise armies of undead, even slow time for everyone but yourself, matrix style (and watch your frozen enemies shatter into a fine red mist, in slow motion). You can kill the first boss in under 30 seconds if you combine Control, Mastery and Destruction spells (and build them properly). Oh, and have I mentioned summoning swarms of deadly insects?\n\nAll the "mindless fireball spam" posts were written by people who didn't try to explore the magic system. Problem is, the game explains how to combine reagents into spells, but it doesn't tell you WHAT to craft and how to use it to best effect. In order to understand this game, you have to read page-long tooltips. (A lot of people just mindlessly combine reagents and see what happens - I assure you, this is not a viable strategy.) Maybe you'll even have to read a guide on the forums. (Although I believe it's not neccessary - just reading the tooltips and trying to strategize was enough for me.)\n\nSo if you like to explore complex game mechanics, think and strategize - you'll probably like this game. If you just want to have some mindless fun with magic, if reading long spell descriptions sounds boring - this is probably not the game for you.\n\nAlso, if you uninstalled Dark Souls after playing for 2 hours, this might not be the game for you – the difficulty is on par with Dark Souls until you master your spellcraft - after that it's still challenging but no longer brutal.\n\nUltimately, this game is all about blowing things up and feeling powerful. You just have to do your homework – your power will be even more sweet because you've earned it.","August 30, 2014","true","109.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Enemy AI is terrible.. every unit in the game just runs straight at u not trying to dodge or hide or anything, just autolocks and sprints at u.\n\n2. would be 100% better if the game was randomly generated. Seeing areas for the first time is awesome. but then seeing the same exact enviroment never change is kinda lame.\n\n3. Bosses: regardless of what boss it just comes down to .. Shoot Shoot kite.. Shoot Shoot Kite. kinda upseting.\n\n4. Kinda same for enemies.. harder enemies that dont die in 2 hits is the same.. kite kite shoot type of thing.\n\nHowever VERY skilled players can play the game dramatically different. I have one setup which is ultra  aggressive based on the block mechanic where a perfect block negates all damage. Instead of kiting and shooting you sit in the face of the enemy the entire time. makes the game extremely more fun however is extremely difficult to pull off.","August 28, 2014","true","16.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My brother and my friend both told me to try it. i had some extra money so i had gotten it. then they made me play it as soon as i had it downloaded. the only reason i let them pressure me into getting it is because it runs on Cryengine 3. That engine is amazing and looks great. When i finally went to play it i was suprised at the fact that i was actually having fun with the game. i got to the first boss and MY GOD was it hard. like it honestly was't that hard but for a first boss it was a bit redicilous. after that i continued because i thought it was a pretty descent game. I then came to realize you have diffrent magic types that the game calls Sigils. you can switch between them in a fight and you can upgrade them. you collect upgrades for your sigis that allow you to add diffrent perks and advancements to your magic and sheild.\n\nOver all i would give this game a 8/10 it is a really fun game and it really doesn't quite fit in just one genre.","November 30, 2014","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The object of the game is portrayed as having limitless possibility in the spells you can create and use in an epic adventure, kind of similar in style to Skyrim.\n\nThis isn't the case at all. Really. The game's crafting system consists of 3 aspects, all of which are decently limited. The type of Sigil (Sigils are most like elements, like Ice or Fire or Necromancy), the type of spell (Beam, ray, ect.), and augmentations (bonus stats). This game is incredibly misleading in the whole 'limitless' aspect. In my time playing, most of the spells I've made pretty much seemed to do the same thing, if not slightly different. Throughout the game I really just didn't feel like I needed to use anything besides a fireball. The game really gave me no reason to use anything else, because all spells are crafted using the same basic typings and that greatly hinders the actual variability of the elements. And, even when the game did influence me to use other Sigils, it was in really bold, childish, and boring manners. Some enemies either had shields that blocked one instance of damage, forcing me to use a ray (And navigating the awful crafting menu to equip it. Mercy.), or an enemy might have been resistant to an element. Also, speaking on categories of enemies and the like, this game was very unclear about anything that was happening. Enemies give you no warning when they attack, big or small, which wouldn't be an issue if the game was intended to be that way. It just feels like big hulking monsters can walk up to my backside and slug me for half of my health without me even noticing. Overall the game was just a big disappointment. Don't pick it up.","December 24, 2014","false","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

First of all, I bought the game on sale (37 euros is a ridiculous price I must say for this game), I was attracted by two main things: (1) the game uses cryengine, which I appreciate a lot and was curious to see what other developers (besides crytek) could do with it (2) I could be a badass mage....which I never am in normal RPGs, throwing spells and see all the light effects on screen and so on.\n\nThe game revealed itself as some kind of unfinished business. I have no idea about what happened in early access so can't compare with what it was before. In any case, the game feels VERY unpolished in terms of narration, combat, management of inventory. It is very disorienting and spending most of the time trying to figure out what the 100.000 different spell combinations/upgrades (which in the end look all the same) doesn't really help the immersion in the game.\n\nAnd anyway, all technicalities aside, if a game doesn't make me want to progress further, then there is something wrong with it. Or maybe I had different expectations. Can't rate it because I did not finish it, but did not like what I saw.","February 24, 2015","false","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's about the only thing that made me play the game actualy.\n\nMaps are very big and usualy that should be a good thing. BUT!!!! Check point system is rather a pain. The distance between is long and you will have to walk all over if you die. (And kill people again... I'm all for it actualy, if it wasn't for a VERY MONOTONE fight / spell designs. Really, so much potential but they didn't add anything for real. Able to throw fireballs but can't interract with world objects as a badass mage should. -Let me correct it, you actualy DON'T INTERRACT WITH WORL OBJECTS AT ALL!- All you do charging your spells and shoot them at enemies. That's the ONLY THING you do in fight. One missile type magic and one AOE magic. Spell varriations change as ice / fire / lightning and blaa but the spell casting and effects are the same. Liked Necromancy though, making a horde of undead to fight your battles is the least tiring way to win.)\n\nI would recommend you to buy this game only if it's on a discount.

In D3 the chars can have a conversation without having to struggler over NOTHING. Or have to wonder over everything.\n\nMechanics:\nThe gameplay feels unintuitive and even slow. I have to hold the F key, only to activate something. Why not just hitting the key once and be done with it?\n\nMaybe I was expecting too much of a First Person Shooter that uses magic instead of guns? In this game aiming doesn’t mean much. There is not even a crosshair, and spells like the fire ball seek their target automatically. Well, different game then, OK.\n\nThough, the tactless tutorials left me to bother about how the mechanics even really function. In the beginning of the game it shows tutorial videos. And before I’m really done understanding what that was all about, they just disappeared again without asking for a click-to-continue. It’s tiresome to learn this game by watching the tutorial video and having to read the video’s text at the same time.\n\nOne longer text I couldn’t finish reading because I got distracted by its video. It closed and I learned nothing. Leaving me with the feeling that I skipped something important.\n\nYou think that was a bad first impression? Guess what? This game is tagged as indie, thing is though. As soon as you start this game, a bunch of CGI logo animations greed you, which you CAN’T skip. Lichdom: Battlemage could have been published by EA. Indie devs don’t make unskippable CGI logo animations at game start-up EVER!\n\nConclusion:\nI bought this on sale for 7 Euros. I guess I will be back later for some more, but for now I had enough of this first impression. I already don't like the mentality this game is presenting.\n\nI'm uncertain about the spell system. So I just leave this here. The 3 hours are only because of technical isssues and because of a second run with the "tutorial".","June 20, 2015","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have no idea about what happened in early access so can't compare with what it was before. In any case, the game feels VERY unpolished in terms of narration, combat, management of inventory. It is very disorienting and spending most of the time trying to figure out what the 100.000 different spell combinations/upgrades (which in the end look all the same) doesn't really help the immersion in the game.\n\nAnd anyway, all technicalities aside, if a game doesn't make me want to progress further, then there is something wrong with it.

Well, it did not have any voice-overs at the moment, no motivation to go forth. Just pure concept. WHen it got out, I did try it again. And I actually lie it. A bit off my style, since it's purely ased on magic and I am more of a slasher guy (like knifes more than guns in real life too), but... It feels pretty good. Reminds me of Hunted: Demon's Forge. And I liked that one. As as with Hunted I want to get deeper into the lore here. I want to know more about the characters. That is enough for me. At least at the moment.\nStill not sure about the crafting system. Yes, I can see that it may give some small beefits, but.. So far it feels a bit useless. More like a vanity customization. I mean like changing "forms" may give some tactical advantage at some points, but other than that, do not see much point in it. Maybe it will change a bit later in the game, though.\nGraphically it looks quite solid. Maybe not perfect (some animation on female Gryphon seemd a bit odd), but really solid. And yet it runs pretty smoothly. And even though it's mainly dungeons they do not seem to repeat each other (at least not so far).\nIn terms of audio it is good as well. I liked voice actors here. They ar eone of the reason I am reminded of Hunted: Demons Forge. It's similar to it: a bit of humor, a bit of an attitude from both characters, but yet some kind of understanding and acceptance of each other. Like there is a bond there already, that will only get stronger (don't think that in a romantic way, though, since will kill male Dragon's goal).\nI think I'll give it an 8.","August 30, 2014","true","4.6"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","0"

In addition, I can't say I have really played anything else exactly like it in the FPS genre. If I had to describe it, (which I will) it would be Bioshock, without weapons except for plasmids/vigors, and no manapool to exhaust. Your battle effectiveness is solely based on your skill and how powerful you make your "plasmids" along with how you modify and upgrade them. There is a hole realm of customization of spells and abilities that I seems to be pretty robust, though I have yet to actually grasp the crafting system for these spells and abilities yet.\n\nThere is still a roughness to this game. The gameplay itself is pretty solid, so this is probably why the developer decided to officially take it out of Beta. However, there are still parts, like player direction and a lack of proper explanation of skills, that seem to be lacking. In general it is mostly in presentation more than content where the roughness exists. It's not polished yet. So if you want a game to just be mindless on, your probably better off looking elsewhere, because you might actually have to... read stuff... i.e. the in game journal to understand things.\n\nThat being said, the story is interesting, and gameplay is challenging. I foresee a lot of enjoyment / rage  in the near future.  I am really looking forward to it.","August 31, 2014","true","4.4"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

So if you were expecting Morrowing or Skyrim, look elsewhere, although it has some RPG elements. The gameplay is innovative, with a crafting system that gives you some kind of progression. The game is hard, the minions actually can do a lot of damage in certain parts, and the bosses are tough (although I think they sometimes have way too much health, dragging out battles as opposed to making it hard). Also your spells are pretty amazing and flashy; certain spell combos will make special effects, so that is cool.\nThe game tries to make you feel ultra strong and such, and it really does. To balanced out your seemingly overpowered-ness, you are pitted against a lot of really strong enemies, notably demons in certain parts.\n\nNow for pro and con list:\n+Innovative crafting system, which is difficult to abuse to it's fullest, but is very rewarding once you do\n+ The spell effects have a lot of flashy effects, which combined with the destruction you are inflicting, gives a real sense of power.\n+ It is fairly difficult, but enjoyable. You can always tweak down the difficulty to make it easier to play if need be.\n-The game requires a fairly beefy computer, with some really high system requirements. As such you may have difficulty running the game without heavy tweaking to the graphics and resolution.\n- Some parts of the game are just agitating. Being frozen solid for 10 seconds is annoying.\n- Repetitive enemies, mostly just reskins of past enemies but beefier.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game, but only for a certain type of person. If you are the guy who always plays mage, or wants a difficult yet enjoyable game, this is a good choice.","November 6, 2014","true","26.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Wrong, all you get after casting whatever boring ball of something you have as a spell at them a few times is just a small explosion at the most.\n\nMaybe the game gets better later on, I read the forums and saw people talking about some amazing spells like storms and tornados and summoning a demon.

Each level more or less goes blast through tons of trash mobs and then fight boss battle. I went through the game with pretty much just one spell once i found what was most effective.\n- spells need re-balancing, little point in using anything else than max dps Single target missile attacks.\n- although alot of detail went into the environments they are just decoration and cannot be interacted with.\n\nAgain i think this game is worthwhile for mmorpg and/or Elder scrolls lovers but it is more or less a on trick pony shoot em up.","October 13, 2014","true","67.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Pros and cons below. Overall i recommened this game to anyone who enjoyed playing skyrim, dark souls or other similar types games.\n\nPros:\n- Cryengine 3 graphics are excellent.\n- Enjoyable game play with well designed levels.\n- Story is okay, immesive and logical.\n- a needed break from MMORPG and a nice upgrade from modded skyrim.\n\nCons:\n- The spell crafting system is way more cumbersome and confusing than it needs to be with an overwhelming number of statistics that in the end don't really ammount to anything significant.\n- Although there are thousands of spell combinations you don't end up using them because the gameplay is one dimensional. Each level more or less goes blast through tons of trash mobs and then fight boss battle. I went through the game with pretty much just one spell once i found what was most effective.\n- spells need re-balancing, little point in using anything else than max dps Single target missile attacks.\n- although alot of detail went into the environments they are just decoration and cannot be interacted with.\n\nAgain i think this game is worthwhile for mmorpg and/or Elder scrolls lovers but it is more or less a on trick pony shoot em up.","October 13, 2014","true","67.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I played through the tutorial, and some of the first level. I imagined it would be a fun game with a large variety of magical spells to mess around with. What I found out was that there are not that many spells. There is the one where you shoot the magic, the one where you block the magic, the one where you shoot the magic again but it comes from a different angle, and the one where you... oh wait there's no more. So, you are a mage, oh sorry a "dragon", who can only do three different attacks? I know you can do different elements, but why? Three spells. I guess it would be to hard to add in some actual VARIETY. Oh look, I shot a skeleton with magic. I shot another one with a different kind of magic that is not really different. Whoop-de-doo. And also the "hard" enemies are just unfair and hard to hit with the lag. The levels suck, also. I guess I can't really have an opinion on this because I played so little, but, throughout the first level, nothing really changed. Ruins that way, skeletons that way, and... walls. So for the combat system I would give it a 3/10. The scenery (beginning of game) I would give a 4/10. I didn't play long enough to get into the story of the game, so I will just give that bagel/10. The overall fun of the game is... 3/10 (it sucks).

The bosses all basically one shot you and their hit boxes are way too large which allow no way to escape the attack. The starting level seems really easy and everything is going smooth until the first boss which made me uninstall this peice of crap. Whoever was in charge of designing this boss needs to go stand in the middle of a highway and run away by a 18 wheels trailer.\n\nAvoid this game at all costs.

As I read other comments I do feel this game does need more spells and sigils as only eight for an only mage game is too low compared to skyrim which has like twenty. I also agree upon that it feels as though it is an arena and your fighting the same undead as you go from one room to the next but it also gets harder as you go on expecially the first boss which i feel is really hard to beat tried multiple times but had failed and even restarted to pick a new sigil to try. I feel that the first boss should weaken and my last concern is spellcrafting and sigil explanation which in all honestly is extremely confusing even with the help of tutorials im still confused on what is master, control, and aoe is so i try to stay away from spellcrafting even though its vital to stay strong. Other than that the game is extremely fun but it would be way more fun if it was open world where you can explore more place.","August 11, 2014","true","11.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Nothing really explains crafting as a whole, nor shows you how its done. So, even if you happen to have the right stuff to make a fantastic spell with a nice patern, you wouldnt know because this game is a piece of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBlink is practically gone. It USED to be good. It was infinite, like the rest of your powers and skills. Then, for some reason they decided to make this game complete crap by destroying the only real defense you have. ♥♥♥♥ attacks you from all angles, so shield is completely useless. You cant see when mobs are attacking you from behind or the side, and they spawn frequently so its not like you could see them comming anyway because they just APPEAR. Boss fights are annying, Demons and anything you once had protection from via skill and timing now become fustrating and pointlessly long, drawn out battles of you getting hit by homing wtf ever they shoot. Even if you see something a mile a way comming right at you you cant even dodge it because YOU ♥♥♥♥ING RAN OUT OF YOUR MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING INFINITE POWER OF BULL♥♥♥♥INGSHIT.\n\nYou are slow as ♥♥♥♥, even when running. And, also on a note, you run faster in the time you use up your blink and farther. 80% of your spells require you to charge or hold a button...and you become slower when you hold a button....you are a slow, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥ mage that takes ten minutes to kill a small group of mobs. Why is this "Battle Mage" so slow? You have no way to change your run speed....no buffs.....no magic that helps you teleport, and you cant jump because you are white.\n\nThe "Homming" skill misses constantly, and doent lock on to anything unless you fire directly at it. Sure your spells looke fine, but they arent effective at all when you look at other wizards in  just about every other game\n\nLets compare:\n\nD&D = Better mages & spells\nKingdom Of Amalur = Best damn battle mage ever\nCity of Heroes = Amazing Magic users way more fun and could even heal themselves and others.\nWoW = Mobile, fast, and WAY better mages\nSuper Mario = Way better fire mage and shape shifter\nHairy Potter Games = Way better combat mage\nWizardry 1 - 10 = Way better mages\nEye of the Beholder = Better mages\nMight and Magic 1 - 8 = Way better mages\nGauntlet (All of them) = Way better combat mages\n\nThe list is pretty much unending, to be honest. No game has slow, defensless, clumsy mages that cant even cast a small, basic, starting spell quickly. They simply wouldnt graduate. Lichdom failed in every aspect except visual. Even the sounds are like nails on a chalk board. Every time something dies its screams so loud it hurts your ears. If you fx the volume, you cant hear the spawns and get back attacked, and probably will miss dialogue as well that would be useful.\n\nThe game also puts "One way" paths where you fall down a tiny ledge and cant go back.....right next to a MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING TELEPORTER. Seriously...what the hell is the point of putting one way paths if you can teleport wherever you want with a teleporter?\n\nFor real this gmae just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off when I got to the "Oasis" area. Every group was an annoying fight of shot and run behind a rock. Everything had knock down, freeze, slow and ranged that didnt miss. Each fight took time and patience...but I was loosing my patience when it every god damn time I needed another blink, it wouldnt let me have it because it was recharging. And, of course, you run so slowly that it was pointless to bother fleeing to pick off one at a time. Then the boss battle was what made me quit playing. I just realized I wasnt enjoying the game mechanics enough to want to get a bigger head ache.\n\n"Lichdom sets a New Gold Standard" in being the slowest, most random, gear dependant mage possible...\n\nBuy it only if you like pretty colors. The "Tactical" combat gets very old VERY fast. You have to use one spell, then another spell, and in the time it takes to use those two spells, you could have easily just spamed a simple destruction spell withthe same result. Both take endless amounts of time, btw. I think I mentioned you being very SLOW in this game. Casting is NO acception.\n\nBeauty is all this game has going for it. While I hope other companies progresstake to the grphical advancement of the UT engine in its current form, I really hope they make action games what they used to be....action.","July 8, 2014","false","23.0"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delfofthebla/recommended/261760/","Delfofthebla","Delfofthebla","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delfofthebla/","206 products in account","==\nDISCLAIMER: I played during Early Access up until about a week before "full release". I have not tried it since it has fully released. If I do I will likely update my review based on how much has changed (if anything).\n===\n\nI will say this, the game isn't that bad, but it isn't all that good either. I want to recommend it, because I respect what the developers were trying to achieve, but unfortunately, I just don't feel like they did a good job.\n\n\nThe trailer and description for the game seems to be about driving home the idea that you are a "powerful mage".\n\n\nYou aren't.\n\n\nThe game follows a very linear, very uninteresting path across several levels. The graphics are decent, but the scenery is meh and the storyline is sub-par at best. I did not feel attached to the characters nor the world. Certain spell effects look pretty cool, but most aren't anything special. Really the only thing the game has to offer is the idea of "being a powerful mage". However, the game just doesn't do a good job of delivering that message.\n\nLichdom is a game of RNG, Grinding, and Crafting. You start with a couple of basic spells and basically just run in a straight line firing spells off at the same monsters over and over and over. Occasionally, these orb things pop out and fly into you. These are crafting components used to create more powerful spells. The only real thing to do in this game is keep walking down that straight path and hope you get some cool drops. Then you spend 20 minutes trying to craft a better version of a spell you're already using and repeat the process. It's kind of enjoyable at first, but gets really boring really fast.\n\n\nPROS:\n1) Spell crafting is kind of fun.\n2) Certain spell concepts are interesting and fun to use.\n3) It's a first person RPG game, which enjoyable for me, but is somewhat rare for the genre.\n4) I like the graphic style.\n5) I kinda like the voice actors and the dynamic they tried to create between the character and their "partner". I also like that that role switches based on whether you choose male or female. It's kinda neat.\n\nCONS:\n1) Not enough enemy variations.\n2) Uninteresting level design.\n3) Uninteresting story.\n4) A lot of spells are useless or unviable.\n5) Very RNG based. A good drop can destroy the balance of your character, and a lack of any good drops makes you feel worthless and weak.\n6) The design of the spell types really limits the game\nLichdom has 3 types of spells.\n* AOE\n* Shield\n* Targetted\n\nYou can only ever perform one "action" at once. That means you can't charge up an AoE spell while having some sort of shield spell be active. You're either charging an AoE, firing off a targetted spell, or triggering a shield spell.\n\nWhat's worse, is that AoE abilities take like 6 years to charge up, and hardly ever do enough damage to even be considered. The Shield abilities are only triggered if you block the exact moment an enemy hits you, which is hard to judge and is inconsistent with the animations of enemy attacks. That leaves targetted abilities, the only type of skill you will actually ever use in this game. And wuddya know! A lot of those spells have AoE's!\n\nI found that when playing this game, it was so much better to just craft some pseudo Targetted spell that had an AoE component to it, or just focus on a high damaging single target ability. I basically ignored the other two types in all of my playthroughs. This really makes the crafting system of the game feel uninteresting. 2 thirds of the possible drops you can achieve you basically just throw in the trash because you don't need them. It's far too viable to make a character that has one or two powerful targetted abilities that can clear whole groups of monsters at once. It just makes the game feel that much more dull, and it makes getting those kinds of crafting drops unenjoyable.\n\n6) "No Spell Cooldowns or mana costs"\nThe developers seem to have thought that this was something that made mages feel less powerful. They couldn't have been more wrong. By removing cooldowns and mana costs, you're basically telling the players "Hey, find a spell that works the best and use that and only that.\n\nMana costs and cooldowns allow game designers to make players feel like they are casting something big, something powerful. By taking that away, that sense of power completely dissapears. I don't feel like a powerful mage by throwing 3000 ice balls at the same 5 zombies. I just feel like a derp.\n\nNot to mention, cooldowns are an excellent tool that force players to mix and match special combos and strategies that they either wouldn't have thought of, or just wouldn't have bothered with if not for the existence of a cooldown. Sure, I COULD freeze a giant group of enemies and then flame nuke them for a one shot kill, but if I have a different skill that can two shot everything, why wouldn't I just use that twice?\n\nThat's just one example but there are a lot of situations where certain combos are just not worth it. You could call it a balance issue but I dunno, the whole system just feels boring and wrong. Cooldowns should be a part of this game, and they're not.\n\n\n\n===\n\nSo yea, I can't recommend this game. I definitely had some fun with it, and there ARE enjoyable aspects, but I am left with more dissapointment than anything. It's possible the developers can improve on some of these things over time, but we haven't been given any indication that they plan to do so, so I'm not holding out for that.","August 31, 2014","false","20.9"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

This game is totally not worth $20, I would say $5 is a fair price. Now, the combat in this game is as good as it looks, very fun combat. My huge problem with this game is that there is absolutely no story whatsoever. You spawn in a random cave and just follow a path. I have no idea what my goal is or why I am in this cave, there is nothing to explain it, not even a little diolauge from the character saying, "How did I get here?" or something along those lines. I have met another character, but there is no voice, just subtitles, not even a lip movement.This bothers me more than it should. I know it is just the alpha, but you think they would have some voice actors.  This game is very repetitive. A game should not be repetitive, but this game is far worse, so far I have only seen 4 enemies with exception to bosses. Most of the enemies are totally OP! You have like 3 health bars, or shields as they call it, and once you lose them, your dead. There are ranged crossbow guys they take out one health bar in one shot. Once they do, you're basically screwed, because they do not regenerate, you have to find a glowing orb which is more uncommon than it should be. They also mentioned crafting spells, which I thought was a brilliant idea. I wouldn't call it crafting though, more so altering spells. For a game where only magic can be used, you think there would be more than fire and ice. When you "craft" spells, all you can do is change how much damage your fireballs do, or reduce the charge time for your ice shots. Now you may be thinking, "Quit hating, it's just the Alpha!" and I understand that, but just about every element would need to be changed in order to make this an adiquite game. Please do not buy this yet, wait at least until beta to see if it improves, but this game is not worth the $20 I spent. Overall, it is not yet a sound game and needs many improvements, but it is not the worst game I have ever played.","April 21, 2014","false","4.0"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","13","30","0","1"

It's good but it's not $40.00 good.\n\nI will give this game a good rating for it's difficulty and graphics. Especially the visuals. They spent a good amount of time making the scenery look awesome and it really does.\n\nOn the the cons... While the game sounds cool, the premis of being an all powerful battlemage the game diddn't give me that feeling.\n\nThe spells are cool and you can esentially non stop cast but the spells you can use during each encounter are limited to three elements and only a few attack spells per. You have to stop and change you're slots and when you do you lose the level progress. I was hoping for a complete toolbelt of spells. I'm the kind of guy that likes keybinding too so it would've been cool to be able to sue some of that.\n\nFIghts are redundant.

Did you play Skyrim? If yes then I will tell you the spellcasting system is similar to the one spell in one hand, one in another. Though Skyrims spell system is not anywhere as indepth as Lichdom I will say Skyrim is still better because even though the spell system is limited the gameplay doesn't feel so redudtant and linear.\n\nI will reccomend it but just barely.

At some parts, it's simply awkward and the array of spells is limited at this point.\n\nHowever, for an early access game, it's extremely impressive. The concept of putting focus on a magic playstyle is great, and even with so little spells, the destructive power of the spells and the combinations you can achieve with them is awesome. With Cry Engine, the game looks great and the spells, fire spells in particular, yield very visually stunning special effects. I'm interested in how the developer portrays the world surrounding a true battlemage, and I can't wait to see more.\n\nTo put it simply, I'm highly intrigued by this game and I highly recommend it.","April 1, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/prinfection/recommended/261760/","prinfection","Forecast Octopus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/prinfection/","509 products in account","While the production values are pretty top notch, this game has very mediocre levels, handling, and mechanics.\n\nMovement is functional, but clunky.  Evasive dash mechanic is very clunky and is limited in some facets in a way that makes it difficult to understand the limits.  Further, you can very easily dash into pits and not even know that it happened.  While battlefield management is a valid game design element, without being able to jump holes in the floor are not far off from megaman spikes.\n\nThe spell system, the core and meat of what this game offers to someone looking for a wizarding game suffers a lot from trying to be a loot treadmill.  While the idea of being able to craft your own spells out of components is initially very interesting, the actual variety of spells is extremely limited.  You will get tons of components to craft spells that barely differ from one to the next, and you will have piles of these things that will initially overwhelm and then immediately underwhelm.\n\nCombat itself is stilted by the spell system as either constantly switch between elements to take advantage of control spells, that manipulate enemy function and almost all additionally "store damage" that is released by damage spells.\n\nThis would be a cool mechanic if it weren't for that this does very little to add to the game and ultimately just leads to either A) a lot of constantly switching back and forth between two weapons, creating micromanagement that doesn't add to the fun because it is somewhat required or B) Set up a single element to have control as one component and damage as the other.\n\nWhat further complicates this is that the critical damage system (which, awesomely, allows for double crits), demands that you charge your spells to do guarantee critical damage if you want to actually make use of your efforts.  The starter fireball spell does ~80 damage out the gate, crit ~190, and if you crit into a charged pool effect with control, over 600 and doens't require reapplications.\n\nThis example may sound cool, but that's not an example, that's basically the beginning and end, not doing it this way will feel like your spells are just very colorful cotton balls a lot of the time, or you'll be constantly reapplying control effects for bonus damage, or ignoring them all together just to avoid having to micromanage the issue.  You may say "well, that doesn't sound so bad, really, it's not that much extra work", except that if you don't specifically craft a spell for increased control duration, the duration will wear off almost immediately upon casting your spell, assuming you have no delay between the effect being applied and the following damage spell.  Otherwise, the effect can easily wear off before it applies.\n\nThis rapidly leads to a game feel where instead of having individual powerful and fun spells that you have to juggle spell components in the middle of battle to generate basic effects.  That would be great if it was like Magicka where you're wielding elements and then unleashing them, but all that "spell crafting" is done in menus and then just functions as small modifiers on how the weapon functions.\n\nWhich, again, wouldn't be bad, if the crafting wasn't 90% just stacking bonuses instead of having different spell effects.\n\n\n======== Further Play Review ========\n\nThe game never changes.  You get new elemental sigils, and more and more things to craft, and the enemy variety alters slightly, but this is, otherwise, a completely linear cooridoor shooter that fails to reward you and will punish you without explaining to you what you've done.\n\nAvoid this game unless it's at a deep discount and you otherwise don't believe me.","December 10, 2014","false","4.3"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I sort of like the game, some aspects of it atleast, but there's just something off about the gameplay. It felt like that in beta and the final game is pretty much the same. Even though I am getting some enjoyment out of the game I don't think I'll recommend it to anyone. The game didn't turn out quite the way I hoped... it just feels oddly sluggish and not like the explosion of badassness it was supposed to be. It's like a cumbersome, unwieldy version of Painkiller; not as fast and not as much fun... sadly. If only the gameplay matched the graphics. Unfortunately the nice visuals are on top of some fairly lacklustre and badly paced gameplay.\n\nEdit: After toying around with settings I conclude that the game performs abysmally on NVIDIA hardware (GTX 670 (OC)) [i7-4770K, 16 GB RAM]. Lichdom also has the worst vsync implementation ever... anything even slightly below 60 fps is dropped to a stuttering 30 fps. Not a good combination when the game basically runs like a chained snail in a pit of salt.","August 26, 2014","false","34.9"," 19 of 48 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","19","48","0","0"

The graphic are pretty good, if somber, with a good amount of details. They would have been a lot more enjoyable however with more interaction. The starting level, in a town, showed the color in that, plenty of places to sneak in... with absolutely no easters eggs of any kind.\n\nThere are a fair amount of enemies in successive arena. The instant rebirth, with a decent penalty, isn't bad per see... but it is awful when the enemies are always exactly the same, in the same place. The game would have been better off with procedures-generated levels, at least for the enemies.\n\n\nThe greatest failure of the game however, is the gameplay and control. Lichdom uses a setting more adapted to console, and perhaps gamepad, than computers with keyboards. It show terribly in combat, making using defence, combo, charged nova, and dancing around enemies a gigantic CHORE rather than a fun tactical challenge.\n\nIt increase a degree with the 3 sigils limits, in each three cases with one targeted spell, one aoe, and one defense sigil... that you have to swap between color during combat to use as combos.\nA freer configuration allowing to set up multiple style of casting with different colors might have taken longer to configure, but would have been a LOT more fun... correct that, it would HAVE been fun, rather than a boring sitting session once you realize how limited the system is.\n\nThe synthesis and equipment moments generally kill all remaining interest. It's extremely random since its update, never tell you what you're going to get, force you to swap between journal and menu, taking far too many seconds each time, to make good setups...\nAgument for instance, for some reason, show the special modifiers bonus when you create a spell... but not the amount destruction/control/mastery associated with them, forcing you to check or make half-♥♥♥♥♥ comparaison with the show stats.\n\nIt get worse when you see how the synthesis menu work, given that every item is put through a single list where it can take a minute, or entire minutes, plural, after enough enemy kills.\n\nThis was especially disappointing after coming from Transistor, which had a great deal many combos and tactics to assemble.\n\nBaring a large-scale overhaul of the Lichdom: Battlemage, I would recommend to avoid this game.

Maybe it will pick up later, or maybe I am missing something important. But after experimenting with the synthesis for an hour, I don't think so.\n\nI have played through the first three hours hoping that there would come a point where I would get something other than a slow ranged fireball/iceball attack. I was disappointed. The contagion ranged attack was even worse. The other spell types set you up for failure with slow casting times and the fact that you die in about four hits if your enemies get near you. There is a lot available in the way of customization as far as spell effects are concerned. Unfortunately the effects are almost entirely negligible.","April 7, 2014","false","11.1"," 5 of 19 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","5","19","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asatruer/recommended/261760/","Asatruer","Asatruer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Asatruer/","674 products in account","An intense FPSesque combat game with a fantasy setting. Has more similarity to such ancient Doom era (and engine) games Heretic and Hexen, and with the Diablo series than it does with an RPG. Level design is very aesthetically pleasing, but linear with a few explorative branches for loot and or extra challenges. The voice actors are great and plotline is good, but not great and does feel as though it ends abruptly in such a way to lead into a sequel to wrap things up. The combat and spell crafting are what makes the game rather enjoyable and worth experiencing.\nGreat for someone looking for intense magical combat rather than a deeply immersive role-playing experience.\nThe combat is straightforward with no resource management (no ammo/mana  other than a recharging shield) and relies blocking and teleporting for defense and for offense switching between three Sigils (like elements) each with a single target, a targeted area of effect, and a self radiating nova (from a good block or charged teleport). The basic projectile attack can be crafted with three different shapes, one for the basic shot that has a small amount of auto-aim, one for a lobbed bomb that explodes into smaller bursts for a semi-AoE, and a shorter ranged spraying ray. Similarly the Area power can be crafted into three shapes, a basic AoE, a radiating pool that hits anything that passes into it, and an exploding trap. Each spell is crafted with Augments onto the Shapes that dictate not only bonuses, but also the spell's attunement to either Damage, Control, or Mastery. Damage is self explanatory, and Control is pretty standard hold/paralyze effect, but Mastery is a bit more complex working often as a debuff, but always as a way to build up extra potential critical damage. Hit a target with a control attuned spell to lock it down, then a mastery spell to increase the critical damage, and finally a charged damage spell for 100% critical chance and watch the fireworks. The basic elemental Sigils (Fire, Ice, Lightning, and Kinetic) each influence the shape of the spell in subtle ways to give many options for building together various combos of spells that work well together, and it can be fun (though sometimes a bit daunting) to sort out which of the many permutations work best for you. The more advanced Sigils (Corruption, Delirium, Necromancy, and Phase) start behaving a bit more radically different in how they work. Even your character's shield (this games equivalent for hit points) is craftable with various shapes to help tailor your combat tactics ranging from fewer teleport blinks but more hit points for the tank playstyle to less hit points and unlimited blinks for more active and mobile dodger playstyle.\nThe crafting loot is one of the places where the game takes after the likes of Diablo, with the loot drops from mobs being these building blocks of Shapes and Augments used to craft spells, with the level of the loot as well as its colored rarity dictating how powerful of a spell you can end up crafting with it. Another is the bad guys can spawn with the occasional affix that grants it some perks like knockdown or faster attacks, radiating damage, or even making fellows invulnerable.","February 2, 2015","true","53.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I survived that instance of random fight or die situation, so because of that randomness and lack of understanding It felt like a scary movie where I had to poke everything in the eye with my crappy fire balls or nothing was going to be okay (and thats all I knew). It was fun.  I hope to see more spell effects. For instance the fire manipulation magic could have an interesting concept about "controlling" things that are "set" on fire *wink wink* thrown in there some how. just as an example, pay no mind to the random idea. Love the game, And I loved super smash bros. for me that is saying something. I can't play the game though because it feels very linear, I don't know what is going on story wise and the spells are slow and feel clunky for as little as they do. Alot of the time i am just running marathons backwards for days without any other reason besides waiting for the damage to rack up high enough to kill the freakin braindead zombie. I am sure you guys are going to murder the game (in a good way) and i will be playing more and more with each update for sure.

And this is for all spells, not just your initial Fire and Ice powers. Granted, each spell has different effects and can be uniquely upgraded, but at the end of the day you are still just shooting the same 4 spells. For a game that is designed to make you feel all powerful, it instead makes you feel limited to what you can actually do.\n\nThis game has amazing potential. Whether it will live up to it is unknown. I have high hopes for this game, which is why I would still recommend it in spite of the combat system.

For me the game played like your basic run and gun only replace bullets with fire balls. The game play is enough to keep you playing for most of the game but it gets boring fighing the same enimies over and over again. The game has very little story told to you most of it is hidden in journal entries so it is difficult to feel any conection with any of the characters then the game just ends leaving you haning. Though what you get from the story leaves you wanting more but they never seem to really give it to you and there are a couple time where characters seem to die off screen. While there is no mana bar or cool downs to limit you to get your "spells" full effect you have to charge it there by limiting you in other ways. The you can't cast and block at the same time. For each sigil type there are only three spells you can access at one time.\nIf you can get this game on sale I totally recommend this game because it is fun.","January 27, 2015","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, if you answer yes to all the above mentioned than this game is for you.\n\nOn a more serious and detailed note though.\n\nGameplay:\nLichdom: Battlemage is a unique game in the sense that the gameplay is structured purely on magic and the good thing is that you don't need to worry about manna. The game has a complex and in-depth spell-crafting system, at the first sight that it is. There are only 9 base spells (which you unlock as you progress through the game) that have 3 features - Ranged attack, area attack and block. The spells can be further attuned through various application of various shapes (e.g. lob, homing missile, trap etc) and modifiers (destruction, mastery or control). This sounds heavy and possibility reach right? but just like in Borderlands, you have a variety of guns with only few good ones, the same is with spell. All you need is a good destruction spell and a good mastery spell (enemies hit with mastery spell take extra critical damage once they are hit with a destruction spell).\nIn your spells you use two hands, and the inability to assign different spells to each hand is very annoying, even more annoying than the inability to equip more than 3 spells in total :(\n\nGraphics:\nVisually the game is good, but not as good as it could have been given the fact that it runs on CryEngine 3.

Just go mod some spells into Skyrim for a more satisfying and cheaper alternative.\n\nLichdom: Battlemage is really all about building your spells. Yeah, you can cast them too, but the combat is really nothing new; if you've played Bioshock and The Elder Scrolls, then you know how this game plays. Lichdom is those, but without physical weapons, and it's linear.\n\nThe problem with spell building in this game is the lack of explanation. There are really uninformative tutorials about "Control Attunement" and "Mastery Attunement." Basically, they make the enemy take more damage, and one ensnares them. But these extra effects don't happen 100% of the time, and Master and Control get consumed by... uh... something and then damage gets stored and... um destruction spells (of which there are more than Fire I guess?) go more damage and release the pent up damage.\n\nExcept that this uncertain chain of events that you glean from shooting spells around doesn't even happen all the time, and the game doesn't even start you with the spells having their intended function. For example, the game plays a tutorial that says the Kinesis Spell should ensnare an enemy (make them unable to move). I lob my Kinesis at a charging monster, and he's like "LOL THAT FELT CUTE" and blades my in the nads.\n\nWait, what? What did I miss? There's Mastery Tutorial, Control Tutorial... What's the actual difference between them, and how should they be used? Why do the enemies sometimes get the sigils above their heads? How does that sigil get there? Oh look, I just killed one with the sigil above its head and my spell does more damage temporarily, neat. Why does a freeze ray freeze the enemy, but the freeze missile doesn't? How come in the tutorial video it freezes the enemy but when I cast it, there's no freezing? What do the two bars mean during a boss battle? Red is health, but what is the green one?\n\nWhen crafting a spell, do I have to worry about attunement? Well the Contagion spell says it's affected by it, so probably. How do I do that, and why would I choose Mastery over Control? How come when I freeze an enemy they take extra damage from Fire but not Lighting?\n\n*** The game iteself never really explains any of this, which is a big problem considering that this is the entire freaking point of the game.***\n\nSo, the one important way that this game is different from Skyrim or Bioshock has been obscured by a complete lack of explanation. So, you're probably going to end up turning on Smart Inventory, which is a mode specially included for people that don't want to spend their weekends reading FAQs on how/why/min-maxing. It basically does all the inventory management and upgrading for you.\n\nBut then it's like, "What's the point of playing this game?" It's got a plot worse than Bioshock, and a spell list smaller than Skyrim. However, without this mode the game is neigh un-playable due to all the mechanics that aren't explained.\n\nI would regard this game as a proof of concept. It has the ":", which tends to imply sequels. It is only worth getting this game in 2 circumstances: 1) you like extra-cirricular research and 2) you don't like starting a series at the 2nd installment, and you feel the need to actually play the first one to get a 'full immersion' in to the universe. Nothing wrong with that, if in fact the sequel is a game that is THAT good.","January 17, 2015","false","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All come with their own way of attack, defence and support.\nThe magic is spectacular and every hit has a amazing satisfaction along with it, although the game starts off rather limited on spells and the tuturial is rather long but as you play you grow to become more powerful as you upgrade and add effects and a new status to every spell.\n\nThere are three ways of casting Basic hand shoot, Nova and AOE. the basic one is shooting spells from the casters hand and that can cause magic to be casted as a direct missile, homing missile and or lobbing. Nova is the spell in which is activated via Shield burst or Aimed Blinking. AOE is area of effect and pretty self explanatory as its a spell you shoot from the sky and does a either a burst of magic, lingering effect or trap.\n\nBlinking is a basic power in which you teleport a short distance and is very useful when dodging, Another thing is that your character doesn't really die as there are checkpoints in the game rather than saving as when the character runs out of their shield they will be teleported to the checkpoint in which they can retry to the battle.\n\nThats the basic of the game but i really recommend to who evers reading this to play if they like action adventures with a hint of some open world as well as magic games like skyrim or magicka.

I have heard someone complaining about kiting the first boss and taking 15 minutes to kill it in one go, yet when I encountered that same boss it took me two minutes (using lightning missiles with an agility shield). This game has a great many playstyle options to choose from, and it may take a little bit trying to figure out which style matches you. But once you find that style... my god. This game will make you feel like a god.\n\nFor me, my chosen theme was high-damage lightning bolts with an agility shield, allowing me to quickly dodge about the battlefield. A particularly awesome moment for me was during the third boss fight (no spoilers), where the deafening cracking sounds and the blinding flashes of white light literally disintergrated groups of enemies into satisfying puffs of black smote were so awe-inspiring, because I knew that it was me that was causing such chaotic destruction.\n\nThe story too was awesome. The developers put quite a lot of personality into the two main characters and, indeed, many of the villians you will encounter. I also appreciate the uniqueness of the whole situation. Instead of the usual cliché that a medieval fantasy would spin, this game seems to add a whole dose of reality to the world that your characters live in. The world seems very tactile, very real, despite being a set of linear pathways. Plus, the environments are absolutely stunning to look at.\n\nAs to the things I didn't like about this game? Well...\n- Sometimes the dialog would bug out and mute, and characters would bug out, if I reached a destination too fast.\n- I had an awesome legendary spell component, and I decided to upgrade it once more to make it even more powerful, and the random number generator spat out an item that I couldn't actually use, thus destroying the awesomeness that was. (This only happened once, but it was still annoying)\n- While fighting 20 enemies at once can get pretty hectic, especially if you have archers, wizards and giant demon monsters who can all kill you rather fast... Fighting even more enemies would be even more awesome :D\n\n9.5/10 - Will play through again. Willing to pay for a sequel.\n(-0.5 for my negatives at the end there)","September 2, 2014","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

How many hordes of undead can you take before it gets repetitive? Turns out that the answer is way more than the game currently offers. The hordes keep getting bigger, the bosses bigger and badder. And when it comes down to it I just can't get enough. I have lost myself for hours in the quest to make the undead wish they were still dead. The spells seemed limited but at second glance the crafting makes so many options available that it fits a ton of play styles. This isn't your Warfare or alien FPS this here is Battlemage. And it is the standard for what any game should try to be. There is no army you are taking point for, there is no team. It's you vs the world, And the world shall burn. Revenge shall be yours. The places you go are amazing the things you kill are ugly. But the most important. Your spells are godly. There is no other way to explain it. You walk into the game. And from start to finish you lay waste to everything you ever thought the denizens of hell would be and then some that are just annoying enough to keep it satisfying to watch them burn to ash in front of your eyes. If you pass up this game you pass up everything that is Badassery. Buy it. Ravage it.

Spell crafting includes a wide variety of sigils, or energy-types, like fire, ice, time (phase), and necromancy. These enrgy-types are crafted into "shapes" like a ray, homing-missle, area-affect, shield. The spell shape is then given an additional layer of effect by an "augment" focusing on destruction (damage), control (paralyzing emeies), and mastery (stacking damage with a sigil-specific special effect). Additional, you collect a wide array of these different components, each with their own bonuses, which can then be combined to increase their rarity and effect. The result is a very rewarding game of exploring spells and experimenting with the results of these combinations.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the fun of this game ends. With an uncompelling story, the painfully liniar route quickly has you begging for anything different, until the different appears. The linear routes are replete with magically poofing-in enemies in clearly delineated battle arenas connected by short narrow walking paths from one to the next. As predictable as it gets, until one member of the third identical wave of enemies spawns in right behind you. Five enemy types over and over again: archer, swordsman, mage (archer who teleports), wraith (flying enemy with an unblockable freeze attack), and "captain" (one of the previous types with tripple-health and boosted damage). After your fifth arena battle of cheapness on both sides, you're ready for a change... the bosses. Unfortunately, boss battles just turn into drawn-out pattern matching endurance games. 1: Spam damage. 2: Retreat and kill small mobs. 3: Dodge. 4: Rinse and repeat.\n\nThis whole leaves you nothing but frustation, unless you happened to already know the best spell combos, in which case you're just blowing through everything. Unfortunately, if you DIDN'T already know those combos, it will take a LONG time to re-collect enough components to craft a new set, now that you know what you SHOULD HAVE done with those spells. Realizing that your best option is to start the game over, you will most likely quickly decide against going through the same linear repetitive grind, just to try a new spell combo.\n\nI really wish the story and journey had been better thought-out.","December 22, 2014","false","19.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ambient is good, there is an interesting story (Not the "Holy mother of god" kind of story, but it's good), rather unique fantasy world and a lot of bad guys to kill.\n\nLet me explain a bit how it works... You got 8 elements of magic, you can use only 1 of them at same time and have other 2 as a backup for making combos or trying different attacks. Each element can be used only to block, attack and area-attack. 3 different kinds of behaviours for your spells, combined with 3 different effects (Offensive, passive and debuff), if you want to go full offensive, forget the other 2. Once you get the hang on this spellcrafting sistem, you are all set to defeat the evil cult and kills all the bad guys.\n\nAs far the only real problems I see in this game is... The fact that the story is lineal, but that's not that much of a problem, maybe I just got too used to open-world games and a real serious problem is terrible FPS. My PC isn't exactly a gem from the world of all the modern machines, but specs are above the minimal requirement and still, FPS drops can be really brutal sometimes and I hope the devs will fix that in the future. Otherwise than that, this is a good game and I do reccommend it.","January 2, 2015","true","24.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the way the game looks and feels and handles even though it is in early Beta.\nI was excited about this game when I first heard about it a year ago (Atleast 6 months now) and the first comparison that I was given about it was Skyrim's magic with better graphics. It so far fits my first image of it and I am positive that it will only get better now that it has entered it's beta stage.\nI may not have played much of it (Because it was in early Alpha and didn't have much aswell as me just not having the time to play it) but every moment that I have spent in this world that was so beautifully crafted just left me in awe of how well the creators did in piecing together the game.\nI'm not saying that this is the pinacle of gaming or that this is without any faults (Which of course would be strait out lying) but the sheer beauty that this game holds and the interesting gameplay mechanics come together in an odd harmony that just makes you want to play this game more.\nThis is a game that Is worth supporting and I hope that it remains strong until the very end.","July 22, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lichdom is really fun to play, like most other rpg, Lichdom too has really high learning curve and in the beginning you are dying a lot, but the good thing is that the game doesnt punish you for dying, okay you have this loot thing when you are playing long time without dying, your loot rate increases, when you die, your loot rate resest, but thats about it, you can keep all your sigils that you have found and eveerything else.\n\nSo about gameplay, its really fun to play, hard but fun, and when you progress in your game you find much more rare sigils and then you can begin to make your own sigils, the thing is, there is no ''OMG OP DROPPING PLANET METEORA STORM'' spells, if you are looking those kind of spells you might wanna see some else game, but if you like combining and fast spell weawering mage that has no ''minute waiting'' casting times and no mana bars then you have a right game, its just fun to play. You can blow zombies with a fire spells, then cast lighting spell that freezes everyone that comes close enough and then finish them of with plague spell that literally dissolves everything, its more tactical when you have to switch between spells in the air and more fun, than just waiting 2 minutes to make huge meteor strike and then wait 15 minutes its cooldown like in most of rpg mages\n\nBut like i said, learning curve is pretty high, and making/ combining sigils, can be at first little hard, but you have to explore and thats i like in Lichdom, the battle system is deep and you have to study your magic sigils, there is some minor graphic bugs but the game itself runs really smooth and looks amazing, especially if you have high graphic settings.\n\nReally good and entertaining game that i can recomend everyone those who loves magic and badass mages :DD","August 10, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And a very linear game with no adventure aspect.\n\nAs I played more of the game I found that there were still only 3 or 4 models but having built games before I know adding new enemies is very easy.\n\nThe depth of gameplay I am laying on only having played one level.  I feel that the two levels that I have played are functioning very similar to the opening to Skyrim, where the player is slowly walked through a the mechanics of the game.  I will have to wait until more of the game is avaliable to know.\n\nAgain the linear aspect I am going to put on the lack of levels to play.  But this again is something very easy to fix once you have the artwork done for the levels.\n\n\nI give the game a 5/10, but it's still pre-alpha and a lot better than other games I've played in the past.","May 15, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have always like the magic(ians) part in the whole fairy taily stuff. It is probably what draw me and my imagination towards this and those of you who are like minded or power junkies will find falling in love with this game experience waaay easier.\n\nIn general the spell crafting is the core joy. There is a learning curve that took me some research onine on forums but once I stumbled up on a straigh forward guide i realise how simple and yet complex and wide ad the same time the spell system is.\n\nI can put your fears in rest if you are worried that those folks complaining about lack of spells and choices are strumming that as the game progresses you will gain interesting spells from the clasical fire or ice, to phasing or necromancy etc.\n\nWhat youy make of them is up to. But rest assured that you will feel like someone who has discovered how the magic works and you will sudennly turn into spell afixes and prefixes seeking geek who just wants more of the mastery augments to get that effect right.\n\nSo have fun.

I had also been craving a game with some crafting there can be alot in this game each spell is crafted by 3 different parts... but those parts can be crafted and upgraded, and torn apart... There is tons to do with your spells which is great because is the only gear in the game. You have 3 spells and 3 different element types of magic at a time. so  you are rotating between 9 spells, and you blink and have a charged blink depending on your shield type. There are definitely alot of spell posibilites/combos. Right now I am enjoying infesting mobs with spores and then keeping them frozen until the spores reach maturity then kiling the mob releasing the spores into the air muahahahaha.","September 23, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have heard someone complaining about kiting the first boss and taking 15 minutes to kill it in one go, yet when I encountered that same boss it took me two minutes (using lightning missiles with an agility shield). This game has a great many playstyle options to choose from, and it may take a little bit trying to figure out which style matches you. But once you find that style... my god. This game will make you feel like a god.\n\nFor me, my chosen theme was high-damage lightning bolts with an agility shield, allowing me to quickly dodge about the battlefield. A particularly awesome moment for me was during the third boss fight (no spoilers), where the deafening cracking sounds and the blinding flashes of white light literally disintergrated groups of enemies into satisfying puffs of black smote were so awe-inspiring, because I knew that it was me that was causing such chaotic destruction.\n\nThe story too was awesome. The developers put quite a lot of personality into the two main characters and, indeed, many of the villians you will encounter. I also appreciate the uniqueness of the whole situation. Instead of the usual cliché that a medieval fantasy would spin, this game seems to add a whole dose of reality to the world that your characters live in. The world seems very tactile, very real, despite being a set of linear pathways. Plus, the environments are absolutely stunning to look at.\n\nAs to the things I didn't like about this game? Well...\n- Sometimes the dialog would bug out and mute, and characters would bug out, if I reached a destination too fast.\n- I had an awesome legendary spell component, and I decided to upgrade it once more to make it even more powerful, and the random number generator spat out an item that I couldn't actually use, thus destroying the awesomeness that was. (This only happened once, but it was still annoying)\n- While fighting 20 enemies at once can get pretty hectic, especially if you have archers, wizards and giant demon monsters who can all kill you rather fast... Fighting even more enemies would be even more awesome :D\n\n9.5/10 - Will play through again. Willing to pay for a sequel.\n(-0.5 for my negatives at the end there)","September 2, 2014","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the way the game looks and feels and handles even though it is in early Beta.\nI was excited about this game when I first heard about it a year ago (Atleast 6 months now) and the first comparison that I was given about it was Skyrim's magic with better graphics. It so far fits my first image of it and I am positive that it will only get better now that it has entered it's beta stage.\nI may not have played much of it (Because it was in early Alpha and didn't have much aswell as me just not having the time to play it) but every moment that I have spent in this world that was so beautifully crafted just left me in awe of how well the creators did in piecing together the game.\nI'm not saying that this is the pinacle of gaming or that this is without any faults (Which of course would be strait out lying) but the sheer beauty that this game holds and the interesting gameplay mechanics come together in an odd harmony that just makes you want to play this game more.\nThis is a game that Is worth supporting and I hope that it remains strong until the very end.","July 22, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I will say that there is no tutorial for the spell crafting side, other than longwinded descriptions in the journal that really arn't that informative or helpful (or exciting for that matter).\n\nWith a few video guides (not a lot out there at the moment (look for a guy called F3TTST3R_GAMES on youtube for a 101 on crafting) it becomes much clearer, but I kind of hoped that the crafting mechanic would have some kind of guiding help in there as it is a pretty big system and a core mechanic of the game. If there is a guide built into the game and I have missed it then this is just as bad as it was not obvious on any level and I am the typically experienced gamer.\n\nIf this is fixed and the system becomes more user friendly (there was a point that I had levelled up 6 times without noticing that I had points to spend because the UI is so cluttered and even then I really wasn't too sure what my invested points did in some cases) then the game will be very unique and extremely good fun.\n\nIt is a little repetitive, but this should be alleivated with the crafting mechanic, essentially finding new and better ways (read fun) of putting the enemies down once I have a better grasp of it. The story is a little loose and entirely linear, albeit a few caves here and there to nip into to find health.\n\nI really do want this game to be great, the concept is unique in a very hard to be unique category which I love. However, I do feel that the linear story line does wreck it a little for me.\n\nOverall I would definitely recommend playing Lichdom (although again, where does the lichdom title come from? Other than being dead/resurrected you actually play as a dragon... not a lich, or at least a dracolich if you are?). However, I definitely feel that Lichdom 2 should be much better once the team have a little more experience with this concept.\n\nPositives:\n\nUnique play style\nPretty but laggy all over the show (a PC restart after install fixed most of this)\nFun and creative\n\nImprovements that I would like to see:\n\nLess linear play - sandbox style RPG world would make this game mindblowing\nMore intuitive crafting system\nLess cluttered crafting UI\n\n\nThis review does sound negative but it really is a good game with a LOT of potential.

The game looked too frenetic to me. If the trailer was the only soruce of information, I would not buy the game. Luckily, it wasn't.\n\nLichdom: Battlemage is a fantasy action game. You are a mage who is not limited with the amount of mana. A powerful mage who can destroy thousand of enemies, yet can't jump nor swim. You do not have a sword either, so casting spells is the only way you can fight enemies.\n\nThere are 8 sigils in the game, each with three spells- Nova, a spell activated when you defend yourself, Targeted spell, which is a standart one and AOE- Area of Effect spell. Each spell can be atunned to destruction, control and mastery. The effects of these attunements vary from sigil to sigil, but in general it's reccommended to combine them in order to hurt your enemies more.\n\nThe powers of sigils can be combined, which is the main fun of the game in my opinion. For example, I casted a time bubble on an enemy, which absorbs damage from other spells. Then I casted a spell which sends bugs to the enemy, eating them alive from within. Finally, I used a teleport spell. The enemy was teared apart with it. The bugs then went to other enemies, hurting and teleporting them through the battlefield.\n\nYou can also craft your own spells from resources you'll find on the way, upgrade the spells and even the resources and craft synergies. Synergies are spells which combines power of two sigils. They can summon powerfull creatures or deal huge damage to enemies.\n\nIn general, this game is very good. Yes, it can get sometimes a bit repetetive and the levels are basically corridors with few other ways to go. I think the story can't stand on it's own, it serves more like a motivation to go further, killing enemies down the road. But this is a debut of Xavian, and as such is really good. I reccommend this game.","April 6, 2015","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First of all game looks awesome, level design is awesome, spell effects are awesome, enemy animations are awesome, everything concerning the looks is great, and that's why this game looks so bloody amazing on screenshots. But damn I had no fun playing it. Maybe it's my fault - I did expect a painkiller/serious sam type game with magic, but I got something else. The mage moves like a crippled turtle, which is extremely annoying. The spell crafting is needlessly complex and the tutorials are just kinda missing, instead they give you a smart inventory and say - just use it, don't go into details. And the most dissapointing thing for me was the way the magic is equipped - it's like they are restricting you from combining different spells. Maybe it's me, but I did not find any way to put for example freez ray on LMB and fireball on RMB - just to make things easier, instead you are forced to switch sigils, which gets annoying fast and just no fun at all. I enjoy the difficulty in the games, but not when it comes from broken controls.\n\nSee? All the negatives about this game are so minor and so easy to fix, but damn those 3 little things reduce all the fun nearly to zero. Just give a simplier crafting system, faster movement and ability to custom assign spells and voila! The game would be perfect, but now the gameplay is just no fun... at least for me.\n\nPS I will gladly change this review into a positive one after the developers will give the ability to custom assign spells\n\nPPS changed the rating to positive after few hours, because i literally felt bad for giving a negative review. anyway I hope that mentioned issues will be fixed one day","April 9, 2015","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not a bad game but I didn't find it particularly good either.\n\nThe story is pretty basic, as least as far as I got. You, Generic Townsperson, were hanging out doing one day doing townsfolky things when your relative was tragically killled by Lord Evilguy and his evil followers, the Cult of Evil. You then gain magic powers and set out to kill Lord Evilguy and avenge your beloved <InsertRelativeNameHere>. There are a few other cutscenes along the way but they don't seem to tell us much we don't already know.\n\nLevel design is also fairly straightforward - the entire game seems to be one long corridor with the occasional short sidepath, although it looks decent enough.\n\nThe combat is clearly the meat of the game, but for me it just wasn't that interesting. A lot of people who like the game will claim that if someone doesn't like the combat, it's because they're "doing it wrong" - they don't know how to combine spells properly and just throw the one fireball spell over and over. In my case I don't think that's true. I've seen the videos, I've read a couple of guides, I'm using the mastery and control spells, I'm using my blink and block, and I still dodn't find it terribly exciting.\n\nGenerally, spells work best if you charge them up a bit, and it usually takes several spells to kill an enemy - at the very least, applying "mastery" (which increases the power of subsequent hits) and/or a control spell before going for damage is normal. Combine with the fact that the game doesn't really require precision aim - the standard bolt spell actually homes in on enemies! - and combat felt a little sluggish to me.\n\nCompounding this is that there is a lot of combat, but all the enemies and environments seem to be basically the same. Once you've got your combos down, the only thing that brings any variety to combat is that enemies spawn with random "affixes", similar to the unique monsters in games like Diablo or Path of Exile. This make choosing which enemies to prioritise important - which I assume is what they were aiming for, since there's not a huge emphasis on manual dexterity - but I didn't find it enough to prevent combat become repetitive fairly quickly. Some of the spell effects are pretty flashy if you like that sort thing, however.\n\nThe other major part of the game is the crafting system, which is potentially interesting but more of a chore than it needs to be. Prepare to spend a lot of time on inventory management, because you're going to amass large piles of junk which you'll need to sort though using an interface which could be better. Again, it's not the worst but it could have been better. If you're really into min-maxing and comparing stats you'll probably love it, though.\n\nOverall I think this game is competent but underwhelming. It doesn't really have glaring faults, but I just couldn't get into it. If you love flashy special effects or complicated crafting systems and don't mind a bit of repetition you might get more out of it than I did.","April 5, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is simply awesome!\n\nMany complain the boss fights are too hard, but they seem to misunderstand that whilst you ARE a badass battlemage - the game requires the player to think, and craft and strategise to fully realise your potential.\n\nIt's not wacka mole.\n\nIf you wanna hit the fire button and watch stuff die look elsewhere. This is a deceptively thoughtful game where you need a deep understanding of how spell sigils work, and the ability to use synergies between their different effects. If you are prepared to put a bit of thought into continuously upgrading your spells, and experimenting to see how each spell type affects another, the rewards are truly spectacular. Previously tough enemies will now vaporise before your eyes in fiery deaths that truly give you the feeling of omnipotent power.\n\nI have played no other game that allows you to carve a such a trail of destruction of destruction is so many different styles. Wanna be fast, agile and avoid pain - got you covered. Wanna fight in your face toe to toe tank style - no problem. Kitey ranged attacks - yep, battlefield general with minions doing the dirty work - sure... charm mage turning enemies against each other - yeah fine. Manipulate time and control foes - sure. There's also basics like fire, ice and lightning, plus change between all these styles whenever you want by just swapping out sigils and crafting new spells.\n\nThis is what the developers meant when they claimed thousands of spells for the game, and discovering all the ways to combine and synergise them is a ton of fun with each causing new and epic visual and sound effects as hoards of enemies fall before your wrath.\n\nSome complain the game is too linear. It's true, there is one path with small branches for exploration that gives loot and story bonuses, but for me, better a well crafted path with increasing complexity and a well developed story and difficulty curve than a sprawling open world of tedious wanderings. I haven't finished the game yet so I can't comment fully on the story, but so far it's been enjoyable (if a little formulaic) and told in an iteresting series of flashbacks from a past incarnation of a previous battlemage.\n\nTL;DR\nThis game requires some effort and thought to get the most out of it (which seems to have put many off), but if you want one of the most varied battle systems with impressive and spectacular results look no further. Above all this game is a ton of FUN and becomming a true badass has never been so satisfying.","February 21, 2015","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
