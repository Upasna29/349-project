The game has got alot of potential; but right now it's deep in devlopment. Don't come in expecting too much currently; the game is super barebones. The premise is simple enough; Dropped into a random world naked, alone and vulnerable. Mine your way to house, to a farm, to safety. Right now you can make pretty detailed looking houses, but inside it's pretty sparce; the underground sections offer up spice to the gameplay, and the many bees that attack during the day add somewhat of a challenge.\n\nI'll be updating this review as dev goes on. Right now, I feel it's worth the price, especially since Multiplayer is coming at some point. Pick this up if you're looking for a fun SP experience (Albeit with little to do) or for a future MP game. It's an investment for a quality product!","October 27, 2014","true","55.0"," 41 of 59 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","41","59","0","8"

It's just 5 dollers at this moment! So why not give it a try?\nEdit:There has been an EXTREME lack of updates, like the first update I remember, was when it released on steam, I recommend people be very careful before buying this as a result.","January 11, 2015","true","1.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","13","20","6","0"

I think it has a lot of potential. I've played for around an hour and a half to two hours, mostly because it just doesn't hold my attention a whole lot longer than that. That's partly expected because it's in early access though. With time I'm sure the game will mature into something very fun to explore and play with. I did have some issues with the game, and I go more into detail about that in a video review on YouTube.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/iZOf4EcLkI4","February 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

It's early, but functional. I'm impressed with proposed graphics for it.\n\nOnly my opinion, but I think there's oodles of potential in a builder game that looks like an old-school 2D RPG, especially if multiplayer is being added, the graphics look like traditional, Japanese RPGs.\n\nI see the potential for a host of possibilities, including appealing to an audience that loves old RPG artwork, by including countless craftable items, clothes, furniture and more.\n\nNot too mention if the possibility of modding is ever introduced in a way, say, Minecraft is moddable. That would expand the appeal tremendously if you can start including functional pipes, oil, engines and the like, similar to the way modding has blown-up around other building games.\n\nOr add a little bit of Terraria progression by having multiple underground levels, each increasingly difficult with better ore and items to get.\n\nThis base framework functions and embarrassing or not, I've blown 7 hours just chopping trees and digging so far in its current state.\n\nI look forward to the possibility of more varied terrain, better graphics, and lots and lots more items and activities to take part it!","February 24, 2015","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

This would add a lot of potential that the dev can't fulfill all the time. Just a thought doe. Anyways, to the review!\n\nOkay, so I haven't ever seen an upstarter game that I ever thought could I have potential besides Terraria, but this does. This has a LOT of potential. But unless the developer works soon, it may not see it. What it needs is more ores, and more levels of mining. Not just one, it has to have at least 10 levels, and the bottom level be some kind of underworld. It needs a lot more ores, biomes, etc. There is also a rare glitch where sometimes when you spawn, you're in the middle of the ocean... yeah, that sucks. But Multiplayer will SERIOUSLY add awesomeness to the max. But, there needs to be things to make multiplayer become mainstream. #1, the developer needs to look at Minecraft for inspiration. Famous servers in MC have things in common, Texture packs, custom named items/potions, and redstone contraptions. This game needs these three things to become, well, AWESOMER THAN POSSIBLE! Well... in my opinion :3\n\nNow then, there needs to be an elevation system too. Jumping higher and higher, bla bla bla. This can add some amazing builds, and cool land features. A minimap would be nice too. Sprint ability is a must. But yeah, I realize this is Early Access, so what am I saying anyways? XD\n\nPoint is, if you have the money, GET THIS GAME. This game needs it, it will become great but remember that what this dev needs is money. Thanks for reading B-T-Dubz, :P :D\n\nedit: Just read over my review...
