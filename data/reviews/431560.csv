"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jet14/recommended/431560/","jet14","Kiatus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jet14/","81 products in account","NOTE: This copy was given to me by the developer for review purposes, this however does not change the review in anyway.\n\nOverviewHardRoom is a game where you play as one of the many self-developing AI's built by the greatest minds of the world. You're aim is to pass the obstacles and reach the other side, touching a block which makes more obstacles, building from the previous obstacles to show your unknown master who's the best.\n\nQualityGraphics - HardRoom has a very smooth and pretty art style, the banners they used to advertise the game were drawn greatly and I applaud the developers for this!\n\nAudio - The soundtrack used in HardRoom is quite catchy, but can get repetitive since there is only one piece of music, especially in that time where you're stuck on the puzzle you just can't pass. I would recommend muting the music and getting your own if you get bored.\n\nGameplay - The game is really simple to understand as I explained it before, you have to cross to the other side by going through many obstacles. The thing that adds to the hardness is the high sensetivity . The controls themselves are really easy as they are your traditional WASD or your traditional arrow keys.\n\n\nPros & ConsPros:\n• Concept | The concept of this game is so popular, yet so unique, of how they used obstacles but put it all in one room instead of a Mario-like layouts a very smart and rare in their obstacle games.\n• Art Style | The art style in HardRoom has a very nice touch, and not only have they done that in game but also on their advertising banners which makes want to put the thumbs up for this one!\n• Has Cards and Achievements | Not only have  the developers made a great game, they've also made cards and achievements to go with it. This is great, so that customers can try to achieve something else if they finish all the levels and also get some money (cards) for completing the game. It's a win-win situation!\n• Gameplay and Price | For the price of $1.99, you get around 3-4 Hours depending on how you handle the puzzles, whether you go all out or if you take a break every once and a while, it goes up to how long it'll take you to finish it.\n\nCons:\n• Doesn't run on Steam Client Beta | For those who test Steam Client beta everyday to help give suggestions to steam or to experience the fixes that steam gives everyday, HardRoom doesn't work in beta, which is why the game doesn't start up why I had beta on.\n\n\nConclusionHardRoom is an awesome game that will last you a few good hours of not many, yet some additions could be made, such as being able to run on Steam Client Beta. Overall, it's a very well done game and I'm glad the green light community made a good choice! :)\n7/10^^My rating (will change if they make a difference in future updates.)\n\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","January 31","true","2.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","11","14","4","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itzemii/recommended/431560/","itzemii","Itzemii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itzemii/","1425 products in account","One-room 2D jump and run with frustrating (controller) control mechanism.\n\nCharacter has to be moved from left to right and right to left to push a button. Each press of a button creates new platforms, enemies,  traps etc. in the middle, making the path between the buttons more difficult.\nVery hard, as the same path, becomming more and more difficult has to be "jumped-and-runed" again and again.\n\nFrustrating control. I use XBox controller.\nMenu is only usable with mouse, exit only possible via ESC key. Inconvenient, when sitting on the couch and the keyboard is miles away.\nMost problematic is the partly non-responsive control mechanism; pressing the jump button quite often reacts with a delay. In addition the movement is too fast without giving the feel and actual control. Note: Other very hard games, like Meatboy for me do provide a much better control, being a no brainer, where the levels themselves make it hard.\n\nVerdict: Innovative, good game mechanism. Non-responsive (controller) control did not make it fun for me.","March 29","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game is a "Hardcore " Indie game, to literraly make you mad and want to exit, BUT , it's addicted to play cause you want to "Pass al the levels" to be proud of you (talking by my self). The game is almost all of wath I said before.\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Funny;\n- Interesting;\n- Creative;\n-  Kind of a annoying game, but still adictable to play.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- It's annoying , so it make you want to smash your computer;\n- Still really buggy.\n\nMy reccomendation:  Reccomended, if you like hard games","June 3","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game demands precise control time after time, but there is no ramp up period for speed.  It's full blast, instantly, and no means of slowing down.\n\nThe game gets increasingly irritating as you are required to play the same opening stage every time you die.  We get it, I screwed up, and hit a spike.  Now I have to run to the right again, then to the left over a pit, then to the right again over the same pit with spikes.\n\nYou get to a point where you repeat the same actions from muscle memory until you get to the new part of the stage, where you immediately screw it up as you learn it, and have to start over.  The game is unfortunately, almost fun.  Add a practice mode, or checkpoints, or some form of forgiveness where you beat a level 10 times without dying, don't make me do it again!","May 30","false","0.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Basic and difficult. There's not a lot to the game, and 90% of the difficulty comes from the controls. (There's only one speed of movement, even with a controller.) Plus there's virtually no options. There's an enable cheats option, but I'm pretty sure it does nothing.\n\nBut, at least the level design is ok, and the core concept of the game is a neat one. The art style is nice too. It only has one track of music, but it is a decent one.","May 19","false","0.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"
