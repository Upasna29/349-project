But WOW...this game is bad. The graphics are fine, the customization is great, but the core of a motocross game is the physics, and the physics this game has are extremely bad.  Wish they wouldve just stuck with thr reflex engine, would have been a decent game... oh well.","April 27, 2015","false","4.2"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","44","57","2","1"

It feels dated, the controls are bad, the physics are so far off it feels sluggish and sloppy. Before its release, I watched a video where the devs stated the track width was widened to make it easier on new players to the franchise, this is a lie. It was widened because the controls are so sloppy, wonky that pro riders probably couldnt negotiate a tighter track. There are NO features in play for PC, no graphics settings, aside from resolution, and the optimization is worse than ♥♥♥♥ poor, its non existant. This whole game was phoned in, much of the gear is re-hashed straight from earlier titles. The devs on this game didnt fail, in order to fail you have to try. This game shows no improvements over past Mx Vs ATV titles. I feel bad for spending money on this title, I feel bad for getting my hopes up. THIS GAME IS PATHETIC, ITS A BAD JOKE. If there is to be any redemption there is so much work to be done, this title should actually release around 2017.\n\n\nEdit since release:\nGame now runs at 35-60 fps inconistantly, resolution scaling is obviously locked below 1080. There might be new bikes but they are DLC. Some new gear. Devolper asked that I re-review, so here it is. Game is still a hot mess, graphics are re-hashed and look terrible, physics feel unnatural, there is little to no innovation. So there you go "♥♥♥♥ on me and call it rain" and then ask for an award after minimal effort, I stand behind my original review, a piece of ♥♥♥♥ at 60fps is still a piece of ♥♥♥♥.","October 27, 2015","false","7.2"," 40 of 51 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","40","51","6","1"

This game's physics feel like they've been dumbed down for children the ages of 3-5.  Any connection to real-world physics is lost here, unfortunately.   This is a problem in previous titles but here it's gone into turbo mode.   I dare say that this game isn't as fun as the original ExciteBike stand-up arcade game.  At least there you had control and things made sense.  Then there's the speed of this game.  It's mind-numbingly slow movements combined with the way the physics make no sense leaves me feeling a bit sick after just a few minutes of playing.\n\nThe graphics options...there are none.   I mean NONE.  Not even a screen size resolution option.  Not even a Full Screen option.  It starts (and stays) in 'windowed mode' at what looks like 1280x720.  The only way to get Full Screen is to Maximize the game window in the Task Manager.    The quality of the graphics is absolutely unacceptable in this day and age.   It's probably one of the worst looking and worst playing motocross game i've ever played.\n\nWorth $24.00?  Absolutely not!  Real wotrh (using other Steam games and prices as a guide) - $4.\n\nUnless they're considering a full replacement of everything in this game,  don't buy it.\n\nThere is one thing positive, though... The power the clutch has at low speeds is just right.  If Reflex had that i'd be happy with that game.\n\n________________________________________________________\n_________________________________\n\nEDIT- Looking on the website i see a fraudulent claim!\n\nhttp://s29.postimg.org/hdes63d47/Capture.png\n\nThat is definitely NOT true!  Steam should pull this game from its website at least until the time Nordic either remove the lie from their website,  or until they actually comply with the above claim.

There are also serious rendering issues with the terrain giving an offset transparent "3D-ish" look that can be seen in many screenshots.\n\nAnd for performance, even on a decent i7 w/ 2GB 760 GTX and 8GB RAM it runs terribly.  Any of the outdoor maps with AI racers framerate is mostly in the 20's, sometimes dipping into the teens.  Other races in the Supercross stadiums tend to perform better (mostly in the 40's), but that's still much worse than this game should be running.\n\nOn the upside, the game seems to control pretty well and might be fun once these technical issues are resolved.\n\nI would definitely wait to see if they fix these issues or just abandon the game, though.

Sadly this game gets a massive thumbs down, not so much for the gameplay itself more for the way the new Rainbow studiosNordic games has handled this title as well as their development processes.\n\n1.This game came locked originally, allowing us to ride 4 tracks and 2 bikes (not including the 450), was then later hacked by members of the community which unlocked content which in turn forced Rainbow to release a slapdash update to release the content which was already there for us.\n\n2.The lack of content being added to this special exclusive PC version (which is now due for console, exclusive eh)\nTBH its pretty feeble how much is actually being released, 3 Alive nationals and 1 freeride.  (which were the crap tracks) the rate in which things are coming are very slow tbh. WARNING Rainbow announced that PC players would also have to pay for the JS7 Compound, all OEM bikes (except Suzuki) and new gear. When they stated on their official forums months prior to release that ALL alive content including the JS7 tracks would be free.\n\n3.They boasted HD Textures and improved graphics, sadly folks this is not the case. There is nothing more than a poor console poor here with some fuzzy filter over the image and what looks like some slight MSAA on some of the tracks.\n\n4.The game itself still seems off compared to previous titles, for me personally i've tried my damn near hardest to ride fluid and smooth like other MX games and Reflex but this is still too clunky and very rigid in comparison.Its ok to play for 10 mins here and there but thats about it im afraid. If you are looking at this game as a subsitute for Reflex then tbh i would probably look elsewhere.\n\n5. No deformation that you really noticed, especially physically.\n\nI could go on and on about this game and its flaws but sadly i think the thing that makes this game bad is probably the way the Developers have gone about their business. Asking fans for feedback on what we'd like to see in a game and for our ideas, to all blatantly be ignored and pushed aside to accomadate for thier own game. Also im not quite sure who they think their demographic are nowadays as they stated our testers think its the best.

I started the game up and I instantly was taken back to the memories of playing MX Vs. ATV Unleashed on the PC when I was younger.

Graphics wise, it's the worst graphically optimized video game I've ever played. The textures on the track will just randomly disappear, on the edge of every jump on supercross tracks, the edges will be flickering everytime you near one. Gameplay wise, there is entirelly too much focus on "preloading'. You basically have to preload every jump you hit unless you have a ton of speed. Entirelly unrealistic for a video game that is based off of a realistic idea. Also, why must every bike be named off of the game creators. You have the liscensing for the motocross gear, get the liscense for the bike manufactors. No one who plays this game wants to ride the "Nordic Games 450MX". There is nothing fun about that.

I have 2 copies of this game for Xbox and I have it on PC. It's almost the same as MX vs ATV Alive but the physics are worse. A lot of the gear and music in the game is exactly the same as Alive, the graphics look just like Alive, but the bikes handle terribly. when you first start the game it takes a very long time to unlock upgrades, tires, gear etc. the bikes slide out very easily until you unlock tires that hook up better. In the air the bikes handle like tanks, it's very difficult to move the bikes in the air. The physics are what make this game so bad, the bikes dont carry hardly any forward momentum when you hit jumps, they get a lot of air and then it's like somebody turned the gravity on and they fall almost straight down. Using the clutch is a must is corners and if tap the clutch repeatedly you go faster in the straits for some reason. Also, if you put your settings on manual transmission, you can keep you're bike in 5th gear all the way around the track and clutch boost like no other, it's incredibly unrealistic. As much as I dislike this game, I did enjoy racing pit bikes! The pit bikes are the only reason I even own the game on PC, they're very agressive, and they somehow clear all the jumps that you can clear on a 250. So if you're looking for a game that you'll play for a long time and captures that real racing feeling, this game isn't the one, but if you're looking for something that might be fun for a week, it might suit you.\n\n**Update Oct 30, 2015**\n\nGame is a little bit better. More features and tweaks have been added to the game that've made it a little more playable. Still not that great of a game, but it does look like they're starting to put more effort into it. It needs to be optimized though, I can play GTA V on max settings, but this game doesn't even have as good of graphics and even with the textures turned down and what not, it still plays like it's in slow motion. There currently aren't any brand name bikes to choose from, and none of the bikes in the game actually resemble any brand name bikes, but my face did light up when I saw that they added a graphics kit to the game that I actually have on my bike IRL.

Despite all the issues and shortcommings of reflex it had one of the most fluid control systems. Supercross is a fun addition, but really not what I was expecting.\n\nThis is a step back in so many ways. I'm a KB racer. And there are many issues I've run into using the keyboard.\n- All the reflex controls are not available on the KB - why can't I lean left and right?\n- All the menus are designed for a controller, as the UI is all for xbox controls.\n- I don't know if this is a KB issue...but the clutch...WTF? Half the time you use the clutch it blocks input until you start mashing keys.\n- The camera view is really terrible in 1st person when using the KB. Unplayable.\nReally enough with the awful console ports it's so frustrating!!!!!\n\nThe UI is nice, but ultimatley is designed for contollers and is also very buggy. I consistantly lose my cursor after about 3-4 races....not being able to click on things you lose your ability to use a lot of the functions in the UI\n\nOn to the actual game.\n- Graphics are all locked, can't really customized.\n- The scaling is terrible. Nail a triple it looks like you're jumping over a 10 story building. I thought we were past these days!\n- Lots of bugs - lots of games that fail to launch, lots of spawning without a bike, glitched starts.....stuff that I thought was left in reflex.\n- Preload system is a step back compared to reflex. Whips and scrubs are't fluid at all.\n- Game just feels really stiff, not realy as fluid as it should feel.\n- Game is too lax with full on casing jumps and running into tuffblocks.\n\nBut there is some good.\n+ The game does sound awesome.\n+ The clutch actually has a purpose\n+ The option for manual shitfing is a nice addition\n+ There are lots of gear and graphics to choose from which is nice.\n\nIn short:\nThis seems like another crappy console port to me right off the bat. Has some nice features, but is ultimately a step backwards and there are a lot of bugs that need to be fixed.\n\n***update***\n\nSupercross is a lot more playable in 1st person with a controller. Actually fun. 3rd person is complete garbage though and kills any fun to be had.\n\nOnline play seems to be a complete wliderzone at this point.\n\nThe last patch that has added Nationals has destroyed FPS. Used to run this game at 1080p 90 fps. Since the last patch FPS has droped to 50's - 30's. It's worse while broadcasting.

On the national tracks I average about 25 fps and around 40 fps on the supercross tracks (I have a GTX980 btw). While it is technically playable, it's not enjoyable at all. I have motion blur turned off and the graphics are still VERY BLURRY and the game gives me headaches after a while. Which brings me to my next point, not only are the graphics options lacking in my opinion, there's no in-game graphics option menu at all!!!\n\nEven assuming the optimization issues get fixed at some point, the game despite just being released a few months ago feels like a dated 5+ year old console port with mediocre graphics. It doesn't really offer anything new other than rhythm racing.\n\nThis has been by far the most disappointing game in recent years for me.

I KNOW IT"S ON PC BUT FOR THE LOVE OF GOD USE A CONTROLLER. Just trust me, the way the game's built it feels so much better that way.\n\nOkay now that that's been established... the actual gameplay.\n\nThe Reflex system IS in this game, but if the last game you played was Reflex, well, it handles a little differently, so be prepared. The rider control influences the bike a lot more in turns, you can easily accidentally 180-360 degree turn your bike if you aren't careful. Other than that, the responsiveness is a lot better and feels a lot more like your rider has weight. It does make the physics system a little wonky if you ignore the rider control though, as the bike feels a lot more like a slippery brick, Rainbow has done a wonderful job of weighting these systems together and the rider and bike feel separate and together at the same time (unlike Reflex where they often felt more separate than anything else).\n\nVehicle customization returns and changing off stock parts does change the performance of the bike/atv, although the fine tuning from Reflex is not there, (I'm very sad about this).\n\nThe AI still crashes into you, but it won't throw you off your ride. It actually drives like it isn't trying to commit a murder suicide constantly, although the AI doesn't compensate for slipperiness on the ATVs so be prepared to see more than one com flying at you from another track section. Other than that, it's no more easy or difficult, you just won't be forcibly wiped out by the AI every 10 secs if you get stuck in the group.\n\nYour Bike is also more sturdy now, or at least it feels more sturdy (I've been told it's slipperry though if you don't pull back on the rider to increase traction), and wiping out isn't quite as easy unless you throw the bike and rider hard in one direction or ram your front wheel into the ground when landing. The actual Reflex (QTE to stay on the bike from Reflex game) is gone making some landings that seem like they should throw you off strange when they would have thrown the QTE to recover in your face before, you now have to recover (or break your riders neck) with your own decisions, the bike will not auto-recover via magical Analog stick flick anymore.\n\nAnd finally we also see the return of the 50cc class. That's random but it's so fun.\n\nOverall Score:\n\nPros-\n- The Reflex system, after a minor adjustment period, feels a lot better\n- The core gameplay is still there, however it leans heavily on the reflex system rather than steering.\n- Bike customization affects performance to a degree\n- Your placement is still determined more by the lines you picked and your ability to control the bike than your ability to out run the AI with blind speed. In fact, blind speed will  lose the race a lot of the time, even on rookie.\n- There are 34 tracks. 17 Supercross, 12 National, and 5 Rhythm\n- You can wear a chicken mask as a helmet\n\nCons\n- The Gameplay is a bit more nuanced and weighted towards the rider than before. As such it feels very clunky if you ignore the rider controls.\n- Bike can feel slippery and underperforming to new players. This is fixed with parts which are unlocked during play easily.\n- Fine tuning is gone\n\nOverall 7.5/10 It's good.","May 13, 2015","true","30.2"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

But this time around the Reflex physics seem even worse, playing on my XBOX 360 Controller; the bike is never stable on woops or whenever you need to lean, and also it never seems to return to the upright position 100%, i tested this across 2 different controllers to rule out that as an issue.\n\n- Rythym Racing: Awesome concept, would have been the best aspect of the game for me except this stupid reflex engine ruins any sort of fast rythym you can get going.\n\n- Another Physics Issue: I kept this one seperate because it is another pain in the ♥♥♥ enitrely. When you clutch dump at the start of a down ramp on a jump you get this sudden, VERY UNREALISTIC burst of acceleration, same as when you holeshot off the line; which seems like you get a good start but then your speed is quickly wiped off. Most noticeable when you get a great start, you start off in 1st but are quickly overtaken by half the pack.\n\n- Performance: This game for me atleast runs like a bag of ♥♥♥♥. Random FPS Drops from a constant 60fps and it runs alot less fluidly then any other 60fps game i have, not much else to say here other then it plain sucks.\n\nPROS:\n- The graphics certainly seem alot more realistic, although there needs to be more room for finetuning individual details like AA, Texture Detail, Rider Detail etc.\n\n- The game COULD be fun if i wasn't so OCD on every aspect of it.\n\n- no shortage of content.\n\nCONCLUSION: As you can see from above there alot of CON's, heavily outweighing the PRO's. There is ALOT, and i really mean ALOT that needs fixing with this game, which leads to me wonder; WHY DID NORDIC TAKE THIS OUT OF EARLY ACCESS? i cannot fathom why a game with this many problems was ever released as a full game and not held back.\n\n4/10: Could have been alot better, but it seems like everything was "That'll do"","November 4, 2015","false","16.2"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","1"

Still cannot say I would suggest buying this, there were marginal framerate improvements, however, with a GTX 780 a significant portion of the game is still un playable, and the frame rates in the remaining bit are not what I would call enjoyable or acceptable, being that on an indoor supercross track I was lucky to hit 50, and probably averaged around 30 or 40, that is on an indoor track with minimal impact on your system.  Everything except the indoor supercross does not appear to be playable at the moment, at around a 23fps average for what I would say is still a high end video card, running on high with not anti aliasing at 1080p, which should definitely not be any issue for this system, as it maxes pretty much every other game I've found at 1080p just fine.\n\nTL;DR: Marginal frame rate improvements with latest update, very significant portion of the game is still not playable, and the portion that can be considered playable is not enjoyable.  Would not suggest buying the game.\n\nKeeping this note here: there is $116.99 worth of DLC, for a game that costs $29.99.

If you were more like me and only ever played the free-ride from the other games (30+ hours of it on reflex on steam and 50+ hours on disc version of reflex) then you might want to pick up Reflex, as I had much more fun with it. The only redeeming quality of the game for me was the different bikes (didn't touch the ATV's).

I'm still learning the tracks and what the bike can do but it feels at least as good as reflex to me.  I only have two real complaints, I can't find anywhere to turn rumble off on the controller or a way to turn in game chat off.  The in game chat I can ignore, but with a wireless controller having rumble on kills batteries too quickly.  It is different than reflex, being able to go fast on reflex doesn't automatically transfer to going fast on this one - which is a good thing.  Once you get used to the way the controls work the new tracks are a blast!\n\nUpdate:  80+ hours on this one now, and I'm liking it more the more I play.  Learning how the controls work and getting faster takes time...just like reflex did.  Most of the really fast guys have 200+ hours and I anticipate it taking me that long or longer to get really good.

There are several things that were done poorly or not at all. The thing that bugs me THE MOST about this game is the turning tf man, Tires do not glide across the air. The tracks are not well sized at all compared to the amount (or lack of) power the bikes have, even the best players of this game I am sure find themselves casing it on a regular basis. One thing I could live with but am still upset about is the fact there is no free riding map (yes you can be the only one on a track) but it is not good enough. The lack of tricks and how hard they are to do them is very frustrating, Wheeling is so hard to get up and so easy to stay up, whips are near impossible on anything smaller than a 250.

I really do thank Rainbow for finally fixing the performane issues, so now I shall write a fair review in return. I'm gonna try and keep it short as possible, but looks like there's lots of things to cover here. I'm not trying to bash on Rainbow or Nordic in any way, just reviewing the game in my honest and opinion.\n\nFirst off, the game itself is kinda fun, but doesn't really live up to what i was expecting. I was honestly hoping for a reflex2.0, but it turned out as a washed out Alive2.0.\n\nTo start here, the physics are honestly what i think are weighing down the rest of the game so much. I would have been fine if the same physics for reflex were used for supercross encore, because it really is the better of the motocross games out there. The new physics engine isn't terrible, but it feels like there was a step backwards from the right direction. The turning is like skating on brown ice simulator amped up a notch, and the whips are more like slightly maneuvering the bike sideways rather than flipping it which ever way you want like a sick pancake. scrubbing is alright but sometimes you'll end up turning sideways and transition into a super lame whip then proceed to land sideways because bringing back a whip is actually hard to do for some reason.\n\nBraking seems to be a problem too. i had a few times when i hit the brakes and spun into a 720 noscope as if i were playing mw2 quickscope battles on rust. i know i had the oversized brakes updgrade on but jeez dude i dont think they have that kind of power.\n\nAgain, unlike reflex this game has your rider as a living tank that holds on to the bike with an absolute death grip and will only wreck if you are completely flatlining or upside down when landing a jump. Same with getting smacked into by other riders, instead of both wrecking, it just goes into bumper cars mode. and for the most part the AI is still dumb as it has been for generations now. most the time you can win a race going half speed as long as the opponents keep crashing into one another.\n\nThis game also really abuses the use of the clutch and seatbouncing, it's over powered what you can do if you just pop the clutch(which would stall the bike) and then seatbounce off a triple, you'll end up quading into the next section from the super mega ultrasanic speed boost. also it'd be real sweet if there was a manual gear shifting option, because no full sized racing dirtbike i've ever seen is automatic.\n\n\nAND WHERE DID THE TRACK DEFORMATION GO?\nthat was one of  the coolest features for reflex, because you could carve out your out deep ruts and really rail it around berms with em, but in sx encore it seems like you cant even put an indention into the ground, sadly. Also... the rider reflex thing that you can use to save yourself from a crash is absent from this game, it's just an automatic animation. why would you do that?\nso yeah it's apparent now that i really liked reflex, and lots of other mx vs atv fans can agree it's the best one out there.\n\nNow that the biggest problem  is out of the way, i can get onto the little details and stuff i noticed were missing.\n\nOk, so the career mode isnt really much of a career, it's just racing after racing and getting some cool rewards, which is how it's been in pretty much all of the previous mx vs atv games. I'd like to see a career mode done differently, with sponsorships and all that fun stuff. You know another thing that's just completely missing from the supercross experience? where's all the qualifying, heats, semis, and lcq races? the race just starts off in the main event, which is really anticlimatic for me. Where's the 20 man gate drop too? i've been waiting around for that for years. This isnt much of a big deal, but it'd really add to the authenticity that makes this game "supercross".\n\nSountrack is good for the most part with some cool fitting music, but there were some songs i felt kinda killed the mood for me. BUT i did hear some of the old reflex songs and i was really excited to hear those again because they are amazing.\n\nThe customization is still nice with the variety of cool gears there are, but there's always gotta be more. Would be nice if there were even more added for free, or really really.... really cheap\n\nMost of the tracks out there are actually great and feel like a SX track. so that's one good thing going for the game if i may say. The addition of the MX tracks from alive is definitely great, and im sure glad it happened, so why not also add tracks from other games too? reflex, untamed, and unleashed all had some good stuff and i'd like to see em again. why not throw in some of the older gears too?\n\nalso please dont make expensive dlc.  like seriosuly nobody likes that. if a company were to sell me dlc, it better be worth every penny\n\n\nso im finally gonna wrap up this super long review. i didnt spend too much time organizing but i think i got my point across.best wishes to rainbow and nordic because i want to believe they can bring the series back to life. thanks to the developers again, but come on man you can surely do better, YOU JUST GOTTA BELIEVE!\n\nTLDR: game is fun, but it aint no reflex. i wanna recommend this game but i just cant do it.\n\n"it's ok"\n6/10","February 27","false","15.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","7"

I have owned every MX VS ATV game since the first release way back on PS2 as a testimate to my loyalty. As a rider myself and a motocross enthusiast I have to say that the physics are terrible. I wasn't expecting a one to one simulator but to me the physics engine needs a major overhaul.  The graphics are aweful and somewhat blurry looking. I do have what few graphics settings there are maxed out. Performance has not really been an issue for me. After the recent performance update I average about 80 FPS. The DLC model can go burn in H***.... $139.68 for all the DLC !!!! REALLY??????? Good God, NO THANKS NORDIC that is absurd. I would not recommend this game to my Worst Enemy. Also a word of advice to Nordic, take a look at Bohemia Interactive's business model and how they communicate with their gaming community. It is probably the best I have ever seen from a game developers stand point. I am still desperately craving the next great MX game. Every year the Motocross community gets larger and larger. Between Freestyle and Racing the Motocross fan base is larger, right now, than it has ever been in the history of the sport. Yes, there is a demand out there for a triple A motocross game.

The terrain deformation is worse than Reflex, the handling a slight improvement, less options as far as tracks, vehicles and game modes. The graphics are a slight improvement and sound about the same.\nThen the coup de gras, micro transactions on bikes and pay for track DLC and even if you buy all that you still have a game that is less than Reflex in most ways, with the "fun factor" being the biggest one.\nJust go buy Reflex and have fun.","January 11","false","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Online it works great from what I've seen.\n\nThe xbox 360 version is fun but the pc version is better in every way other than it lacks a big community. Nordic just needs to throw an American tournament (for PC) like what they did in Europe, where 1st place takes home a new bike.\n\nI wish xbox 360 supercross ran as smooth and fast as the pc version does online. The PC version RULES, get xbox360 in that kind of shape and it will be a true gem.\n\nKeep up the great work! This game has LOTS of potential and the devs know it.

I wanted to get it out of the way since if you want the real thing you have to go do the real thing, just sayin. This is a great game. in the first person view. Any other view stinks but first person ROCKS. I am running a pretty beastly machine but it handles it fine on the console it was choppy and felt behind my controls at times, not on the PC fast as lightning throwing massive whips albeit over Malcom Stewarts head, (yeah right he stinks) but anyhow it controls with a logitech f510 like a dream. None of those elitist idiots from mx simulator so far either buncha jerks. No this one rocks and is great but remember it is just a game so to compare it to real life is like comparing fact to fiction. I love star wars but have yet to see Darth Vader in the flesh however I am not expecting too either. I love the game here is a hint for you if you want to keep up with me......clutch clutch clutch especially on the 250's but even on the 450 which in real life would get you killed, however a timed perfect clutch fan does more than suspension preload ever does in the game. In the game I said. Now go get it and throw some whips over Malcoms head god knows he aint winning a 450 race for real.

It's not a game for real racers young or old.  If I had an 8 year old child I'd let him or her play it, but I'm sure they'd think it was just too funny and fake as well.

Just like Reflex, you need to use both sticks to control your rider to completetion and I personally don't like it that much. It seems this game is more mechanics heavy over being just fun. It's much harder to fall off your vehicle though and it just feels so unrealistic as much as other parts of this game feel realistic. The AI isn't too smart and just lands everywhere, even ontop of you (you still don't bail). The game has no graphics options and even on an impressive PC it lags at some points. Speaking of graphics, they look great, but at this point the textures don't really "pop", but fade in the closer you get. I'm sad there isn't any outside tracks, and some tracks seem somewhat similar. A decent amount is there, but I really would like outside tracks. Customization is pretty good and vehicles have their own performance stats. You have to unlock quite a bit to play more or dress up with different outfits.\n\nGood game overall, but maybe wait until it's more stable...","March 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Yes i know the old MX ATV titles had a supercross mode, but I was looking for a SX specific game. Yes the controls feel a bit weird and the bikes are slow at first. The physics are off and so far I havent managed falling off the bike yet even though some of the situations would have been catastrophic had the proper physics been in play. But for me at this very moment, could care less. In the future I am sure there will be more graphics options, better physics put into play and just more stuff. This game isn't scheduled to be released until Q4 of the gaming year. Look at this as a BETA and know that the end product will be different than this. If you like Reflex, I'm sure you still have Reflex. Test this game, report to Nordic, and enjoy.\n\nIf you want a more refined MX game, go purchase MXGP. It's on sale. If you want to finally play another MX ATV game since it has been forever since the PC has seen one, get this game. If you buy an Early Access game, lower your starting standards. $20 isn't much money to test a game for 3-6 months. If it is a lot of money to you, then I suggest waiting for future releases.","March 7, 2015","true","8.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

There, I said it.\n\nThere are two major things about this game that annoy me.\n\nThe first is obvious; the framerate issues. From the poor console port of Reflex from 7 years ago, until now, these games have had poor framerate issues (and graphical issues on Reflex for some cards including mine). Whenever you're by yourself on a supercross track, the framerate is almost always above 60fps on newer hardware. Anywhere else (nationals, free ride, rhythm racing), it drops considerably. The developers have said that this is due to the trees, and the lag everywhere else is due to the dirt physics and terrain deformation. I kinda halfway believe that this is the case, but whatever.\n\nThe second is the clutch kick. It is WAY too strong. Yes, it gets you out of terrible situations whenever you don't hit a rhythm perfectly, but in no way should it be that strong, especially on hard packed dirt. Once they tone that down a bit, I'd say this game is pretty spot on with its physics.\n\nAlso, the track scaling is pretty big compared to real life like it has been for previous games (except Alive, which was rebranded to this. The smaller tracks in Alive had perfect scaling IMO), but I remember seeing an interview where a developer explained that this is because they want the game to have the pick-up-and-play aspect and that the game isn't too hard. Eh, I can live with that.\n\nIf the problems can be fixed in a timely manner, this game gets a solid 8.5/10 from me. If not, it's staying at a 6/10. I can still recommend this game based on its potential and current playability.","January 31","true","31.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

There, I said it.\n\nThere are two major things about this game that annoy me.\n\nThe first is obvious; the framerate issues. From the poor console port of Reflex from 7 years ago, until now, these games have had poor framerate issues (and graphical issues on Reflex for some cards including mine). Whenever you're by yourself on a supercross track, the framerate is almost always above 60fps on newer hardware. Anywhere else (nationals, free ride, rhythm racing), it drops considerably. The developers have said that this is due to the trees, and the lag everywhere else is due to the dirt physics and terrain deformation. I kinda halfway believe that this is the case, but whatever.\n\nThe second is the clutch kick. It is WAY too strong. Yes, it gets you out of terrible situations whenever you don't hit a rhythm perfectly, but in no way should it be that strong, especially on hard packed dirt. Once they tone that down a bit, I'd say this game is pretty spot on with its physics.\n\nAlso, the track scaling is pretty big compared to real life like it has been for previous games (except Alive, which was rebranded to this. The smaller tracks in Alive had perfect scaling IMO), but I remember seeing an interview where a developer explained that this is because they want the game to have the pick-up-and-play aspect and that the game isn't too hard. Eh, I can live with that.\n\nIf the problems can be fixed in a timely manner, this game gets a solid 8.5/10 from me. If not, it's staying at a 6/10. I can still recommend this game based on its potential and current playability.","January 31","true","31.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

And I really liked Reflex.\nI even bought this game on Xbox because I wanted to play it and it got delayed.\nSo.... I initially thought they need more time to release it in a playable version.\nSoooooo what do you get when you buy the game now(8th of March 2015)?\n\nIt in fact is a version of the game that is ported from console using the same "program" that was used for Reflex. You have to start a exernal program to change the settings, if you can call it that. the only thing you can do in the graphics menu is change the resolution and toggle fullscreen, Thats it.\nOk could still be not that bad considering that Reflex was playable on PC after Nordic did the last patch.\nWRONG! I really hate hating the game for this since it is still early-access but they really had enough time.\n\n\nWHAT IS/COULD BE RIGHT WITH THIS GAME:\n\n- It didn't stutter/lag, at least not in the breaks between game-crashes (i7 4790k, HD7970)\n- It felt kinda like the console version\n\nWHAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME:\n\n-There is no career mode\n-The bikes have different stats than in the console version\n-You can only play the first 4 tracks because you have to play career to unlock more\n-The graphics are WORSE than the console version\n-I don't really know anything else because it crashed 2 times within 30min(don't ask me why Steam thinks I only played it 5min idk) and I really don't want to play it again before the next patch\n\n\nDo I like this game?\n\nMAYBE.

I will wait to see what this new content update brings. I understand that this is an early release but cmon devs', make this a good game.\nEDIT: I'm not saying MXGP is perfect either, but if MX vs ATV could adopt the handling that MXGP has, it would become a very good game.","April 2, 2015","false","2.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The graphics are pretty nice but not the best. The music is alright, certainly needs more though. The physics are awkward, and need serious tuning but it is doable, better than Alive on consoles. The framerate however is awful outside of free roam especially on the new nationals tracks, most likely due to lack of optimization that i'm sure will come soon.

If something doesn't feel right you can give feedback and most likely the forum of ill repute will agree with you.  I love love love love loved the last MX / ATV -- complete with the crazy trucks and tracks throught he mud and woods and craziness.  I'm not all that much for the inside tracks.  I can move the rider as I need to, the sluggishness mentioned below is because they weren't using the other stick (which controls the pitch of the rider) so you can lean into corners, lean forward in to corners, lean backward in to corners (why?! - cause you can) and it's very responsive.  Something else you'll note (and I loved this about the last game too) is the tracks you make are not just graphic decals.  They're actual impressions in the surface of the track, you can (and will) get bumped by them, get unintended air, and be thrown off by them or even led on rails through them if you hit them right.  I think this is genious and should be a part of any racing game - car or otherwise that has anything remotely to do with DiRT.\n\nIt's a solid $25 -- I want to see less supercross, more outdoors cross... forget what the menu said... and here I end with dumb.","July 29, 2015","true","4.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","3"

TBH even in rookie I am not as good as I was in Reflex, it would be good to have some tutorials and or ideal line and throttle so that I can get the power and speed right for the jumps and not lose as much.\n\nIf you’re a fan of MX vs ATV, the EA worth it.

The traditional : W,S,A,D  work for direction and braking but thats about it.. This works fine in carreer mode, but when racing online against someone who has a controller and clutch with gear controll , you get destroyed at the start gate  as they can keep their revs up with clutch in and then just launch  away in 2nd gear and you can kiss the race good bye!  just like real life!  Hopefuly this gets fixed in a future patch..  Also hope you can use something  different than xbox 360 controller!  Microsoft should not have a monopoly on this game.. Its kind of like EA developers having the brilliance to only allow 3 wireless routers to function properly in BF3..  Anyway please dont allow  "partial controller support" to be xbox 360 controller  only !! after game is completed.. I still cant use my saitek controller on MX vs. ATV reflex but it works perfectly in MX GP , please dont let this be the case for ENCORE, this game is to damn fun!","July 22, 2015","true","243.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

IMO mxgp is better, but is more of a sim, while this is more arcade. I'll update this after playing more in the future when Im not as busy.

(like in real life!)\n2.JUMP OFF THE STARTING LINE - Remove it from the game, he has enough boost using the clutch, why did you put such an UNREALISTIC start to the riders right when the gate drops?, it is like the rider is in a sling shot! Totally unrealistic!\n3.TUFF BLOCKS OBJECT COLLISION - Modify this code, When you hit a TUFF BLOCK the rider just stops, like he has hit an invisible wall and he just stays straight, no angular collision movement and totally unrealistic consequences to running into this object, Reflex was way more believable!\n4.CONTROLLER SETTINGS, FORCE FEEDBACK IS NOT AN OPTION - Fix it, give us the option to turn off game pad force feedback.\n5.PHYSICS - THE WHIP - This is the biggest gripe I have about the game, put the REFLEX whip back into this game and you will have a major hit on your hands! The whip in this game is very dumb feeling and totally goes backwards in the evolution of this franchise.\n\nThose are the MUST FIX for me, there are more but that would fix your game and would show respect to your future Target Market Fans.\n\nLIKE:\n1.CLUTCH action - Awesome!, at least it works and is more apparent than the reflex clutch which really does not work very well.\n2.TRACKS - Awesome!\n3.TEXTURES - Awesome! Visually, you guys really improved on this, I build tracks for reflex and I can really respect the advance in the texture quality, very real looking!\n4.OBJECTS - Awesome! Visually very real looking!\n5.GRAPHICS - Awesome! Game plays and looks great!","March 11, 2015","false","56.8"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

All I can say is that the developers need to make this game free to play because it is not worth $24.99. I would not recommend this game to anyone with any PC build below high end ($1000+) I have a $900 PC, 0.9 hours was about all i could take of this to be honest. So should you decide to buy this game, just know this:\n\n- Keyboard and mouse controls are impossible, you WILL need a controller.\n- OK Graphics and effects, they try to hide a lot of the texture and effect flaws with motion blur.\n- Crappy animations.\n- VERY bad optimization.\n- Chase camera is very weird at times.\n- A few noticeable bugs here and there.\n- Most graphics are locked so good luck with that.\n- Physics are buggy.\n- Scale on most objects are off, or so it seems to me.\n\nOverall, this is a step back from Reflex; and yes, before you go and comment that, "Its only early access!!" I understand that, but its been two months since its own release and it's still one of the buggiest and laziest executed Early Access games that I've ever seen. If you're planning on buying this, I would hold off until the developers fix everything and it starts getting more positive reviews.","May 21, 2015","false","0.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Framerate issues, my computer has a fx8350 and a gtx 660ti, the game stutters and have fps drops everywhere, the graphics are not as shown in screenshots, they are worst, there´s a weird phantom terrain and Ao is grainy as ♥♥♥♥, you can literally see the dots.\n\n2.physics are suppossed to be easyer to newbies and casual gamers, the new physics are reworked from alive, the clutch gives you a super boost forward, no matter how much times you press it, the preload gives you a thruster effect, you are catapulted upwards, both are pretty inconsistent, so the lines in a track are almost never the same ones, no matter how much you try.\n\n3-crashes, god, you can land a 60mt triple or quad short with the front wheel and ride away! :O\n\nI really hope they fix this, i bought this game hoping the best, now i can tell is crap :(","April 13, 2015","false","4.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

I remember watching a video of a dev talking about how they were using the reflex engine, yet here we are with an alive clone that plays like a crap mx game you'd download for free on your iphone.\n\nI really want this game to go somewhere and not waste my 20 bucks, so I'll list things I find to be poorly done.\n\n-So far I've played 3 races, after that I can't play more than 2-3 laps without the game shutting off. no crash message, nothing. Just ♥♥♥♥♥ off and goes to desktop.\n\n-The AI is inconsistant as hell, theres times I'll easily put 5-10 seconds on the AI, then they randomly come out of nowhere and pass me, when I didn't make a mistake.\n\n-The controls are sluggish feeling, it feels like something out of a game I played long ago, Big motha truckers. I don't want to feel like I'm driving a semi when I'm playing an MX game.\n\n-When you jump, it feels like you slow down and just fall out of the air, that isn't how it works, and isn't how it should look/feel.\n\n-Preloading feels more like a forward boost, using it in the woops section effectively turns you into a superhero. If you fix the problem stated previously of slowing down and falling out of the air, you wouldn't need the forward boost to make the jumps in a preload, just the upward boost.\n\n-The wheelies make me sad. If you don't know what I mean, go into the game and try a wheelie.\n\n-The WAIT. I was really expecting something good with how much the game was hyped up for a while, especially now that it's been delayed so much. If you want people to remain interested, you have to keep them up to date, at least a little information every few weeks would be cool. You can't expect people to be happy when you make them wait this long, and give them next to no information so there is no feedback from the fans until you are just about ready to launch the game.\n\n","March 10, 2015","false","2.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

It could use more but it's definately playable now.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nMX vs. ATV is back. The question is, is it good?\nThe answer is, kind of.\n\nMvA Supercross Encore (long enough title?) Is an updated version of 2014's Mva Supercross originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3. The game features updated visuals, rider gear, bikes, Nationals tracks from MvA Alive, and a new event called Rhythm Racing. The game also retains the tracks from the 2014 Supercross release. The handling of the bikes was very clearly overhauled since the release of the early access version, and you can actually whip bikes around quite a bit now. Leaning into turns was drastically changed, you're able to slide around a lot more than you could before. The tracks look nice and are fun to play. Now, why is this game 'kind of' good?\n\nThe optimization is downright horrible. Really. On a GTX 680 and a Core i7, you'd think I could run this game no problem, that is NOT the case. Most tracks run at around 40-50 FPS, often dropping into the low 20s. I just can't get my head around why the optimization is so bad. Reflex had very good optimization and ran like a dream. This game, is sluggish at best, unfortunately. It really is a shame, as the new physics are actually pretty fun to play with.\nHonestly, with the optimization how bad it is right now, I simply cannot reccomend this game. Yes, the tracks are fun and flow well. Yes, the new features are really nice. But the optimization is really dragging it down and I hope it gets improved within reasonable time.","October 27, 2015","true","25.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","7"
