"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/recommended/345080/","PeteOzzy","PeteOzzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PeteOzzy/","4901 products in account","Flame Over’s title is more than just one in a long line of fire-related jokes you’ll spot playing through Laughing Jackal’s action pyrogue-like. It’s a searing reference to a screen you’ll be viewing an awfully often as you try to battle the blaze in several distinct locations. I think we’re all familiar by now with the genre’s thirst for the souls of dejected and frustrated gamers, breaking their spirits twice as often as raising them. Flame Over surpasses those sadistic expectations and almost rivals Spelunky in terms of unforgiving mechanics and an unrelenting demand that you adapt or die. Fortunately for me, a rather averagely skilled gamer, there’s a short period of burning rage for the game before you endure a baptism of fire, emerging with full understanding of the gameplay and a love for its malicious streak.\n\nYour aim in Flame Over is three-fold. There’s the obvious out-of-control blaze that needs to be addressed and doing so unlocks the next floor of the building. There’s also a time limit hanging over your head, counting down until almost certain doom at the hands of the omnipresent Grim Reaper that pursues you eternally. This leads on to your next concern; rescuing the hapless civilians grants an extra minute in which to complete the level objectives. It’s much more than a bonus though, as time is extremely tight and you won’t get far without saving a couple of survivors per level. Of course, the third and final duty is not dying. It may sound patronising, but anyone playing this game will know that the hardest thing to accomplish is simply living long enough to achieve any of the above goals. Standing too close to fire for long periods and backdrafts from unsprayed doors can cost you one of your limited hearts, though rescuing cats can replenish them.\n\nEach room you enter will be in a varying state of emergency, with burning furniture spitting volatile projectiles at other objects in order to spread the blaze. Luckily, you have two weapons to tackle the flames; a water hose for the more traditional fires and an extinguisher to smother electrical fires. Both of these have tanks which need replenishing from various points throughout levels but the limits are fairly generous so it’s generally a secondary concern. There are further gadgets to be discovered, with shops popping up randomly Spelunky-style in levels offering costly but hugely beneficial upgrades for that life alone. Coins can also be saved to unlock permanent perks with varying effects, the rate of collection is surprisingly charitable and you’ll see some steady progress with successful runs.\n\nThe physics of the flames, water and fire-retardant foam is pretty impressive, reminding me oddly of Luigi’s Mansion or Super Mario Sunshine. Fireballs bounce across rooms, leaving destructive trails that birth new hazards but you feel impressively powerful as you hose down entire rooms rather quickly once you discover the most efficient techniques. It looks pretty great too, with the overwhelming glow and billowing smoke making it one of the prettier roguelikes. It might not impress those that like to study screenshots for minute signs of downgrades but they perform excellently at providing a unique style.\n\nThat difficulty level I mentioned earlier will be a sticking point for many, but a veritable paradise to others. I have to admit that I struggled to enjoy the Flame Over in the very beginning; I can’t quite place if I failed to pay attention during the tutorial or if it could do with a slight expansion but with hindsight, I can see quite clearly that I was playing “wrong”. The electrical fires were overwhelming, even with the appropriate tool but once you make your first priority finding the circuit breaker and shutting the power down, they’re very simply doused. There’s an FAQ compendium waiting to be written by the more passionate players and I’d highly recommend reading one after three or four miserable failures. With a high bar to succeed, if you don’t quite hit it the first few times then I can understand why you’d feel frustrated but it’s ridiculously compelling and it doesn’t take long for that magical click.\n\nIt’s refreshing to see someone take a distinctly dungeon-crawling genre and apply the mechanics to something quite different. The dark, grimy depths are replaced with well-lit offices and laboratories while the mobs are supplanted by a relentless inferno acting on a powerful hive mind. After a short while, it feels like a typical roguelike, with searching furniture for hidden bonuses becoming reminiscent of looting chest but it’s remarkable how an aesthetic change can play a major part in refreshing a rather traditional experience.\n\nDifficulty aside, there were moments of contention that are slightly less down to personal taste. The controls are functional on mouse and keyboard and I certainly wouldn’t say that they’re at all remotely poor but playing on a controller was revelatory. Regardless of your preferred input choice though, the camera occasionally makes fire-fighting more cumbersome than it could have been. The sheer number of view-obscuring walls in the levels makes spotting fires hidden in corners difficult at times, and with the time limits being on the stingy side, it’s seconds cost you can scarcely afford. You soon become adept to manipulating the camera at all times, but without a controller, that becomes a difficult task.\n\nIf you take the time to work out why you’re failing but then the struggle quickly ends and it’s replaced by a wonderfully intense action experience with some of the most addictive and creative mechanics I’ve experienced. Much like an actual fire, the need to keep a calm balance in the face of panic is a necessity but when things go wrong, and they always will in Flame Over, the adrenaline that kicks in is a heady rush. This is one roguelike that I won’t hesitate to recommend, a bright spark in the darkness of a genre that very rarely steps out of its comfort zone.\n\n*This game was reviewed using a key provided by the developer.

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Flame Over is a rogue-like (lite) fire-fighting themed game developed by Laughing Jackal and published by Ghostlight ltd. The game was originally released on the Playstation Vita and subsequently on the PC.\n\nThe story is pretty straight forward.  The player takes control of Blaze Carruthers, a firefighter tasked with putting out a building fire that is engulfing 'Inferno Industries'.  Go through the multiple levels of the building putting out fires, rescuing the staff, their pet cats, and a particularly stubborn quest giver by the name of 'Miss Ion'.\n\nPROS:+ Good art style and graphics.\n+ Good sound design and sound track.\n+ Very good game mechanic such as: Extinguisher deals with Electrical fire or turning off the building's electricity etc.\n+  Refreshing new theme for the rogue-like genre.\n+ Upgrade system that carries over for every playthrough, but be warned, items bought from the NPC store does not.\n+ Mini-missions that rewards you with gold and unlock tokens for the upgrades mentioned above\n+ Challenging late game levels.\n+ Good time limit mechanic that lets you keep playing at 00:00 for so long as you outrun death who will be chasing you around.\n+ Replayability\n\nCONS:- Some players (including me), have experienced our progress being wiped if you exit the game without dying.  This includes your statistics and upgrades.\n- Some game mechanics were not discussed in the tutorial (such as green flame and chemical spills).\n- Some items have no description which means you'll have no idea what they do.\n- Game is relatively short.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGOOD GAME and is a fun casual experience if you're looking for a fun game to play during your down time.\n\nI can RECOMMEND this game at full price which is $11.99 or your regional equivalent IF you're into the rogue-like genre and IF you're particularly interested in its fire-fighting theme.  Other than that, a SALE would be preferable.\n\nI personally enjoy playing this game during my internet downtimes or during short breaks in between work.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The floors are randomly generated, making every run unique. Each run through the game gets you coins and possibly upgrade tokens, which allow you to buy improvements making the next run a bit easier. Sometimes a level also contains a store allowing you to buy items that will help you along the way,\n\nEquiped with both a water tank and an extinguisher, you have to carefully manage your resources as you are fighting the fire. Water will work on all fires, but if you don't also extinguish electrical fires, they will flare up again.\n\nThe game has both a time and a health system. If either runs out, you will die. The timer or health don't reset between levels. By rescuing people and cats you gain extra time and health. On top of that, you might receive a mission from one of the survivors. completing these mission will earn you upgrade tokens.\n\nSadly the upgrade system is somewhat pointless, since  a lot of the upgrades apply to items you can buy when you come across a store. These store are so rare however, and the items you can buy are randomized, so most of the time you won't have access to the items you upgrades with your tokens. It makes the upgrade mechanic mostly pointless.\n\nI had great fun with the game at the beginning. There is a tutorial level and 4 more  area's, each compromised out of several floors. The first two areas are great, but once you hit the lab area, the difficulty ramps up in such a wa that progression is hardly possible. After dozens of tries, I have yet to clear a single floor in the Lab area. The game went from pretty fun to incredibly frustrating.\n\nIn the end I wouldn't recommend it. Without a better upgrade system and a better scaled difficilty system, the game feels lacking","June 12, 2015","false","7.1"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/345080/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","I am the lord of hellfire, and I bring you...\nThe roguelite genre is becoming a rather busy place as of late, with all sorts of entries satisfying the various niches and cravings that a fan could possibly desire. This one however is a rather unique and notable entry because the foe isn't something that you'd come to expect, namely - fire. Sure, fire might be an incidental or environmental hazard, but it's not every day you're going to be donning the uniform, putting on a nice shiny helmet and getting your hose out. (Make of that what you will). Here you play a rather cartoony firefighter, based in good ol' London, tooled up with bottles of foam, an axe and water, and it's his job to go charging in to various toasty environments and make things not so burny.\n\nFast paced, almost unforgivably hot in places, but almost adorable.\nThe civillians (Which remind me of the Xbox avatars) and cats you must rescue equate to precious extra minutes and lives, and time here is given out at a rate which means you have to keep moving fast, fast, fast. There's no time to dawdle and take in the scenery, it's a case of zoom in to the room, clear out the worst of the fire in the most efficient manner possible (without taking too much fire damage), use foam to clear out any electrical fires. And on to the next room, if you need to rescue anyone, you time it so you can get them back as you need to refill your water and foam supplies. This is a game that really punishes you for sticking around, as the moment you run out of time, the grim reaper may elect to show up, and if he catches you, that's an instant game over.\n\nThis brings me onto the difficulty overall. This game is harsh, as in - "Do the tutorials a few times, then repeat the first few levels until you've got the hang of it" harsh. Because the fire has been programmed in such a way that it will spread if areas that are burning are left untended, and will spit out fireballs that can catch on areas and start up new fires once more, it's very easy to not douse a room properly and before you know it, a room that's "Mostly done" becomes a room full of fire, and you'll lose 20-30 sec having to re-do your work. It pays to be thorough in each room, but without sacrificing too many of those precious seconds.\n\nThose poor hearts, the game snacks on them...\nYou're given three hearts (lives) as a means of recovering from mess ups, either from taking too much fire damage, or opening a door that's on fire, or similar misdemeanors. It's very easy to use up a heart simply by straying into areas which are too hot for too long and then having the fire pop up behind you, turning a safe area dangerous, educational in a sense in showing that fire is unpredictable and a roaring blaze needs to be treated with respect, but in game terms, it means you'll be losing lives almost as often as you'll gain them at times. The only thing that keeps you from running out of lives by say, floor 4 are the cats you save, which keep you alive and ticking over.\n\nThe long game..\nThankfully the game does get easier with repetition, cash can be poured into firefighter upgrades which improve drop chance, lengthen rescue revive times, and generally improve the overall hardiness of your firefighter. The roguelite metagame means that in the long term once you've picked up some equipment from one of the shops as you play, and once you've some upgrades in the bank, things smooth off and you'll be making steady progress, getting further and further.\n\nThe view from above...\nThe graphics are consistent and cartoony, and well presented, everything is easy to see and on a pad at least, controls are quick and easy to manage, this is important because quick reactions are fairly vital to not losing your lives in a hurry. The music is equally cheery, though how long before you reach for the "mute" button on it will be a matter of taste, the sound effects are well into the "functional" category, they work, that's it. Not much more to say. What I will give credit for is that the fire spreads and gives a glorious bright display when you open a new room, it can be quite livid and hateful when it wants to be, it's not some horrible bitmap, it feels like proper, angry fire.\n\nThe firetiger's opinion...\nIt ticks the roguelite boxes, with proc-gen levels, with a persistent upgrade tree, with equipment that makes life easier that you can get during the course of your run, and the game is pretty fun. It's very competent, and the theme helps make it stand out from what is now becoming a very crowded genre. It's not quite among the greats, but as they'd say t'up norf : "It'll do."\n\nVerdict : Recommended","May 28, 2015","true","2.1"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","26","39","3","4"

(not even available on mobile) It also looks a bit better when you're actually playing it.\n\nIf the premise looks interesting to you and you played a certain SNES fire game and always wanted something more this might fit the bill. It offers a lot of challenge and variety and the fact that the levels are randomly generated add a lot of replayability to this game. The game basically plays like it looks. You have a fire hose and extinguisher. Hose for normal fires and keeping the fire from spreading and the extinguisher for electrical/chemical fires. There's also items like water bombs and you have to rescue people, cats and a stuck up lady that won't leave unless you find her purse, kill alien specimens, clear out a bank vault, etc. This is a very arcade-like game and you only have a couple minutes to finish a level, with an extra minute added per rescue. People and cats die fast and fires spread fast so it's rather chaotic and stressful at times but you can upgrade as you go along to help bring the difficulty down at times.\n\nIt's dastardly difficult and very unforgiving at times but it's definitely skill based and not hard for the sake of being hard. This game surprised me and is well worth the purchase at any price, let alone sale.","November 2, 2015","true","4.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

(floor 1, one red bag, 3 5 files and post it in the red post box, 5 find the valult and loot it. however once compleated, you get a min and a half of time then and there, and she dropes a ion token, collect them so you can unlock more perks\n\nthe game has around 7-8 perks, aside from the first one, you need a set number of ion tokens to unlock them, then you can spend some  of your money to upgrade them up to 4 or so times, most of these really help you out in small simple ways. but. they really dont add that much to the game out side of giving you a reason to do the miss ion quests. if I had to say there was any bad points to the game, its that the missions are trivial and annoying, as all your doing is moving around near objects and pressing f. but at least its not interfearing with the game play at all and can be done fast. I am sure some people like it more then others. its never needed, but it can help.\n\nthe games difficulty goes up each stage set by not only getting slightly larger, but also expanding the size of the fires in each room. every 4 levels changes the theme (1-4 is office, 5-8 is ex rooms, 9-12 is the lab, 13-16 is the factory) each zone adds more flamable material, thigns which spread fire in more dangrous ways, as well as the 3-4 zone adding extra hazzerds. this makes it very hard to beat all of the levels, however you will be able to start at any stage if you want. once you have gotten to it once.\n\nthe soundtrack is for the most part really good, though each zone has only one soundtrack, when you get low on time, it changes to the panic form and stays there until you at least get one min of time on the clock. the theme of this game is amazingly fun, being very uk. I do find the audio to be very good with the exception of the looping on the spray for both foam and water. it tends to have weird pauses instead of being continuis fully, however these can be fixed. for a indy game its pretty well done though it has bugs.\n\nthe only downside is that there could be more room types. and the difficulty goes down alot on the early areas with pratice. to the point of sometimes feeling trival. and often most rooms are not that hard. however, there will always be that one room which is a jerk to you. and I do think that a bit more work could be put in to make the map generator a bit more consistant.\n\nthe developer is active on the forums, there was a day one patch which did make the game better, and its clearly a soild product. i can recommend this game to people who want somethign that works, and plays well. as always check the forum and do your reserch, watch a video or two to get a good idea about how it plays and if you will like it or not.\n\nI give this game a b+, very solid, while still having room to improve.","May 31, 2015","true","6.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Watch fires spread according to the materials available, attacking your fire fighter and generating dangerous hazards across 4 game zones."\n\nThe game was developed by Laughing Jackal and Published by Ghostlight. The game will release on the 28th May 2015. The cost of the game is $11.99/£8.99. The game will also release in the future for PS4 and is already out on the PS Vita. There are a total of 36 Steam achievements.\n\nIn the game you control a fire-fighter, or better known by his name "Blaze". With Blaze you must go around buildings which are randomly generated each time putting out the fires, saving humans and of course cats. Certain fires require certain types of extinguisher, Water gets rid of general fire and stops it spreading however for electrical fires you can only stop with foam. It is well worth noting that you have certain time in which to do each level and when the timer hits zero Death (A grim reaper) will chase you and if he catches you means it is game over. To counter this, each human save adds one minute to the timer.\n\nYou also have health points in the game, you start each level with a certain amount of hearts. You lose health points by being close to a fire which will increase the fire intensity (Pointed to you in a red bar in the middle of the screen around your character). If this is full you will lose a health point. The fires also shoot fireballs which you have to extinguish. Once you run out of health, this means game over.\n\nWhen extinguishing fires, saving people and cats you get money. You can use this money on skills such as getting discounts on them, being able to hold more water and more time. This is fun as they assist quite a bit.\n\nI started in the game using a controller. The controls were well laid out and I didn't find it too hard to gain mastery over the placement of the buttons. Likewise with the Keyboard, a WASD movement combined with left click for water and right click for foam. F button was interact and Z was for talking to people. It's worth noting however that you can change the button schemes in the main menu which means you have a lot of flexibility with them. The characters movements are easy to control and you won't have no difficulty navigating around.\n\nWhen you start each level it begins with a very smooth and fun cut scene. Out of all my time playing the game, I have never completed a mission. Embarrassingly enough it's because of my skill level. so I cannot say if the story goes deeper or if there are special cut scenes for completing missions.\n\nThe graphics of the game are very peculiar, The are cartoonish and colourful. Almost like Blazes moustache. All the graphics were solid though, there were no glitches or any bad side effects from much action. They all worked like they should have.\n\n\nThe music was composed especially for the game by Rimsky Music in Barcelona. The main song of the track seems to be everywhere and loops over and over. I do like it though but after a while had to turn it off.  All the other sound effects like the fire burning and the people talking were fine and added well to the whole experience.\n\nI personally would've preferred if there were difficulty settings as the game for me is really difficult. I do enjoy the challenge but would've loved to been able to spend longer on the levels without the fear of Death grabbing me. Other than that, I really did enjoy the game and the whole fire fighting experience as a whole. This is definitely for the more die hard gamers who enjoy a tough challenge. If you're looking for an easy task then fire fighting is definitely not easy!\n\nThe bottom line is that I would recommend this game, it's fun, challenging and very rewarding!\n\nEdit: I did learn how to play the game better and got real far, which was a real fun experience for me. Unfortunately, I got too far ahead of myself and started rushing. Once I opened the door which I forgot to extinguish first, I ended up inevitably dying from back draft. :)\n","May 28, 2015","true","3.1"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","16","24","3","0"

It’s one of the most common career ambitions among children around the world. And why wouldn’t it be? You get to save lives, be a hero and of course the chicks always dig the man in the uniform. It’s not until a little later in life that we realize that the goal isn’t as realistic as what we would have hoped. Our dreams dashed because it’s either too difficult to become a firefighter or the reality that you’d be putting your own life in danger too regularly scared the living daylights out of you and you reassessed your position. But now there is a way that you can live out your childhood dreams and be a firefighter. You’re still putting your lives on the line but this time its the virtual lives of the character that you play. That’s with Flame Over one of Laughing Jackal’s games on Steam and our first of three of their games over the next three days.\n\nAt it’s heart Flame Out is a top down shooter that has been designed in the form of a fire fighting game. The levels almost play out as puzzles whereby you need to determine whether you need to hose certain areas with water or extinguish them with foam. The game plays out as a real fire would for example foam is the only thing that will put out electrical fires. The game isn’t easy but it’s an enjoyable challenge that will have you learning its systems relatively quickly. I do recommend that you first playthrough the tutorial and understand the basic gameplay concepts and mechanics. It’s a different enough game that it really should be mandatory otherwise it’s likely that you will find yourself dying quickly and often when it comes to the legitimate levels, of which there are 16, in the game.\n\nI was a big fan of the game’s presentation starting with the music and the comic stylistics of the graphics. It’s loaded chock full of charm that will take your breath away. When gameplay does get underway after the cool introduction it puts you in head first. It’s not easy from the beginning and you should take this as a sign of things to come. Other than just putting out and extinguishing fires you will have to do your job and save the myriad numbers of civilians that are spread out throughout each level. You need to do this concurrently to putting out the fires because each time you do you are awarded with an  extra minute of time to complete the level.\n\nThe physics are pretty spectacular in the game as well. You’ll think that you’re on top of the fire and then holy shitburgers something you had forgotten about has shot a fireball restarting the blaze somewhere else. Thus you’re going to want that extra time I just told you about because fires will restart seemingly at will unless you’re super careful and Super Blazed. The blazing trail of destruction left by the fireballs will have you raging but will also aide you in becoming a better, smarter player. In that way the game asks a lot from your gaming ability but once you do learn you’ll feel as though you’ve grown as a player not only of this game but of others as well. I believe it takes a good game to do that.\n\nThis is one of those games that people will cry ‘rogue-like’ and where Total Biscuit’s discussion video about gaming terms he’d like people to avoid fits right in. Yes, it’s brutally difficult. Yes, it has some of the trademarks that would fit the genre but at the same time I wouldn’t classify it as a rogue-like. What I would classify it as is a bloody good game that you should at the very least try.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group and curation please join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 28","true","10.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rachelkitten/recommended/345080/","rachelkitten","Rachel 🐾🐾","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rachelkitten/","800 products in account","Let's just get this out of the way right now: I love this game.\n\nThere is something about roguelikes that I love. Except almost all of them try to be copycat versions of another game. Rarely does a game try to actually do something unique! So what makes Flame Over so different? Is it because you're slogging through a dungeon/space station fighting enemies, drinking potions that you aren't sure could kill you? No.  Nothing like that. You're fighting an enemy. That enemy is fire. Electrical fires and regular fires. There are flame overs as well as fire that spit out embers which can set other things alight!\n\nYou're a fireman aptly named Blaze. The game takes place at Infernal Industries. There are 4 levels with each level containing 4 different segments. These are procedurally generated floors consisten of cooridors and room setpieces. The fire is random. Some rooms are ablaze with several people in them.\n\nYou try to rescue people, and cats. There is also Miss Ion who won't leave until you do some task for her. She lost her purse, she needs you to find and post the secret documents, she needs to to enter the vault and secure the valuables, or she needs you to back up the servers. There are other things, but I won't spoil that here. You can level up, Blaze, by completing these tasks. You are awarded some coin as well to purchase upgrades. People give you bonus time and cats give you bonus hearts. There is also a shop where you can buy temporary upgrades. Perhaps the best ones are the super hose and the large water tank.\n\nSo what makes this game so fun? There is just something enjoyable about putting out fires. It isn't so much that I feel like I'm helping people or the cats that are in the building. It's just that it changes every time. This doesn't get old. No fire is the same. I have played lots of Roguelike games that tend to do the same thing as the others, this doesn't do that.\n\nOf course, it isn't a perfect game. Like most roguelikes you get good runs and terrible runs. Sometimes you'll run out of time, others, you'll have more than enough time and this is needed for the later levels. If you die and manage to get back to the level that you died, you can regain your old items. Of course, this doesn't apply if you select a level that you died on. Sometimes you don't get the chance to save people. A fire will spit some embers or a flame over will happen and they die instantly. Unless you have a resucitate them, they remain down, once they are dead you lose 10 seconds. This is somewhat unfair since there is no way to get items other than the random shop. You can find extra time and money though.\n\nAlso, when you run out of time Death will chase you around the map. Which is a bit funny. You can actually manage to drive death away if you can get people through the fire exit.\n\nThere are some things that I would love to see in this game. I would love to see an infinite mode where the time limit is removed. Also a time trial mode to see how many rooms you can clear in a given time. I would like to see more variety in the people you rescue, more women for instance. I think that the upgrade system needs a little tweaking as I was easily able to max everything out after just a few runs. Not necessarily just make things more difficult, but add a few more perks. Maybe this is something that can be made in the sequel?\n\nThere are a few other suggestions. For example with the electrical fires. You have to flip the main breaker to remove power, however, this doesn't change any of the lighting nor does it remove power from the servers that you're supposed to back up. These aren't major issues however. Perhaps once the fire is out the timer can stop? Sometimes you'll clear the map and be at the farthest point from the door. Having rescued everyone already, you have to trudge across the map to clear the level.\n\nOne other very minor complaint is that the game doesn't constrain the mouse to the window on a multi-screen setup. In fullscreen, this makes it possible to glitch the game out by accidentally clicking outside of the window and then the renderer gets confused/broken. A save and resume would be nice as sometimes if you're having a really good run, you need to take a break and it would be great if you could just resume at the same "level" that you were.\n\nThe music is catchy and jazzy if a bit repetetive, however, it does get different mixes depending on the level that you're on it also speeds up in the same way that Super Mario Bros. did when you were running out of time. Overall the sound is good. It would be nice if maybe the people could cough more than once after initially entering a room. Also the cat makes no sound to let you know it's there. There is a strange music levels problem from when you are in the main screen to when you play a game. In game it is much louder than in the main screen. You can turn off the sound of the coins and the feet.\n\nThere are a good number of items hearts, stopwatches, hoses, water tanks, extinguishers, axes, masks, night vision goggles, and other things that can help you through your task.\n\nThe camera is funky, but works. You can rotate it with the middle mouse, if there is a key to set it back to default, I haven't found it. It would have been nice to just have a hotbar for the various power ups and then we could use the number keys to activate them.\n\nFully rebindable keys is a nice thing to have although the defaults are just fine.\n\nIn closing, I have very little negative things to say about this game. The game even provides advice: Don't rush it. Take it one room and cooridor at a time. I haven't mentioned the graphics, but it's very cute.

At first the game is very challenging but after a while you will begin working out ways of extinguishing fires that match how you play. I usually play carefully. I extinguish one half of the room with the extinguisher first. This means that as long as you stop the fire from spreading you have a safe haven. Water balloons should only be used if you are being over run with fire and need to cool down. Don't open doors until you are certain you are ready and wait before you run into rooms.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZalotAngel/recommended/345080/","ZalotAngel","ZalotAngel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZalotAngel/","237 products in account","You can see my full review of it here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgwQH3w3UYs\n\nFlame Over is a rogue like, firefighting, twin stick shooter that has you play the role of Blaze Carruthers as you fight your way through 16 floors of a burning building of various levels, putting out the fires and trying to save civilians and cats. The game has a very simple premise, but because of it's simple premise, you can find it quite addicting. Controlling Blaze can be a bit of a struggle at first, since you move him the left stick and rotate the camera with the right (Like a normal video game) but pulling either of the triggers will make you aim with the right stick instead of rotating the camera. Since this means you have to stop using the fire extinguisher or the hose just to turn the camera, it lead to time wasting, but that's not necessarily a bad thing since time is always counting down regardless of what you are doing within the level, so it leads to a few decisions making in which you can decide either to save this person or leave them because you are running out of time.\n\nThe civilians and cats aren't there just to fill empty space and add urgency to your mission (Though it does do a good job at making the game more intense) they give you bonuses if you save them. Each civilian you save grants you one minute of extra time which is very crucial to progressing through each level and floor. If you do end up running out of time, the grim reaper will spawn within the level and hunt you down and kill you the moment he touches you, adding another sense of urgency. Cats, on the other hand, give you a heart of each one you save (Maximum of 5) which is your health and it carries over through each floor and level. You don't have to save everyone, but with each person you let die, takes ten seconds off your remaining time.\n\nThere are two different ways of fighting the fire, one is a fire extinguisher which is used to put out fires on electrical equipment (Phones, computers, vending machines etc) but can become useless once you turn off all the electrics at the generator that is in each level somewhere. A second way is your hose, which is what you'll use the most, since it has decent reach and sprays water quite effectively. Lastly, you have water bombs, which you can throw and will splash water in a large area and douse the fire. Both the fire extinguisher and the hose will require water, so you will eventually run out and need to refill at either a water cooler, drinking fountain or at the entrance of the level. Water bombs do not require a refill, instead, you'll have to either find them or buy them at the shop.\n\nObviously, the fire itself is the main issue, not just because its a fire (Duh) but because of how it spreads. The game promotes realistic fire spreading but that's not entirely true. The can fire can sometimes spread from one object to another like a real fire does, but it has a habit of materializing into a ball of fire and flinging itself across the room or into the next, sometimes leaving a trail of fire till it lands. Unfortunately, it seems to purposely aim for you only when it becomes a ball of fire, making it a bit annoying to deal with.\n\nAs a firefighter, Blaze seems have a low tolerance to heat and fires. Each room you enter that has a fire within it, can lead to a gauge appearing around him symbolizing how much heat he is taking. Once it is completely full, you will lose one heart from your health, which means you have to move away from the fire before the gauge is filled. Not entering the room however, doesn't raise the heat gauge, meaning you can stand outside the room and spray water in without risking your health.\n\nIt may not be the best looking game in it's graphics but it's artistic design and measure make it stand out and look unique, as something that is graphicly impressing can have boring gameplay, but a game that has a specific art design that suits it can make it more appealing.\n\nThe AI however are another problem within the game. With every person you save from the fire, you have to lead them to the entrance of the level to save them. However, they don't follow a direct path, instead, the follow you exactly, leading to them running into walls and objects and getting stuck.\n\nAt the end of it, it is very similar to Spelunky in it's design. It's challenging, addicting and quite fun, with that sense of urgency to each level as you try to save everyone while getting rid of the fire as you race against the clock. For a cheap little game with an interesting design and cartoony style graphics that make it more appealing, it's worth the asking price for hours of entertainment and content.","May 28, 2015","true","0.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

I spent 60 minutes in-game so far, and it felt like 10. Its a fun game without the worry of "what does this potion do this round" as other rouge-likes tend to do. I don't yet know how I feel about the upgrades being a persistent feature, but it is that way and works fine.\n\nThere are a few negative features of this game though. The maps seem to still feel a bit too consistent, as well as dizzying with the rotating camera feature. My ps4 controller, which works fine in gtaV and other games, is mapped wrong in flame over, with no way to remap it to my controller(not even a config file I could find). The background music might get repetitive as well, and it doesn't loop smoothly.\n\nThis game seems like a something I can go to just to pass time every now and then, but to be better at this the game needs a bit shorter delays on the menus. This gets combined with controls for the camera by default being useless for a laptop without a middle click.\nIt sounds like I am complaining more than anything, but that's because this is overall a good game. I easily recommend for anyone who just wants to have some fun.\n\nOverall, if the developers push a few more updates then this game will stay fun for years.\nEDIT:\nSetting the minimap to rotation locked helps not get lost. I found it helpful to turn off motionblur as well. As for the other comments I said, mostly still true. My ps4 controller still does not work properly and I couldn't find a workaround (granted this might be unity's fault). I still would recommend this game, but note that it is not flawless.","May 28, 2015","true","7.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","1"

It definitely has a unique premise, but is the gameplay compelling enough?  I've had a chance to play it for a few hours so let's  find out in this first impression.\n\nIn Flame Over you play as a firefighter named Blazer Carruthers and quite simply you put out the fires.  It's a roguelike, which means levels are procedural generated and death is permanent.  In Flame Over there are four different game zones that are very similar in design, but have different looks.  You start off in the fire station and make your way through the levels, putting out as much of the fire as you can. Using the right trigger you shoot water from your hose and the left trigger uses the extinguisher.  You need to use the water kfor big fires and the extinguisher to eliminate electrical fires.  It's interesting how you need more than one tool to get the job done.  Your supplies run out, but there are refills at the base and throughout the level.  What's also interesting is that you can find an emergency shut off for electricity which will end electrical fires.\n\nAlong your way you'll run into people who need help escaping.  When you bring them back you gain additional time to complete your objective.  There's also the stereotypical firefighter saving a cat motif when you randomly find cats to save.  Some people will ask you to find their personal belongings, but you are too damn busy saving everyone in the building! Put out all the fires, head to exit, and you'll get your reward.  When you put out fires you'll receive money that you can use for special items and different types of buffs.\n\nThe art style of Flame Over is very suitable.  It softens the theme of saving people from a burning building and keeps the game fun instead of dramatic.  The flame effect looks nice and is very easy to spot when you enter the room.  For an isometric roguelike, this game looks very attractive.  Textures look detailed and the flame effects are perfect for the setting.\n\nYou may think this game is a cakewalk, but it's not.  There is definitely high challenge as fires spread and reform rapidly if you don't extinguish the entire room.  You'll be surprised how fast the game moves once you are in the inferno.  There's plenty of resource management between saving civilians and rationing your supplies.  You'll never find yourself with downtime during rounds.  The action is perfectly balanced.\n\nFlame Over is a surprisingly fun and charming game.  You get to be a real hero for once and save lives, but the game doesn't take itself to seriously.  It's only $12 on Steam and although the amount of zones are small, the game does have re-playability since it's a roguelike.  If this game looks like it fits your style, you may want to check it out.  I recommend it.","May 28, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","5","10","0","0"

It reminds me of Sega Saturn’s Burning Rangers, except you get a top down, almost twin stick shooter format with two modes of putting out fires. Water puts out flames, and foam puts out stubborn sources of fire. You also have to watch you oxygen while you rescue people and return them to the starting point. You can find power ups and upgrades, or just buy them from the merchant who decided opening up shop in the middle of a burning building made sense. Whatever, just go with it, putting out fires is fun and the random nature of the game means you can play it a bunch before getting bored. Grab a controller, the keyboard isn’t recommended.","June 4, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The dialogue is really good and I love how the game centres around a guy who is obviously going through post traumatic stress.  Having grown up an American with 3 cousins and an brother who are FDNY firefighters and members of the FDNY Emerald Society Pipes and Drums, I am impressed with the personalities of the characters, the situations, and the whole game overall is just so real.\n\nFlame Over brings a mixture of comedy and drama and it works perfectly, with the characters and art style using dark humour to hide how significantly the events of 9/11 have altered their lives. Blaze Carruthers the main character, who has, among other things, a drinking problem, a drug problem, a marriage that has fallen apart, and survivor's guilt is probably one of the more interesting characters in gaming whom I think we can all relate to in many dimensions of his life and personality. All in all Flame Over is an amazing game that is a powerful meditation on post 9/11 society and a tribute to the hard work and service that firefighters do every day.\n\n5/10","August 10, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

It's still challenging, though, and I still find myself dying more often than winning.\n\nCons:\n-Some upgrades are 100% necessary to get a decent time.  If you don't have the large water tank by stage 3, you'll have to refill your water tank somewhere (sometimes the only area where you can do so is the beginning of the level)\n-There's no description of what power ups do, not even a glossary.  The fact that the game is relatively unknown means that the wiki page (if there even is one) contains zero to little information\n-There's no FPS cap option, so if you don't like playing with Vsync on, prepare to be maxing your video card as it renders 400+ frames per second\n-The fire extinguisher feels very weak, despite the claim that it "puts fires out faster" than water, it doesn't prevent the fire from spreading, so you end up using far more extinguisher foam than you would water.  Not to mention the foam can disrupt your vision, making it difficult to see where the fire actually is (double dangerous when the green fire comes into play)\n\nI like playing this game, and I find myself returning to it every once in a while to do a run or two.","June 30, 2015","true","18.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The gameplay is awful, everything about this game is terrible.  Its a simple idea but with so little polish it still feels like an alpha build.  Oddly this game is a port from the Vita so one would think it would be a finished or better product for PC but its actually worse.  This game once it got greenlit literally became abandonware the next day with the devs vanishing never to return to the community or fix any of the issues of the game.\n\nThis game has zero polish making it feel alpha.  The rooms have doors that are impossible to see without rotating the camera.  This could have been eliminated via putting breaks in the walls where a door is but instead they just gave up on game development.  Worse is that the door if you open it might kill you.  If there is any fire on a door it instantly kills the player.  This would happen alot less if we knew where the doors were.  This game has a time limit so all this camera sweeping to look for doors which could be anywhere takes alot of that time away which is gamebreaking for a game that requires a timer.\n\nThis game you need to rescue civilians but they just fall over and die when entering rooms sometimes.  Other times there can be fire nowhere near them and they still just fall over and die.  One of the worst things is there can be civilians who want an item like a woman who wants her purse.  She will literally just stand in one spot and die if you dont bring her purse.\n\nThe firefighter literally cant handle fire.  There can be a tiny fire in a room and the heat will build if you cant find it then you just die.  You can walk into a room for 2 seconds and die from the heat.  This firefighter literally has no protection at all.\n\nThe controls are terrible.  The camera moves using the same thumbsticks as rotating the character.  This makes playing the game a nightmare because you cant move the camera independently of changing your characters focus.  This could have easily been fixed by putting the camera on the right bumper and left bumper.  but why bother playing the game?  most devs dont they just make it completely clueless about game design being more code monkey than anything related to actual game making.  Anyone can make a game today, 8 year olds can and have and they work better than games like this.\n\nThe WORST part of this game is if it just randomly deletes your game save.   This game is treated like garbage by the devs who just threw it on steam never bothering to fix anything making this game the literal garbage of steam and like all trash it should be removed from the steam store.\n\nThe devs dont care about the game and ran away once it was greenlit, so if the devs dont care about their own game why should anyone else care to buy it?\n\nRating:  0/10  Value: $0.00","November 4, 2015","false","20.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","2"

There are some major glitches involving upgrades, which end up making the game way too hard. There is also no way to save a game and resume it later, which makes actually beating the game agonizingly time consuming. Every four stages you unlock a new stage to start at, however you start with the same basic equipment regardless of which stage you begin with. This makes starting at later stages strategically meaningless, but also makes actually beating the game agonizingly time consuming.\n\nI had a good deal of fun with it, as the main gameplay ideas (fight fires, save people) are pretty fun as presented here. However the game seems to really get in the way of itself, and I found myself more frustrated with the limitations presented than enjoying the progression of the game.\n\nCould easily be patched and improved, but developers seem to have abandoned it.

One of my favorites is "Firefighter Command: Raging Inferno" by Monte Cristo and released by Kudosoft.  It was more of an RTS style game which worked great in my opinioon for a fire fighting game.  "Flame Over" by Laughing Jackal, on the other hand, is an arcade style fire fighting game that is fun in a different way.  The difficulty is higher than I expected, and has a reasonable learning curve to master the game.  I have only played for an hour or so, but besides feeling it is rather difficult, it is a nice game with enjoyable music.  I've been playing with the keyboard thus far, and will have to see if using a controller works better for me.  I'll follow-up again after playing a while longer.","June 18, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are amazing, and the controls are wasd, easy to control!\n\nIn this game, you are a fireman who's job is to rescue people (and cats) from a burning building whilst also having to put out all the fire. If you've ever played Minecraft, then you might find this game a little easier because of the conrols being almost excatly the same.\n\nI reccomend this game to any gamers 10+.\n\nThe only issue (in my opinion) with this game is that there isn't much storyline, therefore the game might get boring quicker for the older (Age 13+) players.\n\nIf you do buy this game, I hope you enjoy it!","July 5, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't let its simple cartoony look fool you into thinking that this game is catered to a casual audience, the game is challenging and engaging.  The goal of the game is to put out fires which is just as engaging as mowing through popcorn enemies in a dungeon crawler, which is what this game resembles more than a fire-fighting simulator.  Managing the spread of the fire, making sure to rescue trapped people and cats to give yourself additional time and health, both of which you'll need because the game is a gauntlet - the ultimate goal is to get from start to finish in a single play through, which I have yet to be able to do.\n\nThe camera can be a bit of a pain, especially if you're playing with Mouse + Keyboard.  I'd like to see them patch in culling any walls that are hiding flames. You'll often need to rotate the camera around completely to see flames next to the door of the room you just entered.  I would suggest playing the game with a gamepad, the camera controls are much less of a hassle.","August 2, 2015","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It does not forgive, it is difficult. You have to react quickly to every room. This game through the last stage turns into a fast pace game not only would you have to blow out fire but save civilians and cats as well as collecting items and doing important side missions.\n\nSo get this game if want a bit of good challenge twin stick shooter.\nPs. I recommend playing this game with controller.","August 5, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theothercan/recommended/345080/","Theothercan","Theothercan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Theothercan/","152 products in account","Just shy of 100 hours of play time and after getting all of the Steam achievements I finally think I'm ready to write a fair review of this game. Needless to say I enjoyed it quite a bit. There were several things that I disliked throughout my play time, but with as much as the community has contributed with their experience I was able to get through all that the game had to offer.\n\nWe'll start with my dislikes; There wasn't enough information given about the in game items from the developer and I actually had to contact them directly multiple times to get accurate describtions. Furthermore the in game shop was never designed to prevent items that you've already bought from showing up again, and there's nothing stoping a player from accidently double purchasing something he or she already has. The upgrade store where you spend your tokens is only available when you have enough tokens saved up to buy an upgrade, but this mechanic wasn't exactly transparent to myself or other players from what I've read on the forums.  In my opinion it would have been better if they made the shop visable from the menu at all times even if you didn't have enough tokens to buy an upgrade. One of the most annoying mechanics in this game involved fireballs spawning when you open a rooms door. The NPC's in the game were seemingly randomly placed within rooms, and more times then I can count I would open a door and hear the sound of a fireball immediately spawn further in the room and then later find a dead NPC that was instakilled by said fireball. This mechanic is by definition anti-fun in that there is absolutely no way to counter play it and it made one of the achievements quite difficult to get. I must have prayed to RNGesus a thousand times before I was actually able to make it through a complete run without losing an NPC that way. On the topic of NPC's they are slower than your character and when they get too far behind they just stop moving, which is a much smaller issue, but still quite annoying when you're trying to herd six of them to safety and little Jimmy refuses to pick up his feet and move.\n\nOkay okay, on to the good; The random level generation makes the games replayability great. The power boost gained from store items feels very signifigant (Super hose!!) and makes a run much more rewarding. Though very repetative, the music is actually quite catchy and I like it. The cartoonish artistic style is also very cool, and I think it adds allot to the fun of the game. I'm sure there's more, but I feel like I'm dragging on so I'll just end by saying that I highly recommend this game and I hope the devs get a chance to address the issues I've experianced.\n\nP.S. Dance With The Devil on PC; Clear level two, spray shop keep in face with extinguisher and steal items, clear level 3 and then 4, goto shop in level 4 and shop keep will tell you that you won't steal from him again, wait for time to run out and meet Satan.","August 6, 2015","true","93.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A non-violent computer game that I actually like.\nAdmittedly, I haven't spent numerous hours with this yet.  This is just my first play session.\nBut this doesn't strike me as a marathon quest type of game.  More of a 20 minutes here, 45 minutes there sort of thing.\nAnd I'm not there to kill anybody.  ...I'm not entirely sure how I feel about that.\n\nSo... how does one do this.\nPros:\n- Good if cartoony artwork.\n- Procedurally generated levels.  That means 'Random' levels for those of you out there that are my age.\n- Fires are fun if rather dangerous to fight.\n- Saving kitties!\n- The controls take a bit of learning, but they aren't difficult and KB + Mouse works very well.  I'm guessing one of those\nnew fangled twin stick jobs would work also.\n\nCons:\n- While the music isn't bad per se, the repeating track is rather short and I'm already ready to turn it off.\n- One difficulty level and one save slot.  I don't think the save slot is a serious issue.  The only thing failing a mission does\nis list you as having a "loss" or a "DNF" or a Death... which is also a "DNF."  But if your spouse want to try he or she has\nto use your character and upgrades and stuff.  *Blech*  (By the way, I’m told DNF stands for Did Not Finish.  In case you\nwere in the dark about that.)\n- The tutorial level has the standard time limit.  Which means you will be unlikely to know how things work till you\naccidently get really good at the game.\n\nOverall I'm liking this so far and do recommend it.  Buuuut my limited time playing limits my authority to recommend this.  But I'm recommending it anyway.  Even if I don’t get to hurt anyone.\n","February 14","true","0.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

I beat the game twice one after the other in less than 7 hrs of playtime. I didn't even encounter some of the items of which there actually aren't that many. Thats testament to how few runs I did or how few shops I encountered before doing the winning runs I suppose . Also Its not like I just had a god setup for both wins. The second one I didn't get any 'weapon upgrades'.\n\nFor under $3 it was worth it.\n\n(I used keyboard and mouse with every run starting from the office)","January 5","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
